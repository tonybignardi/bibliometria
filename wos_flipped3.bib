Abstract = {Background and purpose: The flipped teaching method was implemented
   through a series of multiple condensed videos for pharmaceutical
   calculations with student perceptions and academic performance assessed
   post-intervention.
   Educational activity and setting: Student perceptions from the
   intervention group were assessed via an online survey. Pharmaceutical
   exam scores of the intervention group were compared to the control
   group. The intervention group spent a greater amount of class time on
   active learning.
   Findings: The majority of students (68.2\%) thought that the flipped
   teaching method was more effective to learn pharmaceutical calculations
   than the traditional method. The mean exam scores of the intervention
   group were not significantly different than the control group (80.5 +/-
   15.8\% vs 77.8 +/- 16.8\%; p = 0.253).
   Discussion: Previous studies on the flipped teaching method have shown
   mixed results in regards to student perceptions and exam scores, where
   either student satisfaction increased or exam scores improved, but
   rarely both.
   Summary: The flipped teaching method was rated favorably by a majority
   of students. The flipped teaching method resulted in similar outcomes in
   pharmaceutical calculations exam scores, and it appears to be an
   acceptable and effective option to deliver pharmaceutical calculations
   in a Doctor of Pharmacy program.},

Title = {Investigating temporal access in a flipped classroom: procrastination
   persists},
Journal = {INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF EDUCATIONAL TECHNOLOGY IN HIGHER EDUCATION},
Year = {2018},
Volume = {15},
Month = {JAN 9},
Abstract = {This paper reports on a study that examines the learning behaviors and
   characteristics of students in a mobile applications computer
   programming class that adopted a ``flipped{''} learning style. By
   harvesting learning analytics data from a learning management system, we
   created visualizations of work intensity to explore temporal patterns of
   students' behavior and then correlate them with the students'
   performance. Findings indicate that low, medium, and high performing
   students tend to access learning materials late with work intensity
   spiking on the lecture day, specifically during the lecture session.
   While high and low performing students show no difference in temporal
   access to material, medium performing students demonstrate the greatest
   degree of vibrancy regarding course content material access. Further a
   discussion of implications and insights on procrastination in the
   context of flipped classrooms are included.},

Abstract = {A laboratory-safety course has been developed that is designed to
   introduce first-year graduate students to the array of dangers
   associated with research in the chemical sciences. We describe the
   challenges of creating an impactful course that seeks to convey
   practical laboratory-safety information in a classroom setting for
   students with a diverse array of interests. In particular, we have found
   that a flipped-classroom model highlighting case studies creates a
   concrete experience that actively engages course participants. In
   addition, the introduction of various pedagogical tools, including
   active-learning techniques (field trips, role-playing games, and group
   projects), were triggered in large part by recommendations from the
   students themselves.},

Abstract = {Medical education is evolving and electronic learning (e-Learning)
   strategies have now become an essential asset in radiology education.
   Radiology education is a significant part of the undergraduate medical
   curriculum and the use of e-Learning in radiology teaching in medical
   schools is on the rise. If coupled with clinical decision support
   systems, e-Learning can be a practical way of teaching students clinical
   decision making, such as selecting the diagnostic imaging tests that are
   best suited in certain clinical scenarios.
   The innovative concept of flipped classroom learning encourages students
   to work independently and maximises the application of learnt contents
   in interactive classroom sessions.
   For integrated curricula with their student-centred, problem-based, and
   community-based design, an approach to systematically integrate
   radiology may be to define diagnostic reasoning as one of the core
   goals. Radiologists as teachers and scholars may understand themselves
   as experts in diagnostic reasoning and in mentoring how to make medical
   decisions.
   Computer programs simulating the routine work are available and can be
   used to teach the recognition of anatomical structures and pathological
   patterns, and also to teach ultrasonography and interventional
   radiology, maximising patient safety.},

Abstract = {An increasing number of researchers and practitioners with an interest
   in ESP have begun to consider the role that information communication
   technologies can play in the classroom. In addition, recent work in
   English for Specific Business Purposes has emphasized the importance of
   introducing more computer-mediated communication into the curriculum, in
   an effort to help learners to develop the skills they will need in the
   workplace. In this article I discuss a business English course for
   undergraduate students in the Gulf Region with three areas of focus,
   that addresses this concern: (i) it combines a flipped classroom
   approach and a project-based learning approach, (ii) it presents
   students with a series of mobile learning tasks that centre on a set of
   three interdependent instructional goals, i.e. interaction, production
   and reflection, and (iii) it allows students to develop their skills in
   two specific areas related to computer-mediated communication in the
   workplace, i.e. dealing with different audiences and selecting
   appropriate media. My aim is to give an account of a real classroom
   experience of relevance for the teaching of English for Specific
   Business Purposes at tertiary level.},

Abstract = {Animation films were used frequently during online didactic activities
   during the COVID-19 pandemic. We have not identified research that
   focuses on the problems that teachers face when using animated films to
   enable students' learning of Natural Sciences and on the training models
   that can be organized based on this resource. Therefore, we analysed the
   problems faced by teachers and, to solve them, we identified, analysed,
   and described several instruction models based on animation films:
   illustrative, expositive, interactive, flipped classroom, learning
   through discovery, and learning through simulation. We analysed the way
   to integrate them into the didactic activity and, finally, we realized

Abstract = {The use of the flipped classroom (FC) methodology in biochemistry
   learning was investigated in the Biological Sciences degree course of a
   Federal Public Institution. The subjects were 20 students in the
   discipline of Systems Biochemistry with a workload of 60 hours. FC
   characterized as an approach by which the student must study the content
   and a face-to-face class as an extension and practical application of
   the studied concepts. To investigate, we conducted a descriptive,
   observational and field research with a qualitative approach. To collect
   the data, three activities related to the content of cellular
   respiration were applied, such as productions of the activities
   submitted to the content analysis. It was possible to observe strong
   evidence using the potential for using SAI in the formation of complex
   concepts in biochemistry, favoring the different learning styles of
   students. The data shown, despite the barriers to overcoming the
   progress of the experience, the implementation of learning models and
   innovative attitudes contributed a lot, especially for the student who
   gauges the penalty or learned in the discipline, showing what he learned
   during the class, solving problems, work collaboratively and make a
   difference in your future profession.},

Journal = {JOURNAL OF BALTIC SCIENCE EDUCATION},

Abstract = {The Flipped Classroom (FC) is a teaching approach in which students gain
   the first-exposure learning with online materials outside the classroom,
   and then, in the classroom, they focus on interactive or engaging
   exercises. Despite its considerable publicity, the studies focused on
   the FC in primary education are deficient. The aim of this research is
   to determine efficiency and students' involvement in the flipped Biology
   classroom in primary school, compared to the conventional classroom (CC)
   approach. Educational efficiency and students' involvement are measured
   by combining the values of the students' performance and mental effort
   on the test. Each task in the test was followed by the 5-point Likert
   scale for evaluation of invested mental effort. The total sample of this
   research included 112 students, aged from 12 to 13. The results show
   that the FC approach contributes to the reduction of the students'
   mental effort and an increase in the students' performance. On the basis
   of calculated efficiency and students' involvement of applied teaching
   approaches, it was concluded that the FC represents a feasible and
   efficient approach to Biology primary education.},

Abstract = {The aim of this paper is to describe a case study on which we describe
   the methodology we are employing with these Gen Z student group to
   motivate and catch their attention, and we analyze if this adaptation of
   our teaching style has developed in a better development of our
   performance. In an attempt to move away from professor-centered to
   student-centered learning, the proposed methodology makes use of not
   only direct instruction technique but also new strategies such as
   flipped classroom or collaborative learning. The purpose is to make
   particle technology more appealing as a subject to this new generation
   of students by emphasizing the self-learning, do-it-yourself, lifelong
   learning approaches. The students' results show that, from 2007 onwards,
   there is a slight increasing in the number of students with A or B
   grades, which can partially be assumed to be a consequence of the
   methodological techniques. From the students' assessment, it can be
   concluded that they perceive that taking this subject is worthy, as they
   finally achieve a high degree of learning, so they recommend it to the
   next generations.},

Title = {Predictors of Pharmacy Student Performance on Written and Clinical
   Examinations in a Flipped Classroom Curriculum},
Journal = {AMERICAN JOURNAL OF PHARMACEUTICAL EDUCATION},
Year = {2020},
Volume = {84},
Number = {12},
Pages = {1627-1636},
Month = {DEC 1},
Abstract = {Objective. To examine the effects of student demographics, prior
   academic performance, course engagement, and time management on pharmacy
   students' performance on course examinations and objective structured
   clinical examinations (OSCEs).
   Methods. Study participants were one cohort of pharmacy students
   enrolled in a five-year combined Bachelor and Master of Pharmacy degree
   program at one institution. Variables included student demographics,
   baseline factors (language assessment and situational judgement test
   scores), prior academic performance (high school admission rank), course
   engagement, and student time management of pre-class online activities.
   Data were collected from course, learning management system, and
   institutional databases. Data were analyzed for univariate, bivariate,
   and multivariate associations (four linear regression models) between
   explanatory factors and outcome variables.
   Results. Three years of data on 159 pharmacy students were obtained and
   entered in the dataset. Significant positive predictors of OSCE
   communication performance included domestic (ie, Australian) student
   designation, higher baseline written English proficiency, and pre-class
   online activity completion. Positive predictors of OSCE problem-solving
   included workshop attendance and low empathy as measured by a baseline
   situational judgment test (SJT). Positive predictors of performance on
   year 2 end-of-course examinations included the Australian Tertiary
   Academic Rank, completing pre-class online activities prior to lectures,
   and high integrity as measured by an SJT.
   Conclusion. Several explanatory factors predicted pharmacy students'
   examination and OSCE performance in the regression models. Future
   research should continue to study additional contexts, explanatory
   factors, and outcome variables.},

Abstract = {The flipped classroom gives students the flexibility to organize their
   learning, while teachers can monitor their progress analyzing their
   online activity. In massive courses where there are a variety of
   activities, automated analysis techniques are required in order to
   process the large volume of information that is generated, to help
   teachers take timely and appropriate actions. In these scenarios, it is
   convenient to classify students into a small number of groups that can
   receive dedicated support. Using only online activity to group students
   has proven to be insufficient to characterize relevant groups, because
   of that this study proposes to understand differences in online activity
   using differences in course status and learning experience, using data
   from a programming course (n = 409). The model built shows that learning
   experience can be categorized in three groups, each with different
   academic performance and distinct online activity. The relationship
   between groups and online activity allowed us to build classifiers to
   detect students who are at risk of failing the course (AUC = 0.84) or
   need special support (AUC = 0.73), providing teachers with a useful
   mechanism for predicting and improving student outcomes.},

Abstract = {IntroductionEvidence-based medicine (EBM) and literature searching
   skills are competencies within the emergency medicine (EM) residency
   curriculum. Previously in our residency program, a librarian taught
   literature searching instruction, including a classroom-based overview
   of search engines. Learners reported low engagement and poor retention.
   To improve engagement, interest, and skill retention, we used a novel
   approach: simulation to teach real-time literature searching.
   MethodsBased on a needs assessment of our EM residents, we created a
   literature searching workshop using a flipped classroom approach and
   high-fidelity simulation. Goals of the session were to be interactive,
   engaging, and practice-relevant. With a librarian, we developed a brief
   list of EM-relevant databases, including tips for searching and links to
   sites/apps. Prereadings also covered the hierarchy of evidence and
   formulating a good clinical (PICO) question. Residents (12 junior
   residents) participated in a high-fidelity simulation involving a stable
   patient whose management required a literature search to inform
   decisions. Feedback was collected on the simulation experience.
   ResultsResidents received the list of EM-relevant databases 7 days prior
   and were instructed to set up and test the resources on their
   smartphones. The day of the session, one resident volunteered to lead
   the simulation; all residents participated in the search on their smart
   phones. Collectively, it took 4.5 minutes to find a study that
   adequately addressed the clinical question and to manage the patient
   accordingly. Feedback on the simulation was positive. Students found it
   ``very real and practical{''} and ``immediately institutable into
   practice.{''} It helped residents learn to efficiently and effectively
   search the literature while managing a stable patient.
   ConclusionA flipped-classroom simulation-based teaching strategy made
   learning literature searching more interesting, engaging, and applicable
   to EM practice. Based on popular demand, we will continue to use this
   teaching method.},

Abstract = {A growing body of literature points to the need to rethink the
   traditional lecture-based teaching methodology. The flipped classroom is
   a pedagogical model in which students are exposed to new material
   outside of the classroom via lecture videos, assigned readings, or other
   online videos or resources while the traditional face-to-face classroom
   sessions are repurposed for assimilating and applying knowledge gained
   through discussions, hands-on activities and problem solving. The
   authors investigate the effectiveness of a flipped class by examining
   student academic performance, course content coverage, retention of
   students in courses, and student perception of flipped classes. The
   results demonstrate improved student performance, improved course
   retention, and positive student perception, with minimal loss of
   content.},

Title = {A hybrid learning pedagogy for surmounting the challenges of the
   COVID-19 pandemic in the performing arts education},
Journal = {EDUCATION AND INFORMATION TECHNOLOGIES},

Abstract = {For performing arts education, Sage on the stage and Learn from the
   Masters were halted by the COVID-19 pandemic, and so did everything
   else. All lectures, tutorials and other face-to-face skill-based
   training sections were cancelled and were replaced by the online model.
   Such a model was only seen as one of the supplementary components for
   performing arts education in the past. From January 2020, this online
   pedagogy was inevitably placed to surmount the challenges caused by the
   COVID-19 pandemic. The social distancing measures demanded the blended
   pedagogy into a new online approach, in which the traditional
   face-to-face teaching to be replaced by synchronous online learning
   (facilitated by technologies such as Zoom, Cisco Webex, Google Class,
   Panopto etc.). Meanwhile, to offer opportunities for cognitive
   participation which allows students to process the learning and be
   reflective, webinar and innovative performance projects were launched
   from the concept of `flipped classroom and outcome-based education.'
   This mixed approach (blended learning, flipped classroom, and
   outcome-based education) is described as `hybrid learning' in this
   study.
   The `hybrid learning' pedagogy is implemented at the Hong Kong Academy
   for Performing Arts (HKAPA) for all teaching activities in the 2nd
   semester 2020/2021 to overcome the challenges caused by the COVID-19
   pandemic. A questionnaire survey about how it affected the performing
   arts education, and how the new pedagogy was implemented took place in
   July 2020. The survey results from both the teachers (76) and students
   (163) share lessons, insights, and new understandings on teaching and
   learning online. Hybrid learning has been widely investigated and
   researched, yet study on hybrid learning in performing arts such as
   creative art, theatre art and music, remains insufficient. This study
   fills the research gap.},

   of 2018. The students in this course built their own SQL-on-Hadoop
   engine as a term project in just 8 weeks. miniHive is written in Python
   and compiles SQL queries into MapReduce workflows. These are then
   executed on Hadoop. miniHive performs generic query optimizations
   (selection and projection pushdown, or cost-based join reordering), as
   well as MapReduce-specific optimizations.
   The course was taught in English, using a flipped classroom model. The
   course material was mainly compiled from third-party teaching videos.
   This report describes the course setup, the miniHive milestones, and
   gives a short review of the most successful student projects.},

Abstract = {The success of innovative teaching/learning approaches aiming to foster
   problem solving in management education depends on useful and
   easy-to-use IT components in the learning process. However, the
   complexity of problem solving in self-regulated learning approaches may
   overwhelm the learner and can lead to unsatisfying learning outcomes.
   Research suggests the implementation of technology-enhanced scaffolds as
   a mechanism to guide the learners in their individual problem-solving
   process to enhance their learning outcomes. We present a theoretical
   model based on adaptive structuration theory and cognitive load theory
   that explains how technology-enhanced scaffolding contributes to
   learning outcomes. We test the model with a fully randomized
   between-subject experiment in a flipped classroom for management
   education focusing on individual problem solving. Our results show that
   technology-enhanced scaffolding contributes significantly to the
   management of cognitive load as well as to learning process satisfaction
   and problem-solving learning outcomes. Thereby, our paper provides new
   conceptual and empirically tested insights for a better understanding of
   technology-enhanced scaffolds and their design to assist problem solving
   and its respective effects in flipped classrooms for management
   education.},

Abstract = {Just-in-time teaching and peer instruction are two student-centred
   approaches that have been widely employed in various science subjects
   but seldom in language classrooms. This research proposed a flipped
   learning model through technology-enhanced just-in-time teaching and
   peer instruction and investigated the effectiveness of this model in
   promoting English learning. Two groups of upper intermediate EFL
   learners participated in the study and learned in two different flipped
   learning modes, one with the newly proposed approach and the other with
   the conventional flipped learning approach. The results showed that the
   proposed model outperformed the conventional model in promoting the
   development of students' writing skills, motivation, and tendency of
   critical thinking. The use of an assessment-centred tool (e.g. EDpuzzle)
   for interactive videos and cloud-based tools for real-time collaboration
   (e.g. Padlet and Google Docs) assisted in creating scaffolded learning
   experience, sharing culture, and opportunities of peer instruction for
   students in the flipped classroom with Just-in-time teaching and peer
   instruction. Such results implied that our flipped learning model is
   very conducive to language learning, and it is advised to be employed
   more widely in various language learning classes.},

Title = {Using learning analytics to evaluate a video-based lecture series},
Journal = {MEDICAL TEACHER},
Year = {2018},
Volume = {40},
Number = {1},
Pages = {91-98},
Abstract = {Background: The video-based lecture (VBL), an important component of the
   flipped classroom (FC) and massive open online course (MOOC) approaches
   to medical education, has primarily been evaluated through direct
   learner feedback. Evaluation may be enhanced through learner analytics
   (LA) - analysis of quantitative audience usage data generated by
   video-sharing platforms.Methods and results: We applied LA to an
   experimental series of ten VBLs on electroencephalography (EEG)
   interpretation, uploaded to YouTube in the model of a publicly
   accessible MOOC. Trends in view count; total percentage of video viewed
   and audience retention (AR) (percentage of viewers watching at a time
   point compared to the initial total) were examined. The pattern of
   average AR decline was characterized using regression analysis,
   revealing a uniform linear decline in viewership for each video, with no
   evidence of an optimal VBL length. Segments with transient increases in
   AR corresponded to those focused on core concepts, indicative of content
   requiring more detailed evaluation. We propose a model for applying LA
   at four levels: global, series, video, and feedback.Discussion and
   conclusions: LA may be a useful tool in evaluating a VBL series. Our
   proposed model combines analytics data and learner self-report for
   comprehensive evaluation.},

Abstract = {This study aims to examine the effect of the flipped learning approach
   on academic achievement through meta-analysis method. The study consists
   of the published articles in scientific journals, master's and doctoral
   theses which have the necessary statistical data. The studies were
   obtained from various databases such as ``EBSCOhost, ProQuest, JSTOR,
   Google Scholar, Turkish Academic Network and Information Center (TUBITAK
   ULAKBIM) Social Sciences Database, Turkish Council of Higher Education
   National Thesis Center and ERIC{''} by using keywords such as ``flipped
   classroom{''}, ``flipped learning{''}, ``academic achievement{''}.
   Within the scope of inclusion criteria, 55 studies were obtained. The
   data set was determined as 80 since the effect of the flipped learning
   approach on academic achievement was analyzed separately for each course
   in some studies. The results of the study reveal that there is a
   positive effect of the flipped learning approach on academic achievement
   compared to traditional learning approach. Besides, there is not a
   significant difference according to the implementation period. The
   effect of flipped learning on academic achievement is higher in small
   groups, and there is a significant difference between the groups
   according to being national/international.},

Abstract = {Based on the flipped-classroom model and the potential motivational and
   instructional benefits of digital games, we describe a flipped
   game-based learning (FGBL) strategy focused on preclass and overall
   learning outcomes. A secondary goal is to determine the effects, if any,
   of the classroom aspects of the FGBL strategy on learning efficiency.
   Our experiments involved 2 commercial games featuring physical motion
   concepts: Ballance (Newton's law of motion) and Angry Birds (mechanical
   energy conservation). We randomly assigned 87 8th-grade students to game
   instruction (digital game before class and lecture-based instruction in
   class), FGBL strategy (digital game before class and cooperative
   learning in the form of group discussion and practice in class), or
   lecture-based instruction groups (no gameplay). Results indicate that
   the digital games exerted a positive effect on preclass learning
   outcomes and that FGBL-strategy students achieved better overall
   learning outcomes than their lecture-based peers. Our observation of
   similar overall outcomes between the cooperative learning and
   lecture-based groups suggests a need to provide additional teaching
   materials or technical support when introducing video games to
   cooperative classroom learning activities.},

Title = {Adapting team-based learning for application in telecommunications
   engineering using software-defined radio},

Abstract = {One of the great challenges of engineering education is bringing theory
   closer to practical applications. The team-based learning methodology,
   which uses the flipped classroom concept, is actively centred on the
   student. The students study a conceptual material independently before
   it is covered in the classroom. After that, they spend a considerable
   amount of time working in groups in the classroom solving problems with
   conceptual application of the material studied. The last stage of
   team-based learning is the application of course concepts. However, in
   the telecommunications field, the high cost of equipment for practical
   development in educational institutions is a big barrier. Moreover, the
   equipment used is traditionally dedicated to a single activity. In order
   to solve this problem and apply all the team-based learning stages in
   telecommunications engineering teaching, this paper presents a proposal
   of an adaptation of this methodology using a software-defined radio set
   using the universal software radio peripheral hardware and the GNU Radio
   software. This set offers flexible functionalities and low cost.
   Finally, we show the proposal for each team-based learning stage in the
   learning process of the amplitude modulator and demodulator - double
   sideband suppressed carrier relating concepts to practical applications.},

Abstract = {With the in-depth development of data mining technology and quality
   education, the teaching of PE public curriculum in colleges and
   universities has become an important component in the comprehensive
   cultivation of students' ability and quality. However, there are many
   problems in the PE public curriculum in colleges and universities in
   China. For example, the teaching contents are outdated; the physical
   education teaching method is single; and it is difficult to satisfy the
   individualized needs of students. As the most popular courses on the
   Internet in recent years, MOOC has broken the fixed study time and place
   so that students can arrange the learning content and plan according to
   their own interests. This can truly realize the personalized education
   and open up the new mode of PE public curriculum in colleges and
   universities. Therefore, the paper takes data mining technology and MOOC
   teaching mode as the basis of theoretical research, makes a reasonable
   evaluation of the traditional teaching mode of colleges and universities
   and then establishes the flipped classroom and hybrid teaching mode of
   PE public curriculum in colleges and universities under the MOOC
   teaching mode. Finally, the specific implementation of the MOOC teaching
   mode is given.},

Abstract = {Five colleges and universities in Upstate New York, United States,
   created the Route-90 Collaborative' to support faculty implementing the
   Institute of Medicine's (IOM) Framework for Educating Health
   Professionals to Address the Social Determinants of Health. The two
   courses described herein used a flipped classroom approach in which
   students from 14 different nations were responsible for facilitating
   individual classes. This descriptive study used an educational
   intervention in two interprofessional courses - reproductive health and
   global health - based on the IOM Framework into two courses. The
   evaluation used quantitative and open-ended text response data from
   students. Course evaluations indicated the students found the courses
   helped them to learn more about health issues and service delivery in
   various countries, expand their knowledge base on sociocultural and
   ecological influences on health care, and broaden their perspectives on
   various health topics so they will be able to provide higher quality
   healthcare. Although this is the first effort of our Collaborative to
   implement the Framework, given the student feedback, we believe
   implementing the Framework in various courses has the potential to
   enhance healthcare service delivery and reduce the negative impact of
   social determinants of health.},

Abstract = {This investigation explores student teachers' perceptions of and
   performance using flipped classroom pedagogy (FCP) as a teaching
   approach in a teacher education course at an Open Distance eLearning
   university. An explanatory mixed methods design was used, and a pre-test
   and post-test online survey and Economics blog postings were employed to
   collect data for the study. Only postgraduate certificate of education
   and bachelor of education (B.Ed.: senior and further education and
   training phase) student teachers (n = 371) were purposively selected. It
   is reported that the FCP group outperformed the direct instruction group
   in the final examination scores. The results confirmed earlier studies
   that the FCP method enhanced the performance and perceptions of
   Economics students in an online open distance-learning environment in
   comparison with the direct instruction method. Furthermore, FCP
   encouraged an engaging atmosphere and fostered a collaborative,
   interactive synergy among student teachers. Finally, the findings
   revealed that the role of the teacher in the FCP design is crucial for
   promoting optimal learning experiences for student teachers. Several
   implications for using the FCP approach as a driver for an alternative
   assessment strategy at institutions of higher education, and for teacher
   education programmes in particular, emerged.},

Title = {Does a novel teaching approach work? A Students' perspective},
Journal = {NURSE EDUCATION TODAY},
Year = {2020},
Volume = {85},
Month = {FEB},
Abstract = {Background: There is always a call for educational reform and further
   research to improve educational programs. The continuous development of
   new educational approaches is a work in progress. Educational strategies
   like team-based learning, flipped classroom, and lottery-based token
   economy, were used to develop a novel teaching approach.
   Aim: This study had two major goals. The first goal was to introduce a
   novel teaching approach in professional healthcare academies. The second
   goal was to get an in-depth understanding, from the students'
   perspective, about the benefits and limitations of this new teaching
   approach.
   Method: The study was conducted using a qualitative, phenomenological
   research design. Third and fourth-year nursing students completed
   reflective journals to describe their personal experience with the new
   teaching approach at the end of the semester. The students' responses
   were analyzed and coded using Kember's four-category coding schema for
   reflective writing, to extract themes using thematic analysis.
   Findings: Seventy-five students completed and returned their reflective
   journals. The analysis showed various challenges and
   facilitators/benefits of the students' experiences. The themes that
   emerged from the analysis were: lack of exposure vs. a sense of
   achievement; lack of teamwork skills vs. role fulfillment; working with
   new people vs. conflict resolution; variation vs.
   collaboration/creativity; time management vs. constructive competition;
   wasting resources vs. flexibility, and proactivity/active engagement.
   These themes summarized why the new teaching approach worked and what
   barriers students faced with the new assembly.
   Conclusion: Results from the current study demonstrated the great
   potential of the new teaching approach. Recommendations for future
   research were also discussed.},

Title = {Online education action for defeating COVID-19 in China: An analysis of
   the system, mechanism and mode},
Journal = {EDUCATIONAL PHILOSOPHY AND THEORY},
Abstract = {This study explores the online education action for defeating COVID-19
   in China from the perspectives of the system, mechanism and mode. In
   particular, the policy development of online education in China during
   the epidemic includes the education informatization policy, the online
   education system, and the online education mechanism in China. The
   online education and teaching mode during the epidemic involve the
   synchronous live class-based teaching mode, asynchronous recording and
   broadcasting teaching mode, online flipped classroom teaching mode, and
   online tutoring-based teaching mode. Both characteristics and trends of
   online education in China during the epidemic have been explored in this
   study. In addition, the problems, discussions and remarks are also
   offered.},

Abstract = {This article describes one approach to flipping an introductory
   sociology course. To encourage students to practice `doing' sociology,
   we designed a flipped classroom that included a `pay to play' model,
   small group work and an emphasis on active learning during class time.
   With this course design, we linked in-class active learning with outside
   prework so that students could engage with critical sociological
   concepts and apply those concepts in practice. With this flipped design,
   the instructors observed that students were deeply engaged with the
   course topics and expressed positive perceptions of their learning and
   growth over the semester. As the landscape of university instruction
   shifts, this course design model may assist instructors looking to
   foster active and engaged learning remotely.},

Abstract = {The present study reviewed the papers in the Scopus database relevant to
   flipped classrooms in all mathematics subject areas published up until
   2018 from various dimensions. It was found that there has been a
   considerable number of studies on flipped classrooms in mathematics
   education in these years. The majority were conducted in university
   courses, such as applied mathematics, discrete mathematics/algebra, and
   analysis. Most of the researchers adopted quantitative methods. In the
   before-class stage of the mathematics flipped classroom, a number of
   studies employed online learning systems or social media to provide
   instructional videos and to carry out online discussion. As for the
   in-class stage, the most frequently adopted learning strategies were
   issue discussion, exercise, and problem-based learning, while only a few
   studies used technologies in this stage. The majority of studies
   investigated students' learning achievement, motivation, satisfaction,
   and collaboration and communication awareness. Most studies administered
   examinations to evaluate the students' learning achievement. It is worth
   noting that little or no research was found to explore students'
   cognitive load. Accordingly, several suggestions for applying flipped
   classrooms to mathematics education as well as potential issues for
   future research are proposed in this study.

Abstract = {To develop collaborative competencies of future health and social
   services professionals, the Universite de Montreal (UdeM) offers
   interprofessional education (IPE) in partnership with patients. To meet
   the challenges of IPE, UdeM turned to digital tools to enable
   interprofessional teams of students to collaborate online and
   face-to-face. The collaborative flipped classroom for IPE with patient
   partnership is the conceptual framework for the pedagogical method used
   for this study. It is based on: 1) a competency framework and 2)
   collaborative learning concept and dimensions. The study aimed to: 1)
   demonstrate how interprofessional teams of students mobilize framework
   competencies and care approaches during online and face-to-face
   collaborative learning activities; and 2) analyze how students
   collaborate during a hybrid IPE course using a patient partnership
   approach. Using a qualitative methodology, the contents of the online
   collaborative journals (OCJs) of 12 interprofessional student teams were
   analyzed, along with the individual comments (n = 994) of IPE course
   learners collected through the Interprofessional Team Collaboration
   questionnaire (n = 321). The results suggest that the course under study
   enabled teams to collaborate online and face-to-face throughout the
   term, and indicate that students were better prepared to adopt a patient
   partnership approach.},

Abstract = {This paper reports the co-creation process carried out during the
   development of a web-based visual representation model for authoring
   blended learning designs. The results of several participatory design
   workshops with high school teachers of two school communities have
   allowed to advance the development process through iterative cycles of
   refinement and improvement. The authoring tool resulting from the
   co-creation process supports teachers in the planning and visualization
   of complex blended learning scenarios (including hybrid massive online
   courses, flipped classroom and problem-based learning designs). Our
   experience contributes to the research community with a case study on
   using co-creation in technology-enhanced learning, where we discuss the
   challenges and opportunities found during the implementation process of
   this collaborative and participatory approach.},

Abstract = {BackgroundEducational changes often face resistance as lecturers tend to
   stand by familiar methods of instruction. This reluctance presents a
   challenge for programme coordinators who wish to introduce other
   methods, such as flipped classrooms, and seek to motivate lecturers to
   embrace educational change. Research into lecturers' motivational
   strategies during educational change is evident in the setting of adult
   education but outnumbered by studies on student motivation in the
   context of higher education.PurposeThis study looks into what leads
   adult education teachers to integrate flipped classrooms and seeks to
   cultivate change management principles to facilitate flipped classroom
   adoption. We integrate change and self-determination theory to draw and
   test a conceptual model that allows educational change managers to make
   lecturers feel related to their institution, competent to flip their
   classroom and autonomous in deciding how to apply flipped
   instruction.Design and methodsThis study employed a phenomenological
   design to explore how lecturers experience the impact of change
   management principles on their relatedness, competence and autonomy when
   flipping their classrooms. We conducted semi-structured interviews with
   eleven lecturers at three Flemish adult education centres. Qualitative
   interview data were deductively and inductively analysed, validating the
   literature-based framework while allowing additional insights to emerge
   from participants' experiences.Results and conclusionsOur findings
   suggest that it would be beneficial to appoint a guiding coalition' that
   addresses lecturers' need for relatedness. This would be a way of
   acknowledging change efforts and facilitating periodic peer exchanges
   that eliminate fear of interference in colleagues' teaching practices.
   Both the need for customised training materials and emotional support,
   in case of technical failure, were perceived important in achieving
   competence. Lecturers' need for autonomy represents a balancing act
   between top-down change communication and inviting lecturers to
   co-decide on the pace and level of flipped classroom adoption. We
   suggest that lecturers' instructional practices (i.e. routines) have the
   potential for propagating flipped instruction from the bottom-up.},

Abstract = {Historically, the introductory course in statistics at the Norwegian
   University of Life Sciences (NMBU), has taken a traditional,
   lecture-based form. A previous study at the NMBU concluded that the
   course structure appeared to disfavor certain cognitive or personality
   types, extraverts in particular. Therefore, in 2016, as an experiment,
   the course was restructured into a student active learning course
   following a flipped classroom approach. At the same time, students were
   encouraged to do an online screening test for cognitive preferences,
   personality, work interest, and preferred learning style. The main
   outcome in the present study was exam scores. Despite the new course
   structure, we still found significant differences in exam scores between
   students with a contextual preference, compared with a digital
   preference, and those with a feeling-based rather than a thinking-based
   personality characteristic. However, in contrast to the previous study,
   no significant difference in exam scores was found between the
   extraverts and the introverts, also after adjusting for other
   covariates. In the present article, we outline these results and other
   findings that indicate that additional adaptations should be made in the
   course, in order to reach an even wider group of the heterogeneous
   student mass, helping individuals to better reach their learning
   potential.},

Title = {Applying behavioural activation (BA) and simulation-based learning (SBL)
   approaches to enhance MSW students' competence in suicide risk
   assessment, prevention, and intervention (SRAPI)},
Journal = {SOCIAL WORK EDUCATION},
Abstract = {Providing adequate training on suicide assessment and intervention for
   students is of utmost importance in social work education. Given
   students' anxiety around working with clients who have potential risk of
   suicide, scholars underline the benefits of experiential learning to
   enhance competence in MSW students in suicide risk assessment,
   prevention, and intervention (SRAPI). This paper illustrates how a
   required advanced mental health practice course has utilized
   simulation-based learning (SBL) and behavioural activation (BA) to
   foster specific skill building in SRAPI. Using a flipped classroom
   approach permitted students to increase knowledge related to suicide and
   BA using a self-guided online format. They also had opportunities to
   apply the online learning to classroom learning through practice
   activities. SBL was an innovative pedagogical approach that was critical
   for SRAPI training as it provides students with opportunities to engage
   in simulated practice with no harm to real clients. Using BA, students
   learned to conduct detailed functional analysis of suicide risks with
   corresponding graded tasks to mitigate suicidal risk. This paper
   discusses lessons learned from the SRAPI training and makes suggestions
   for future research and educational policies in social work education.},

Abstract = {This article focuses on the unique contribution of the QT-clicker
   regarding formative and summative assessment in a large flipped first
   year statistics module. In this module, the flipped classroom as
   pedagogical model first substituted the traditional teaching model.
   QT-clickers were subsequently introduced to enable active and
   cooperative learning for face-to-face engagement inside the classroom.
   The various input capabilities of the QT-clicker, providing for the
   possibility of partial grade crediting, offer a distinguishing
   advantage. These clickers were initially only used for formative
   assessment, but soon extended to summative assessment. Two cohorts-2014
   (no QT-clickers) and 2017 (with QT-clickers)-were compared. The
   intervention of using QT-clickers was evaluated along two lines: the
   pedagogical influence of the QT-clicker and the effect of partial grade
   crediting. Several general linear models (GLMs) were fitted to the data
   to investigate how QT-clicker use is related to the students'
   examination performance. The outcome of the GLM models indicates that
   the association of higher examination marks with QT-clicker use holds
   for the 2017 cohort with and without partial credit. A qualitative
   component of the study reports on the student voice testifying to
   positive experience.},

Title = {Digital Workbooks in Flipped Nutrition Education: Student Perspectives'},
Journal = {EDUCATION SCIENCES},
Year = {2020},

Number = {1},
Month = {JAN},
Abstract = {Nutrition and dietetic (N\&D) education is traditionally taught
   didactically; however, the flipped classroom approach (FCA) is an
   emerging pedagogical approach in this discipline. Technological tools
   providing cognitive support enhance learning, particularly when students
   are engaged. In N\&D education, students have reported the FCA as
   engaging; however, evidence for how best to integrate technologies into
   the FCA is limited. The aim of this research is to explore undergraduate
   nutrition and dietetic students' self-reported perceptions of the use of
   a digital workbook in nutrition courses designed and delivered using an
   FCA. A cross-sectional self-administered online survey was utilised to
   investigate Australian undergraduate student (N = 39) satisfaction,
   frequency of use, engagement with, and usefulness of a digital workbook.
   Most students (87\%) were satisfied/very satisfied with the digital
   workbook as a tool for learning, applying and consolidating/revising
   course content. Most students (95\%) agreed the digital workbook was
   engaging, providing comments related to workbook design, encouraged
   participation and novelty. Most useful aspects reported were workbook
   structure, development of a learning artefact, self-directed aspects and
   convenience, whereas, least useful aspects included technological
   issues. The use of a digital workbook in N\&D education was well
   received and is an innovative approach to delivering courses taught with
   an FCA.},

Abstract = {Purpose The purpose of this paper is to suggest a methodology for
   evaluating the effectiveness of the flipped classroom (FC) model over
   traditional lecture-based teaching. It also proposed a tool to measure
   students' perception toward the flipped approach in context of Indian
   management education. Design/methodology/approach This study employs an
   experimental research design to assess the effectiveness of the FC
   pedagogy over traditional teaching methods. Both qualitative and
   quantitative research methods are used in order to judge student
   engagement, content understanding, students' perception and student
   academic performance. Experimental research design, along with survey
   research, is implemented in order to judge the students' perception
   toward FCs. Findings The study proposes a six-dimensional tool to
   measure learning in an FC setting. These dimensions are as follows:
   students' in-class involvement, comprehensive content understanding,
   students' academic performance, students' cognitive capabilities,
   collaborative learning environment and students' inclination toward
   teaching and learning process. Results of this research are promising
   and encouraging toward the adoption of the FC model.
   Originality/value The research demonstrates the successful
   implementation of qualitative and quantitative research techniques to
   evaluate the effectiveness of FC model in context of management
   education in India.},

Abstract = {The flipped classroom pedagogy was implemented in two core undergraduate
   science courses; Animal and Plant Biochemistry II (APB) and Microbiology
   and Invertebrate Biology II (MIB) to encourage students to prepare for
   laboratory classes. Students often attend class without little
   understanding or appreciation of what they are going to learn in the
   laboratory, the types of techniques they are going to use or the safety
   precautions required. This is not only hazardous for students but also
   requires detailed explanations from teaching staff at the start of
   class, overloading students with information. This disconnection between
   theory and practice was overcome by `flipping the laboratory' to
   integrate online, interactive pre-laboratory activities into the
   curriculum. The aims of this study were to: (1) evaluate student
   engagement with pre-laboratory content; (2) investigate student
   performance and learning outcomes; (3) review failure rates following
   implementation of pre-laboratory activities. Students agreed that the
   pre-laboratory activities bridged the gap between theory and practice
   (65\%) and enhanced their engagement with course material (79\%). The
   integration of pre-laboratory activities significantly increased student
   learning outcomes immediately after implementation into the curriculum,
   despite a 26.8\% increase in enrolments from 2011 to 2017. Failure rates
   significantly decreased in both APB and MIB over three consecutive
   years.},

   (Silverstein, N. M., \& Fitzgerald, K. G. (2017). Educating a new
   generation of professionals in agingworldwide. Gerontology \& Geriatrics
   Education, 38, 1-4) has lead for a call by gerontology educators to
   employ creative, innovative, novel, and engaging pedagogy in

   outlines a novel approach to teaching-combining the flipped classroom
   with project-based learning-that not only fosters deep learning but also
   fosters the development of skills applicable to real life. This article
   describes how to turn traditional lectures into online lectures to
   ``flip{''} the classroom and also provides a guide for setting up
   project-based learning, providing suggestions for group formation,
   project topics, and examples of project contracts and evaluation sheets.
   When employed together, these powerful teaching tools can provide
   students with an active, participatory, class experience with the
   potential to inspire a lifelong interest in adult development and
   gerontology.},

Title = {Student perceptions of technological tools for flipped instruction: The
   case of Padlet, Kahoot! and Cirrus},

Abstract = {Technological tools used in teaching and learning have been reported to
   influence their satisfaction, engagement and their continued effort in
   learning (Roach, 2014). The present study, therefore, investigated
   students' perceptions of technological use in a flipped classroom at
   university level through evaluation of three different web-based tools,
   using the lens of the Technology Acceptance Model (TAM) (Davis, 1989;
   Venkatesh \& Davis, 2000). These tools include a collaborative canvas
   tool (Padlet), a live polling platform (Kahoot!) and an annotation tool
   (Cirrus). Results from focus group interviews show that most of the
   students had positive perceptions of the three technological tools
   targeted in this study. Nevertheless, using the TAM model that draws on
   two indexes, namely usefulness and perceived ease of use, the findings
   revealed students' mixed perceptions towards the three tools.
   Particularly, Padlet was perceived to be useful for both independent and
   colloborative learning, but less easy to use when there was too much
   content. Kahoot! was considered the most useful and easy to use for
   revision of learnt concepts. Finally, Cirrus was easy to use, but less
   useful for creative tasks. The results are discussed in terms of the
   role of technological tools in flipped learning, and implications for
   technologically enhanced flipped instruction are suggested.},

Abstract = {Animation is increasingly incorporated into multimedia teaching tools in
   medical education. Despite enthusiasm about animation among learners and
   educators, evidence is limited and conflicting regarding the
   effectiveness of animation in medical education. In this how-to guide
   and pilot study, a team of clinician-educators have cataloged their
   efforts to learn the art of animation and understand how to most
   effectively integrate animation into a flipped classroom curriculum. In
   this pilot, internal medicine residents responded that an animated video
   series using anthropomorphic characters and metaphorical dialogue and
   narrative was an accessible, acceptable, and effective method of
   teaching the antihyperglycemic medications for type 2 diabetes mellitus.
   This study paves a path for further exploration of the intersection
   between multimedia, entertainment, and cognitive theory in graduate
   medical education.},

Abstract = {This article describes how teaching in a second-year undergraduate
   stylistics workshop was transformed in my attempt to increase student
   attendance and engagement, and the strategies that were put in place to
   achieve this outcome. The personal account describes how I changed my
   teaching pedagogy to facilitate learning through collaborative
   strategies and how I evaluated the impact this had on student learning
   using action research (Bradbury, 2015 (ed) The SAGE Handbook of Action
   Research. London: SAGE) as the investigative approach. Using the model
   of Plan-Act-Observe-Reflect process (Kemmis and McTaggart, 1988 The
   Action Research Planner. 3rd edn. Geelong: Deakin University Press) and
   with data from a short questionnaire given to students, I was able to
   gain a deeper understanding of the value of the activities as perceived
   by students. The flipped classroom, where materials were given to
   students in advance to prepare, became critical for participation in the
   workshop and allowed for classroom time to be optimised for discussion
   and feedback. This article also presents photographs of the stylistic
   analysis produced on whiteboards as part of the collaborative activities
   with a summary of responses by students to the questionnaire which
   evaluated the impact that this approach to teaching had on their
   learning, confidence and preparation for the assessment.},

Title = {Using automatic speech recognition technology to enhance EFL learners'
   oral language complexity in a flipped classroom},
Journal = {AUSTRALASIAN JOURNAL OF EDUCATIONAL TECHNOLOGY},
Year = {2021},
Volume = {37},
Number = {2, SI},
Pages = {110-131},
Abstract = {The present study examined the effects of using automatic speech
   recognition (ASR) technology on oral complexity in a flipped English as
   a Foreign Language (EFL) course. A total of 160 undergraduates were
   enrolled in a 14-week quasi-experiment. The experimental group (EG) and
   the control group (CG) were taught with a flipped approach, but the EG
   students needed to undertake an additional pre-class task with ASR
   technology. In each unit, all students' in-class task performance was
   recorded, based on which the metrics of oral complexity were coded and
   computed. A two-way between- and within-subjects repeated measures
   design was conducted to examine the effects of the group factor, the
   time factor and the group x time interaction effects. The results showed
   that the EG students performed statistically better than their
   counterparts in the CG on lexical complexity and syntactic complexity.
   Moreover, significant improvement in phrasal complexity was witnessed
   over time in both groups. Significant group x time interaction effects
   were witnessed on overall complexity or subordination complexity. The
   gradients of the EG trajectories of the two metrics were greater than
   those of the CG. However, on phrasal complexity, the interaction effect
   was not significant.
   Implications for practice or policy:
   EFL teachers could integrate ASR technology into pre-class tasks to
   improve students' oral English complexity.
   EFL teachers need to be aware that phrasal complexity may be more
   sensitive to flipped EFL instruction than overall complexity and
   subordination complexity.
   Course developers could integrate ASR technology in fostering EFL
   learners' overall complexity and subordination complexity.},

Abstract = {BACKGROUND: The COVID-19 pandemic presents a unique challenge to
   surgical residency programs. Due to the restrictions recommended by the
   Centers for Disease Control and Prevention and other organizations, the
   educational landscape for surgical residents is rapidly changing. In
   addition, the time course of these changes is undefined.
   METHODS: We attempt to define the scope of the problem of maintaining
   surgical resident education while maintaining the safety of residents,
   educators, and patients. Within the basic framework of limiting
   in-person gatherings, postponing or canceling elective operations in
   hospitals, and limiting rotations between sites, we propose innovative
   solutions to maintain rigorous education.
   RESULTS: We propose several innovative solutions including the flipped
   classroom model, online practice questions, teleconferencing in place of
   in-person lectures, involving residents in telemedicine clinics,
   procedural simulation, and the facilitated use of surgical videos.
   Although there is no substitute for hands-on learning through operative
   experience and direct patient care, these may be ways to mitigate the
   loss of learning exposure during this time.
   CONCLUSIONS: These innovative solutions utilizing technology may help to
   bridge the educational gap for surgical residents during this
   unprecedented circumstance. The support of national organizations may be
   beneficial in maintaining rigorous surgical education. Published by
   Elsevier Inc. on behalf of Association of Program Directors in Surgery.},

Abstract = {The Flipped Classroom Model (FC) can be considered as a meta-strategy
   that can provide an available structure in order to introduce the new
   methodologies in the classroom. The aim of this study is to analyze the
   level of digital competence of Spanish teachers and to determine if they
   are technically prepared to design and implement the model. For this, we
   used two tools. A survey designed according to the recommended
   dimensions of the ``Common Framework for Digital Competence of
   Teachers{''} of the Digital Culture in School Plan (ACDC questionnaire).
   A questionnaire that we carried out among more than 100 Spanish experts
   in Flipped learning to determine, through analysis of the ACDC
   questionnaire, which would be the 12 key competences for the adequate
   development of the FC model. This second analysis will help us determine
   the technical specificities required by the FC model, which can guide
   the teachers in evaluating their own competences and in building a
   formative itinerary over FC and ICTs. The Spanish teachers have a low or
   medium-low level in many of the keys kills to include these strategies
   in their professional performance. A plan of improvement of digital
   skills is needed to alleviate the detected weaknesses.},

Abstract = {Gamification is an innovative pedagogical strategy where digital games
   are used in an educational setting and as an aid to learning. Recent
   publications on gamification in the classroom investigate the concept of
   meaningful gamification, where, in line with Ryan and Deci's
   self-determination theory, competency, autonomy, and relatedness are
   prioritized. The paradigm of meaningful gamification works well as a
   catalyst in motivating students to read background material and grasp
   key concepts that facilitate a flipped classroom. This study measures
   the impact of meaningful gaming on students' motivation in a higher
   education setting. The context for this study is the module Women in
   Film, which is part of the Ideas and Exposition Programme at the Centre
   for English Language Communication, National University of Singapore.},

Title = {Virtual teaching of undergraduate primary care small groups during

Abstract = {The impact of the COVID-19 pandemic required Higher Educational
   Institutions to redesign and implement new ways of delivering
   core-learning outcomes for medical students. Much of this change
   resulted in a transition to virtual teaching across medical schools.
   Medical education in primary care is often delivered as part of
   GP-facilitated small group teaching and with this came unique challenges
   for the transition to online education.
   Transition to virtual small group teaching utilised blended learning and
   flipped classroom methodologies alongside the use of virtual teaching
   platforms. This quality improvement project describes the educational
   approaches used when transitioning medical education, and compares
   student experience from receiving small group teaching using
   face-to-face and virtual teaching methods before and during the COVID-19
   pandemic, respectively. Analysis of student feedback found an ongoing
   delivery of high-quality primary care education using virtual small
   group teaching, and that there was no attrition in student experience
   when compared to face-to-face teaching delivered before COVID-19 for the
   same learning outcomes.
   These findings are reassuring and suggest that the transition to virtual
   small group teaching, using methods such as flipped classrooms and
   blended learning, enables continued and sustained delivery of
   high-quality education and student experiences in primary care.},

Title = {Qualitative Analysis of a Cultural Dexterity Program for Surgeons:
   Feasible, Impactful, and Necessary},

Abstract = {OBJECTIVES: Ineffective cross-cultural communication contributes to
   adverse outcomes for minority patients. To address this, the authors
   developed a novel curriculum for surgical residents built on the
   principle of cultural dexterity, emphasizing adaptability to clinical
   and sociocultural circumstances to tailor care to the needs of the
   individual patient. This study's objective was to evaluate the
   feasibility, acceptability, and perception of this program upon
   conclusion of its first year.
   DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS: The curriculum was implemented at 3
   general surgery programs. The flipped classroom model combined
   independent study via e-learning modules with interactive role-playing
   sessions. Sessions took place over 1 academic year. Four focus groups
   were held, each with 6 to 9 participants, to gain feedback on the
   curriculum. Focus groups were recorded and transcribed, and the data
   were analyzed using a grounded theory approach.
   RESULTS: Five major themes emerged: (1) Role modeling from senior
   colleagues is integral in developing communication/interpersonal skills
   and attitudes toward cultural dexterity. (2) Cultural dexterity is
   relevant to the provision of high-quality surgical care. (3) Barriers to
   providing culturally dexterous care exist at the system level. (4)
   ``Buy-in{''} at all levels of the institution is necessary to implement
   the principles of cultural dexterity. (5) The shared experience of
   discussing the challenges and triumphs of caring for a diverse
   population was engaging and impactful.
   CONCLUSION: Early implementation of the curriculum revealed that the
   tension between surgical residents' desire to improve their cultural
   dexterity and systemic/practical obstacles can be resolved. Combining
   surgically relevant didactic materials with experiential learning
   activities can change the paradigm of cross-cultural training. (C) 2018

Abstract = {This ethnographic study of a beginning-level German course at an
   Australian university examined the student experience of learning second
   language (L2) grammar in a flipped classroom. Students accessed explicit
   grammar instruction and completed grammar exercises prior to attending
   face-to-face classes; during class, the structures were briefly reviewed
   by the students and then applied in interactive task-based activities
   focused on meaningful use of the L2. In surveys and interviews, learners
   reported that the opportunity to manage the pace and depth of their
   interaction with online grammar modules facilitated their learning and
   increased their confidence. Linking these outcomes to research that has
   shown that flipped teaching models reduce or assist in the management of
   cognitive load, the study presents a compelling case for flipping the L2
   classroom.},

Abstract = {Conventional, teacher-centred classroom activities are prominent in
   Vietnam where educators are familiar with a one-way flow of information
   and using limited resources for their practice, whilst a culture of
   creativity in the classroom is often ignored. Vietnamese educators face
   a huge challenge, motivating passive learners to be more creative and
   active learners as society responds to rapid changes in technologies.
   This article suggests that a flipping structure that incorporates a
   design thinking approach paves the way for course designers to assist
   passive learners to become more active in their learning processes. An
   undergraduate course was redesigned and delivered in a flipped classroom
   design, aiming at nurturing active learning among students. Quantitative
   findings highlighted that there was an improvement in student's
   engagement, including intellectual engagement and attendance, and that
   overall student satisfaction improved.},

Abstract = {The students' engagement was deemed significant to research due to the
   changing study structures from course-based to student-centered and
   competence-based in sustainable science higher education. Still, its
   change and coping strategies is considered as somewhat unfamiliar
   learning environment. Research examined students' engagement to the
   learning approach of a flipped-classroom model for sustainable science
   course with the Revised Two-Factor Study Process Questionnaire
   (R-SPQ-2F). It assesses research proposals, which students are utilizing
   to learning, and engagement and individual abilities as well. The
   research was conducted with the students enrolled in the `Atmospheric
   Pollution{''} course of the Environmental Science undergraduate program
   (n=64). The results obtained through the R-SPQ-2F showed the students'
   number reaching higher ``deep approach{''} in their learning increased
   at the course end while it can be observed that the students' number
   marking ``surface approach{''} below the mean value was slightly lower
   (pre- and post-test comparison). It can be concluded that students are
   employing more engagement in their works and enhancing their personal
   skills as well with the teaching methodology. Results obviously
   specified that the study structure change was a phase into correct
   emphasis to improve students' engagement in the flipped sustainable
   science education.},

Abstract = {Due to the learning difficulties in mathematics education, a new
   teaching methodology have been proposed for its improvement.
   Difficulties in mathematics learning indicate that students are not able
   to properly deal with resolving calculations and/or problems. This
   research examines the evolution of the attitudes of pre-service
   teachers' (PSTs) toward mathematics learning when an open calculation
   based on numbers (OCN) method was followed in a flipped classroom. It
   was conducted in a general mathematics course, Primary Education
   bachelor's degree during the course of 2019/2020. A total of 143
   students participated in the study (230 students enrolled), with a pre-
   and post-test survey questionnaire. Based on the analysis of survey
   questionnaires, the obtained results demonstrated that the attitudes
   (own beliefs and conceptions (OB), positive (ATP), and negative (ATN)
   attitudes) of PSTs improved positively after completing the flipped-OCN
   method toward mathematics learning. Regarding the statistical analyses,
   all questions had a significant difference that showed the influence of
   the flipped-OCN method, improving the PSTs attitudes toward mathematics
   learning (p < 0.005). According to the structural equation
   modeling-partial least squares (SEM-PLS) analysis, it demonstrated that
   the components relation effects of OB, ATP, and ATN of PSTs toward
   mathematics learning, and the influence of their educational background.
   Finally, with the principal component analysis (PCA), it can be found
   out that the science and technology background were positively
   correlated after the flipped-OCN method comparing with the rest of PSTs.
   The influence of the proposed method indicated a significant improvement
   in these components. Therefore, the results concluded that this study
   allowed to draw a promising tendency about the PSTs' attitudes toward
   mathematics learning with the OCN method in the flipped classroom.
   Additionally, these outcomes could advance our comprehension of how to
   help pre-service education for teachers' enhancement and maturity of
   positive attitudes about themselves as future teachers. Then, it would
   be a fundamental piece in building logical and critical thinking and
   development for children.},

Abstract = {Today, educators seek to meet the needs of students during the Covid-19
   pandemic through the incorporation of Information and Communication
   Technologies (ICTs) in the teaching-learning process. The aim of this
   quantitative research is to analyze the perception of educators about
   the impact of technology and web platforms in the educational field
   through machine learning (linear regression). The sample is made up of
   58 educators from the National Autonomous University of Mexico. The
   results of machine learning indicate that web platforms positively
   influence the performance of school activities through the use of mobile
   devices and flipped classroom. Likewise, web platforms positively
   influence the teaching process. Finally, educators use technological
   advances in the educational context to transform the school activities
   under the distance mode and update the courses in the times of Covid-19.},

Title = {Flipping the Classroom to Optimize Clinical Decision-Making in the
   Didactic Setting},
Journal = {JOURNAL OF DOCTORAL NURSING PRACTICE},

Abstract = {Background: Deliberate inclusion of clinical decision-making nursing
   skills in the didactic setting will assist students in potentially
   making better patient care decisions. This can be optimized through use
   of the flipped learning andragogy. Flipped learning promotes an
   interactive classroom environment. It fosters teamwork and
   collaboration. Direct content instruction is the responsibility of
   students. Objective: This cohort pilot study investigated how the
   flipped and nonflipped approach to teaching impacted clinical
   decision-making and student participation. Methods: The Clinical
   Decision-Making in Nursing Scale (CDMNS) was administered to the
   students in the flipped classroom and the nonflipped classroom on week 1
   and week 6. A student participation checklist was used to observe class
   activities at three separate intervals (baseline, mid-semester, and
   end-semester). A repeated measures analysis of covariance was conducted
   with Instruction Group as the between subjects factor (Flipped and
   Nonflipped) and Time (preinstruction and postinstruction) as the within
   subjects factor, and covarying age. The Time by the Instruction group
   was significant. The Flipped group showed an increase in Clinical
   decision-making scores (p < .001) after instruction while the Nonflipped
   group did not (p = .40). Results: The Flipped group (n = 24) showed an
   increase in Clinical decision-making scores (p < .001) after instruction
   while the Nonflipped group (n = 23) did not (p = .40). The Flipped
   classroom showed 100\% participation at baseline, mid-semester, and end
   of semester. The Nonflipped classroom showed overall lower levels of
   participation, with 42\%, 33\%, and 39\% at each point respectively.
   Conclusion/Implications for Nursing: Students who were taught using the
   flipped instruction were able to apply what they learned in relevant
   case studies, virtual simulations, and practice National Council
   Licensure Examination RN (NCLEX-RN) type questions. Through teamwork and
   collaboration, students had time to practice clinical decision-making
   skills. This was evident in the increased CDMNS scores and increased
   levels of participation over time in the flipped group when compared to
   the nonflipped group.},

Abstract = {As instructors seek ways to increase student engagement and retention,
   several innovative pedagogical approaches have been developed that
   fosters critical thinking and quality group work. One of these
   approaches is Team-Based Learning (TBL), a flipped-classroom model that
   has been found to improve student outcomes and knowledge retention.
   While prior research has found students tend to have positive
   perceptions of TBL, these have been limited to other disciplines. The
   current study sought to examine how students perceive the use of TBL in
   two criminal justice courses through pre- and post-test surveys. Results
   indicated that students overall had positive perceptions of TBL as they
   found solving problems in teams to be effective and tended to prefer TBL
   to traditional lecture-based courses. Implications and future directions
   are also discussed.},

Abstract = {Many STEM (science, technology, engineering, and mathematics)
   disciplines require a two-semester sequence of introductory college
   chemistry, which are thus critical gateway courses to a variety of
   majors. Recognizing the benefit to educators of a structure of content
   learning across the chemistry curriculum, in 2012, the American Chemical
   Society (ACS) developed the Anchoring Concepts Content Map, or ACCM. The
   development and subsequent revision of the general chemistry ACCM
   inspired the restructuring of our first-year chemistry sequence. Thus
   our CHEM 1001 and 1002 courses, taught in an atoms-first framework, were
   reorganized into a set of nine modules, each intentionally linked to one
   (or more) anchoring concept of the ACCM. In this initial effort, we have
   developed the course modules and subtopics and a set of learning
   objectives for each module and linked these to the general chemistry
   ACCM. To facilitate the initial teaching of the courses, the redesign
   occurred during the academic year, and the courses were taught in summer
   term 2019 using a flipped classroom design with three weekly 100 min
   face-to-face discussion meetings and two weekly laboratories for the 6
   week long courses. Herein we describe the course design and its mapping
   onto the ACCM and discuss the results of the initial implementation,
   with suggestions given for future adaptations.},

Abstract = {This article presents a STEAM project, ``Sustainable City{''}, based on
   educational robotics whose objective is to bring the problems of climate
   change closer to primary school students. The participants were 30
   students (aged 10-11) from 5th year of Primary Education and the project
   consisted of 14 sessions in which different active methodologies such as
   project-based learning, collaborative learning and the flipped classroom
   were carried out. A pre-test and a post-test were carried out and the
   results were better in the post-test, which indicates that the students
   improved their skills and increased their motivation. As a conclusion,
   this STEAM project, which is adapted to the Spanish LOMCE curriculum,
   can be a reference for other teachers to bring their students closer to
   the problem of environmental change through educational robotics and the
   use of active methodologies.},

Abstract = {This study compares four learning environments: face-to-face learning
   (F2F), fully e-learning (EL), blended learning (BL), and flipped
   classroom (FC) with respect to students' learning performance. Moreover,
   this present research studies changes in perceived flexibility,
   intrinsic motivation, self-efficacy beliefs of students, and the
   interaction effects in these student variables on learning performance.
   Two learning environment design elements: (1) lectures (2) group
   discussions building on guiding questions, were manipulated to create
   the four learning environments. Third-year undergraduate students (n =
   106), enrolled in the ``Animal and Human Physiology{''} course at CanTho
   University (Vietnam), were randomly assigned to one of the four learning
   environments. The results suggest a significant positive differential
   effect on learning performance when studying in a FC and BL setting. No
   significant interaction effects could be observed regarding changes in
   perceived flexibility, intrinsic motivation and self-efficacy. However,
   significant differences between learning conditions were observed in
   perceived flexibility. Analysis of focus group data corroborate the
   finding that students experience more flexibility in time and place when
   studying in FC, BL and EL environments. In addition, students in a FC
   environment reflect significantly larger positive changes in their
   self-efficacy. But, the qualitative data show how positive perceptions
   about flexibility, motivation and self-efficacy are often cancelled out
   by negative perceptions.},

Abstract = {The coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic has altered approaches
   to anesthesiology education by shifting educational paradigms. This
   vision article discusses pre-COVID-19 educational methodologies and best
   evidence, adaptations required under COVID-19, and evidence for these
   modifications, and suggests future directions for anesthesiology
   education. Learning management systems provide structure to online
   learning. They have been increasingly utilized to improve access to
   didactic materials asynchronously. Despite some historic reservations,
   the pandemic has necessitated a rapid uptake across programs.
   Commercially available systems offer a wide range of peer-reviewed
   curricular options. The flipped classroom promotes learning foundational
   knowledge before teaching sessions with a focus on application during
   structured didactics. There is growing evidence that this approach is
   preferred by learners and may increase knowledge gain. The flipped
   classroom works well with learning management systems to disseminate
   focused preclass work. Care must be taken to keep virtual sessions
   interactive. Simulation, already used in anesthesiology, has been
   critical in preparation for the care of COVID-19 patients.
   Multidisciplinary, in situ simulations allow for rapid dissemination of
   new team workflows. Physical distancing and reduced availability of
   providers have required more sessions. Early pandemic decreases in
   operating volumes have allowed for this; future planning will have to
   incorporate smaller groups, sanitizing of equipment, and attention to
   use of personal protective equipment. Effective technical skills
   training requires instruction to mastery levels, use of deliberate
   practice, and high-quality feedback. Reduced sizes of skill-training
   workshops and approaches for feedback that are not in-person will be
   required. Mock oral and objective structured clinical examination (OSCE)
   allow for training and assessment of competencies often not addressed
   otherwise. They provide formative and summative data and objective
   measurements of Accreditation Council for Graduate Medical Education
   (ACGME) milestones. They also allow for preparation for the American
   Board of Anesthesiology (ABA) APPLIED examination. Adaptations to
   teleconferencing or videoconferencing can allow for continued use.
   Benefits of teaching in this new era include enhanced availability of
   asynchronous learning and opportunities to apply universal,
   expert-driven curricula. Burdens include decreased social interactions
   and potential need for an increased amount of smaller, live sessions.
   Acquiring learning management systems and holding more frequent
   simulation and skills sessions with fewer learners may increase cost.
   With the increasing dependency on multimedia and technology support for
   teaching and learning, one important focus of educational research is on
   the development and evaluation of strategies that reduce extraneous
   processing and manage essential and generative processing in virtual
   learning environments. Collaboration to identify and implement best
   practices has the potential to improve education for all learners.},

Abstract = {Active learning strategies with innovative ways are used in the teaching
   and learning for the engagement of students in classroom settings. A
   number of studies talk about the benefits the students have shown while
   using the active learning methods in their science courses, like
   Biochemistry, Anatomy and Physiology, Microbiology and Pathophysiology.
   Active learning helps to retain material, motivate students and to
   develop thinking skills. In the science courses of nursing education,
   these are very much in use for developing critical thinking qualities.
   By applying active learning strategies in science courses of nursing
   education, one may clearly see how the students get engaged with the
   content. Some of these activities are interactive simulations, games,
   small group discussions, videos, blended learning, role-playing, pair
   share, flipped classroom, mini research projects, formative evaluations,
   quizzes, hands-on activities, etc.},

Abstract = {In this paper, a new zeolite/silicone foam for AHP applications was
   evaluated as a case study of a multidisciplinary teaching approach for
   addressing a science education experience from the pedagogical point of
   view. The interdisciplinary approach promotes the improvement of
   scientific knowledge among different materials science disciplines
   allowing to develop a performing adsorbent foamed HEX. In such a
   context, a flipped classroom approach was identified as the most
   suitable method for the students to develop their individual and
   collaborative improvement of knowledge. Changing the classroom lesson
   from teaching to students learning can be an effective strategy for
   stimulating students' interest and learning. This approach, based on a
   5E teaching model, opens up to an active and dynamic discussion phase of
   problem solving which, although contextualized on a practical
   experience, can be effectively extended in wider contexts.},

Title = {Augmented reality for STEM learning: A systematic review},
Journal = {COMPUTERS \& EDUCATION},
Year = {2018},
Volume = {123},
Pages = {109-123},
Month = {AUG},
Abstract = {This study presents a systematic review of the literature on the use of
   augmented reality technology to support science, technology, engineering
   and mathematics (STEM) learning. It synthesizes a set of 28 publications
   from 2010 to 2017. A qualitative content analysis is used to investigate
   the general characteristics of augmented reality applications in STEM
   education, the instructional strategies and techniques deployed in the
   studies reviewed, and the evaluation approaches followed in the
   interventions. This review found that most augmented reality
   applications for STEM learning offered exploration or simulation
   activities. The applications reviewed offered a number of similar design
   features based on digital knowledge discovery mechanisms to consume
   information through the interaction with digital elements. However, few
   studies provided students with assistance in carrying out learning
   activities. Most of the studies reviewed evaluated the effects of
   augmented reality technology in fostering students' conceptual
   understanding, followed by those that investigated affective learning
   outcomes. A number of suggestions for future research arose from this
   review. Researchers need to design features that allow students to
   acquire basic competences related with STEM disciplines, and future
   applications need to include metacognitive scaffolding and experimental
   support for inquiry-based learning activities. Finally, it would be
   useful to explore how augmented reality learning activities can be part
   of blended instructional strategies such as the flipped classroom.},

Abstract = {In first-year engineering students, a common teacher-centred, passive
   learning and deficient secondary educational backgrounds are often
   observed. However, there is a problematic difference whether the
   individual background is vocational education and training (VAT) or
   baccalaureate. This implies an educational need to level up these
   backgrounds, together with a more student-centred, active learning. As a
   possible practical remedy, an approach of independent learning before
   the class was implemented, as in a flipped classroom. To this end,
   students were requested to study the topic scheduled for the next class
   independently as an out-of-class activity or `homework', by using
   sources suggested (handbooks and web pages). At first, this task was not
   monitored. In a second phase, the task was monitored by a handwritten
   summary delivered before the class. A questionnaire survey showed that
   this type of homework was perceived as fostering a better understanding
   of theory in class and a more appealing class, but only if it was
   controlled as described. In addition, some differences surfaced
   depending on a student's educational background (VAT vs. baccalaureate),
   but also in repeaters vs. non-repeaters. A quantitative comparison of
   final-exam marks and homework marks reveals a better performance by most
   students with sufficient homework, although with some limitations.},

Abstract = {Digital technologies are an integral part of Higher Education teaching,
   revealing a set of technologies chosen to integrate formal learning
   contexts, and therefore being used by students in support of learning.
   This paper presents a literature review mapping the digital technologies
   set for higher education students to use in formal education contexts,
   over the last five years between 2012 and 2017. Results show a pattern
   of technologies reflecting teacher's choice for methods combining
   face-to-face and at distance learning, frequently in relation to the
   adoption of flipped classroom methods. Mapping the digital technologies
   used by students, showed a pattern of three most used in a total of nine
   types identified. Institutional Learning Management Systems mainly
   support a wider access to information and learning materials, followed
   by technologies that promote publishing and sharing content related to
   class activities, and a broad range of technologies categorized under
   ICTs. The overall impact of use of technologies in students learning
   process and outcomes revealed to be positive, used with the intention to
   promote students' active engagement and participation in the learning
   process inside and outside the classroom walls. The data also revealed
   digital technologies to support more transmissive ways of teaching,
   facilitating students individually to Access, share and publish
   information, and significantly lesser used to promote collaborative and
   cooperative learning.},

Abstract = {Use of flipped learning environments, where content is delivered online
   outside of class and class time features student-centered activities, is
   an increasingly popular way to facilitate active learning. The success
   of classroom activities, however, depends on students' willingness to
   complete the out-of-class work and come to class well prepared.
   Therefore, it is important for instructors to understand students'
   attitudes towards required pre-class preparation. This study used an
   online questionnaire, featuring both Likert-type and open-ended
   questions, to explore students' attitudes towards the online video used
   in a flipped undergraduate science class. Results showed moderately
   positive attitudes toward the pre-class video lecture, but also some
   strongly negative attitudes. Results of this study can help instructors
   understand both the benefits of flipped learning from the student
   perspective and the likely sources of resistance. This understanding can
   help instructors anticipate students' concerns and provide effective
   orientation when introducing the flipped learning model in undergraduate
   courses.},

Abstract = {In medical education, the use of flipped classrooms is on the increase.
   The complex, interdependent active- and social learning activities often
   built into the `in-class' phase of this new approach may, however, cause
   cognitive overload, impeding learning. Computer-supported collaborative
   learning could play a role in reducing such cognitive load. The current
   study investigated how four constituent factors of `in-class' scenarios
   for `flipped' classrooms affect the intrinsic, germane and extraneous
   cognitive load for students. After participating in a computer-supported
   `in-class' scenario for a radiology training course that combined
   face-to-face individual activities, small-group work and class-wide
   activities, undergraduate medical students (n = 135) completed a
   questionnaire rating the cognitive load perceived. Computer support
   comprised a program for radiology assessment and a learning dashboard
   that captured and visualized the assessment results. Total intrinsic
   load, germane load, and extraneous load (EL) were calculated from the
   results obtained. The `high' intrinsic load, `high' germane load, and
   `low' EL indicate that the computer-supported `in-class' scenario was
   cognitively challenging but that sufficient mental effort could be spent
   on task performance and learning. We attribute the successful management
   of the cognitive load imposed by this complex in-class scenario to the
   specially designed learning dashboard.},

Abstract = {Flipped Classroom (FC) has become an increasingly popular model in many
   disciplines in today's educational system. In order for the FC model to
   be effective, it is important for the student to have self-regulation
   skills. It is especially important that students have advanced
   self-regulatory skills so that the online learning process of the FC
   model can be successfully completed. It is believed that the
   metacognitive support (MS) provided by the pedagogical agent during the
   online process of the FC model will contribute to the development of
   self-regulation skills of the students. The purpose of this research is
   to examine the impact of MS via pedagogical agent in the FC model on
   students' self-regulation skills.The research was carried out according
   to experimental design, and the participants of the research consist of
   102 university students. The data of the study were collected using
   self-regulated learning scale. As a result of the research, it was seen
   that the students of the experimental group who were provided MS with
   the pedagogic agent were found to have a statistically significant
   higher level of self-regulation skills than the control group students
   who were not provided with MS. Several suggestions have been made for
   the use of pedagogical agent-assisted MS in the design of FC courses.},

Abstract = {In recent years, we have experienced an important change in higher
   education context, which has led to the need for new teaching
   methodologies in which students acquire a much more active and
   responsible role. In this context, we find a new teaching-learning model
   such as the flipped classroom (Bergmann and Sams, 2012). This
   methodology assumes that class time in the classroom is devoted to
   applying, experimenting, researching, etc.; that is, working at the
   highest levels of Bloom's taxonomy. To do this, the teacher must develop
   different practices or activities that serve the student to reinforce
   what was previously learned at home and that, following Santiago and
   Bergmann (2018) can be included within, among others, the following
   categories: peer-to-peer teaching, project-based learning, case studies,
   simulations, roleplaying, cooperative learning and gamification.
   In this paper, we present the students' assessment of the different
   techniques used when inverting the classroom in two subjects related to
   business management. More specifically, we analyze the degree of
   interest and fun they have aroused in them, as well as the extent to
   which each of these techniques has made them participate more actively,
   has improved the relationship with peers and with the teacher and has
   contributed to a greater understanding of the subject. The results show
   that the three methodologies best valued by the students are:
   gamification, role-playing and project-based learning.},

   entitled Elaboration y Traduccion de Textos Cientificos en Geografia,
   given in the call R-700/2017 school year 2017/2018 by the University of
   Murcia. In mentioned project students are expected to acquire the
   subject competences working in collaborative translation assignments,
   encouraging participation among students. Topics are related to their
   professional interests and are related to other subjects, giving rise to
   an interdisciplinary approach and using a constructivist approach by
   using scaffolds and flipped classroom techniques. Contents have been
   uploaded to a collaborative wild, being the professor a facilitator of
   the whole process. Although the impact was initially observed in the
   above subject, it was transferred to other subjects. It is important to
   stress the innovative aspect of the project which is focusing in
   specialized translation rather than in morphosintax and lexis.},

Abstract = {Team-Based Learning is a structured active learning pedagogy with strong
   empirical backing and is seeing increased use in economics instruction.
   This paper describes and assesses the implementation of TBL in general
   education economics courses that are centered around writing and
   discussion. We hypothesize that the structure of TBL will improve
   student preparation, engagement, critical thinking and writing
   performance. The study includes nine courses with three instructors at a
   small liberal arts college; each instructor taught the same course three
   times, twice with TBL. Results indicate that TBL has an equalizing
   impact; students with lower SAT scores see more positive impacts from
   the pedagogy. Additionally, first year students may be negatively
   impacted by using this flipped classroom method, but students in
   subsequent courses who have previously used TBL see substantial positive
   effects. Overall, TBL used throughout a major program could have
   benefits in both equity and performance.},

Abstract = {The technique of classroom flipping has started to make an impact on the
   teaching of economics. An important element of classroom flipping is
   that elements of active learning (e.g. games, experiments and polling)
   are brought into the classroom setting and that content delivery is
   moved (at least partially) from the classroom to the virtual learning
   environment.
   This paper discusses the developments that have prepared the ground for
   the increasing uptake of classroom flipping, namely technical
   innovations and a better appreciation of how students learn.
   In our view the flipped classroom approach has significant promise
   beyond the already existing implementations, mostly by enthusiastic
   teaching staff. As many of the technical challenges have been solved it
   is now the willingness, the availability of time, and the recognition
   and reward of any effort to change the delivery approach that will prove
   to be the most significant hurdles for further adoptions.},

Title = {Improving Student Engagement in Teaching Electric Machines Through

Journal = {IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON EDUCATION},
Year = {2019},
Volume = {62},

Abstract = {Contribution: This paper has demonstrated that the use of blended
   learning in an electrical machines course has increased student
   engagement, pass rate, and scores across the GPA spectrum. Background:
   Lack of engagement by students in electric machine courses have been
   reported across the world. Interventions however, usually take the form
   of laboratory and simulation assignments. There is little information
   on, however, the use of blended learning and flipped classroom
   techniques to combat these problems. Intended Outcomes: Increased
   engagement in the course evidenced by exam performance. In particular,
   for the transformer, dc motor, induction motor, and synchronous motor
   the students should be able to explain the construction and principle of
   operation, and compute voltages, currents and power for various
   operating conditions. Application Design: The approach involved online
   lectures, tutorial submissions, and peer feedback forums followed by
   face to face tutorial sessions. These were chosen because online
   activities would allow students to access material on devices with which
   they are accustomed to engaging deeply and because peer feedback has
   been shown to build community, and increase the quality of discourse for
   both students and lecturer. Findings: There was a significant
   improvement in exam performance when compared to previous years. The
   pass rate of the course moved from approximately 60\% in previous years
   to 86\%. The class average mark also increased from approximately 50\%
   in previous years to 63\%.},

Journal = {INTERACTIVE LEARNING ENVIRONMENTS},
Abstract = {In this study, we used the application software installed on students'
   smart phones as instantly interactive tools during class time in a
   flipped learning context. One popular daily-life instant interaction
   application, Line, provided the students with text or multimedia
   feedback in time sequence; one non-daily instant interaction
   application, PAL+, provided the students with inscribed feedback in time
   sequence; and one educational instant interaction application, SpeakUP!,
   provided the students with anonymous feedback in time sequence. We
   compared the students' behaviors of using the different interactive
   systems for interactions in the flipped classroom class time. The study
   applied learning analytics techniques and used behavioral analysis to
   identify the role of the daily-life instant response application in
   flipped learning, and found how the instant feedback systems enhanced
   discussion in the classroom.},

Title = {Studying Learner's Perception of Attaining Graduate Attributes in
   Capstone Project Units Using Online Flipped Classroom},
Journal = {EDUCATION SCIENCES},
Year = {2021},

Abstract = {This article describes an empirical study to evaluate how the flipped
   learning (FL) approach has impacted a learner's perception in attaining
   the graduate attributes (GAs) of five capstone project units offered at
   Melbourne Institute of Technology in Australia, where the authors are
   affiliated. The subjects include one undergraduate and one postgraduate
   business unit, and one undergraduate and two postgraduate units in
   networking. Our study is distinguished from previous research in two
   novel aspects. First, the subject matter concerns capstone project units
   which are taken by students in the final year of their degree. In these
   units, students are expected to apply a variety of knowledge and skills
   that they have acquired thus far in carrying out an industry-based
   project of substantial complexity. The learning outcomes (LOs) require
   students to apply skills and knowledge that they have learned across
   completed units and connect them with real-world problems. Second, the
   FL approach has been applied wholly in an online virtual classroom
   setting due to the social distancing restrictions enforced by local
   authorities in response to the COVID-19 pandemic. Our hypothesis is that
   FL has positively influenced the perception of learners in their
   attaining the GAs. We tested this hypothesis by using data collected by
   an online survey administered to the student cohorts of the five chosen
   units at the end of Trimester 1 of 2021. The survey, which comprised 14
   questions, assesses a student's perception of achieving the LOs through
   developments in three dimensions, including cognitive, affective, and
   behavioural, acquired in a real-world client setting. Statistical
   analyses of the survey data reveal that the FL approach resulted in a
   positive perception by students of their attaining the GAs through
   achieving the LOs of the capstone project units, which in turn is
   supported by the responses to the three measured dimensions.},

Abstract = {Transitioning from in-person to remote learning can present challenges
   for both the instructional team and the students. Here, we use our
   course ``Biodiversity in the Age of Humans{''} to describe how we
   adapted tools and strategies designed for a flipped classroom to a
   remote learning format. Using anonymous survey data collected from
   students who attended the course either in-person (2019) or remotely
   (2020), we quantify student expectations and experiences and compare
   these between years. We summarize our experience and provide ten
   ``tips{''} or recommendations for a transition to remote learning, which
   we divide into three categories: (a) precourse instructor preparation;
   (b) outside of class use of online materials; and (c) during class
   student engagement. The survey results indicated no negative impact on
   student learning during the remote course compared to in-person
   instruction. We found that communicating with students and assessing
   specific needs, such as access to technology, and being flexible with
   the structure of the course, simplified the transition to remote
   instruction. We also found that short, pre-recorded videos that
   introduce subject materials were among the most valuable elements for
   student learning. We hope that instructors of undergraduate ecology and
   evolution courses can use these recommendations to help establish
   inclusive online learning communities that empower students to acquire
   conceptual knowledge and develop scientific inquiry and literacy skills.},

Abstract = {The aim of this study is to evaluate the effects of flipped learning
   method on students' perception and learning of Java programming where
   the content of the course is delivered in two ways with two groups of
   students, one experimental group and one control group. The experimental
   group was taught with flipped learning method where all materials were
   developed by the researcher in a form of pre-recorded video lectures
   delivered to the students and in-class group activities supervised by
   the instructor. The control group had traditional weekly lectures and
   exercises at home. This study was conducted for 10 weeks with 174
   students in total and employed an explanatory mixed method research
   design with qualitative and quantitative approaches. The data collected
   through the achievement test, Course Evaluation (CEQ), and Students'
   Perceptions/Opinions of Flipped Learning in Engineering Education
   Questionnaire (SOFLEEQ) were analyzed by using descriptive and
   inferential statistical analysis techniques. For data analysis, SPSS
   24.0 was used and alpha level was determined as .05. Significant
   differences were found between the experimental and control group in
   terms of students' achievements and positive reactions towards flipped
   learning methodology. In the experimental group, students' learning
   attitudes, motivation and self-evaluation were enhanced. The findings
   show that flipped classroom outperforms traditional classroom and
   students' perception toward flipped learning became more positive.},

Abstract = {This study proposes an investigation about the active methodology called
   ``inverted classroom{''} and its practices in basic education,
   problematizing how they occur. In the introduction, we justify the
   importance of the topic as an investigative focus. Methodologically, it
   is a qualitative study, it was used a bibliographical review in
   dissertations produced in a national scope that included the active
   methodology methodology, inverted classroom, and the search of the data
   was carried out in the period from 2014 to 2018, in the database of the
   thesis and dissertations captions from the descriptors ``active
   methodology{''} and ``inverse classroom.{''} Preliminary results
   indicated 36 dissertations, of which 8 met the inclusion criteria, being
   6 masters scrito sensu and 02 professional masters, the others were
   excluded because they did not establish an adequate dialogue and in line
   with the theme. The conclusions pointed out that when thinking of the
   inverted classroom as a practice we must consider the fundamental role
   of technology as well as the changing role of the teacher who becomes
   the mediator of the process and we understand that the inverted
   classroom fits like a teaching-learning strategy. However, basic
   education demands new formats of student-teacher-student interaction,
   and it seems that active methodologies are gaining space, but still
   require appropriation by teachers and others involved in academic
   processes.},

Abstract = {Purpose This paper introduces a new instructional design for executive
   programs that combined a flipped classroom methodology and experiential
   learning to address the challenge of teaching highly technical material
   in a compressed time frame. In practice, when decision-making executives
   lack technical expertise and face a highly technical problem, they
   contract for subject-matter expertise (SME) within the firm or through
   hiring consultants. The authors show how this can be done in a classroom
   setting to enhance the learning experience. Design/methodology/approach
   The classroom approach utilizes students from other programs as analysts
   for executive MBA (EMBA) teams faced with case analysis that involves
   technical issues in finance. The analysts act as subject-matter experts
   for the EMBA students. Findings Executive student learning is not eroded
   by relying on the analysts, and, moreover, the use of analysts enhances
   EMBA student understanding Practical implications Executives are able,
   in a short time frame, to produce high quality analysis by utilizing the
   subject-matter experts. Executives also learn how to ask the right
   questions and evaluate the quality of the analysis created by the
   subject-matter experts. The subject-matter experts, who are also
   students, derive added benefits of an employment experience in finance,
   learning how to interpret instructions about the analysis and how to
   respond to feedback. Originality/value The paper illustrates a new
   course design where the course's technical analysis aspects mimic work
   environments enhancing student learning.},

Title = {Implementation of an Inverted Classroom in Structural Design Courses},
Journal = {JOURNAL OF PROFESSIONAL ISSUES IN ENGINEERING EDUCATION AND PRACTICE},
Year = {2018},
Volume = {144},
Number = {3},
Month = {JUL},
Abstract = {The authors have used an inverted (flipped) classroom approach for the
   previous five years in upper level undergraduate courses in structural
   design (Structural Steel and Reinforced Concrete) at Villanova
   University. This paper briefly reviews the history of the courses and
   the motivation behind the decision to switch to the inverted format. It
   also presents details on the structure and the relationship of
   individual course components in the inverted model (recorded lecture
   videos, concept quizzes, problem sets, laboratory exercises, and
   examinations). The effectiveness of the inverted classroom and the
   various structures employed in its implementation are evaluated through
   the use of both student surveys and student performance on examinations.
   These clearly show that students favor the learning environment created
   by the inverted classroom format and student performance and problem
   solving ability improves in these classes. The inverted format also
   allows for a more rational treatment of Bloom's taxonomy within the
   structure of the class.},

Abstract = {Teaching science in higher education has traditionally consisted of
   delivering knowledge as lectures to students following a
   teacher-centered methodology. The flipped methodology known as inverted
   instruction can be used as an alternative approach providing a
   student-centered class. This contribution presents a comparison of two
   different instruction methodologies, Traditional Instruction Methodology
   (TIM) and Inverted Instruction Methodology (IIM), in terms of students'
   perceptions and emotions in a science course. The results after applying
   various data analytics showed that the IIM had a significant influence
   in students' perceptions toward the course and made classes more
   interactive. Besides, the IIM had a positive impact in students'
   emotions self-reported during the course. In fact, the IIM made a
   promotion of positive emotions toward the course, particularly when
   students did not have a prior science educational background. That is
   especially relevant since the majority of students enrolled had not
   taken science subjects in the previous educational levels.},

Abstract = {While current research on the flipped classroom generally focuses on
   test results and (or) student/teacher perceptions as a measurement of
   its pedagogical efficacy, students' adaptation to it and the essential
   conditions for its application are rarely explored. This exploratory
   case study aims to rectify this by examining how university students
   adapted to flipped classrooms implemented in a public university in East
   China. The findings suggest that while the flipped model is impeded by
   entrenched polarity between students in terms of their learning
   dispositions and academic competence, students do develop a prototype of
   theories of learning, a sense of better self through learning from their
   peers and an awareness of the importance of intrinsic motivation. A
   gradualist approach is thus proposed for implementing flipped
   classrooms, which requires longitudinal studies accordingly to
   understand its long-term effects on learning behavior hitherto left
   unexplored.},

Abstract = {The present work analyzes the effectiveness of a program to develop
   emotional intelligence in secondary education. The Training Course on
   Emotional Intelligence (TCEI) offers the opportunity for secondary
   students to develop their emotional intelligence cooperatively applying
   their new knowledge to solve real-world problems. A total of 158
   secondary education students participated in this educational
   experience. A combination of both in-person classes and online classes
   was used in this program in a virtual campus according to the flipped
   classroom methodology. The TCEI prepares students to think critically
   and analytically, to learn about one's own feelings and other people's
   emotions, and to find and use appropriate emotional learning resources.
   The results indicate that improvement in emotional intelligence is
   possible using our program. The implications of these results for
   incorporating emotional competencies into secondary education curriculum
   are discussed.},

Abstract = {Background and purpose: Innovative delivery of research education and
   training in pharmacy education improves student perception of, and
   involvement in, professional pharmacy research. The purpose of this
   project was to utilize a flipped-classroom video technology approach to
   introduce our Capstone research experience and to assess the impact of
   the video technology on student's perceptions of pharmacy research.
   Educational activity and setting: Faculty recorded one-min videos that
   provided an overview of current research. Each video included a research
   introduction, explanation of student incorporation into research, and
   impact of research on the field of expertise. Students were assigned to
   review faculty videos. To assess impact of the videos on students'
   perceptions of research, t-tests compared five variables before and
   after students watched the videos. These variables included research
   curiosity, research interest, research inspiration, research motivation,
   and pharmacy research interest.
   Findings: Across all students, no differences were detected. A
   statistically significant interaction emerged that suggested prior
   pharmacy experience may impact research curiosity, interest, and
   inspiration.
   Summary: Findings demonstrated that the impact of research videos on
   pharmacy students' attitudes and perceptions towards research may depend
   on students' past experiences in a pharmacy setting. Further research is
   needed to identify factors that impact students' perceptions of pharmacy
   research. The information from this study provided our faculty members
   with valuable insights that can be used to better prepare students in
   the laboratory, classroom, and beyond.},

Abstract = {Analyzing the learning analytics from a course provides insights that
   can impact instructional design decisions. This study used educational
   data mining techniques, specifically a longitudinal k-means cluster
   analysis, to identify the strategies students used when completing the
   online portion of an online flipped spreadsheet course. An analysis of
   these results showed that students did tend to follow a specific
   learning strategy as they completed this course. However, students also
   self-regulated to some degree, based on the topic and context of
   specific lessons. These insights not only improve our understanding
   about the students taking the course, but they also provide guidance for
   how the instructional design of the course might be improved. Of note is
   the practical value of this proof-of-concept study in using educational
   data mining to improve the instructional design of a course.},

Abstract = {This study aimed to examine the bibliometric results (co-authorship,
   citation, co-occurrence, bibliographic coupling, and co-citation) of
   publications in the field of instructional design. The study includes
   the publications in the database of the Web of Science in the period
   between 1975 and 2019. It was found through co-authorship analysis that
   9,344 authors who had written in the field of instructional design
   functioned as co-authors and had links. There were studies on an
   instructional design from 103 different countries. It was also found
   that keywords such as e-learning and online learning were frequently
   used and that the studies published in recent years prioritized the
   keywords of the massive open online courses, mobile learning, flipped
   classroom, gamification, and augmented reality. While the most published
   authors were F. Paas and J. van Merrienboer in the field, the author who
   was the most cited was J. Sweller.},

Abstract = {Software engineering education plays an important role in keeping
   students educated with software technologies, processes, and practices
   that are needed by industries. Nevertheless, the nature of software
   engineering learning activities in traditional classrooms is limited in
   scope and time, making it more difficult to achieve a proper balance
   between theory and practice and address industrial demands. This makes
   scant provision for assisting students in keeping their software
   engineering knowledge current. To support software engineering
   education, flipped learning is a suitable strategy. Prior studies have
   shown that students' perceptions in flipped learning environments are
   better than those in traditional learning environments. Nevertheless, in
   flipped learning, students may not have sufficient ability to conduct
   learning out of class. Therefore, the flipped learning strategy should
   aim to meet the needs of students to ensure that they get the
   appropriate support or feedback during the learning process before the
   class. The aim of this study was to propose a flipped learning diagnosis
   approach to promote students' learning out of class in the flipped
   classroom. To explore students' learning performance in software
   engineering courses, three classes of students were invited to learn
   with three different learning approaches (traditional learning approach,
   flipped learning approach, and flipped learning diagnosis approach). The
   results showed that the students who learned with the flipped learning
   diagnosis approach outperformed those students who learned with the
   flipped learning approach or the traditional learning approach.},

Abstract = {Learning the basic concepts of programming and its foundations is
   considered as a challenging task for students to figure out. It is a
   challenging process for lecturers to learn these concepts, as well. The
   current literature on programming training abounds with the examples of
   a wide range of methods employed. Within this context, one of the
   prominent approaches in programming training is flipped classroom (FC)
   model. This article has sought to illuminate the effect of cognitive
   flexibility, problem-solving skills (PSS), and flipped learning
   readiness (FLR) levels on students' programming achievements in
   programming training through FC model. A total of 149 freshmen computer
   science students studying in a state university in Turkey were recruited
   for this study. In this study, designed as a relational screening model,
   a personal form, an achievement test, and three different data
   collection instruments were employed to collect data. For the data
   analysis, structural equation modeling, a multivariate statistical
   analysis technique, was used to reveal a model explaining and predicting
   the relations between programming achievement and different variables.
   The findings clearly indicate that FLR is the most important predictor
   of the programming achievements of students in FC. Other important
   predictors were found as PSS and cognitive flexibility. The research
   model demonstrates that an increase or development in FLR, PSS, and
   cognitive flexibility levels in FC will enhance the achievements of
   students in programming.},

Abstract = {The COVID-19 global pandemic has caused a profound change in the
   teaching pedagogies and assessment strategies in engineering curricula
   worldwide. Concerning this, the article examines the role of
   animation-enhanced concept-in-context maps as a learning resource for
   the introductory materials science course in an online flipped format.
   The research was conducted on second-year mechanical engineering
   undergraduates. The methodology used two-group quasi-experimental design
   where the experimental group received animated concept-in-context maps
   as a learning resource, in contrast to the control group, which obtained
   static concept-in-context maps. The student's understanding of the topic
   was evaluated from their performance in pre-quiz and post-quiz scores.
   The preliminary results of the pilot study turned out to be in favor of
   animation-assisted mapping; further research is in process, and in-depth
   experimentation has been planned.},

Abstract = {The COVID-19 pandemic is a huge challenge to education systems. Most
   governments around the world have temporarily closed schools,
   universities, and colleges. At the same time, teachers and students are
   encouraged to use the online and distance learning programs and
   platforms as an alternative. In the present study, we proposed a series
   of innovative solutions in Medical Molecular Biology education during
   the COVID-19 pandemic in China, including a flipped classroom model,
   live streaming course, chat Apps, and scientific papers on COVID-19 as
   additional learning material. Our results demonstrated that these
   innovations not only help teachers to maintain the teaching process as
   usual but also be useful for protecting students from psychological
   trauma. Our study indicates that online education with a well-designed
   workflow for conducting provides an alternative approach for teachers to
   maintain quality education during the onset of the emerging crisis.},

Abstract = {Teaching is one of the important roles of an academic radiologist.
   Therefore, it is important that radiologists are taught how to
   effectively educate and, in turn, to act as role models of these skills
   to trainees. This is reinforced by the Liaison Committee on Medical
   Education which has the requirement that all residents who interact with
   and teach medical students must undergo training in effective methods of
   teaching. Radiologists are likely familiar with the traditional didactic
   lecture-type teaching format. However, there are many newer innovative
   teaching methods that could be added to the radiologist's teaching
   repertoire, which could be used to enhance the traditional lecture
   format. The Association of University Radiologists Radiology Research
   Alliance Task Force on Noninterpretive Skills therefore presents a
   review of several innovative teaching methods, which include the use of
   audience response technology, long-distance teaching, the flipped
   classroom, and active learning. (C) 2018 Published by Elsevier Inc. on
   behalf of The Association of University Radiologists.},

Abstract = {Researchers and educators have advocated computational thinking (CT)
   should be integrated into K-12 settings as early as elementary schools.
   However, there has been a lack of knowledge of how pre-service K-8
   teachers would be engaged in the learning of CT and its integration in
   different subject areas. In this study, we taught a flipped learning
   module in an undergraduate Educational Technology course. Pre-service
   teachers learned and practiced CT knowledge and skills using a block
   programming app called Hopscotch. Results of this first iteration of
   design-based research showed that the orchestration of the technology
   and instructional methods, such as team-based learning, flipped
   classroom, and pair programming, supported students' transformative
   learning experience. It improved their understanding and application of
   CT concepts. Meanwhile, the mixed-method analysis found some
   instructional issues that needed to be addressed in future iterations.

Abstract = {A growing body of research has demonstrated that open educational
   resources (OER) provide an opportunity for improvements in learning
   outcomes compared to traditional texts. This project builds on the Open
   Education Group's COUP framework to explore student and faculty use and
   perceptions of an open education World Regional Geography textbook.
   World Regional Geography is a lower-level course that is typically
   taught using traditional methods and with an emphasis on breadth over
   depth. As this case study explores, however, the creation and use of OER
   has provided an opportunity to completely reconfigure the course using a
   flipped classroom approach. Further, this study finds a statistically
   significant difference in student perception of OER before and after
   using the open course textbook, a significant difference in how often
   students read the book, and an overall positive response from students.
   Shifting to an open textbook has thus transformed and revitalized the
   class both from a student and an instructor perspective.},

Abstract = {Traditional didactic methods have not been successful in promoting
   independent and reflective students. Thus new teaching techniques are
   essential to optimize the way students learn. This study aimed to
   evaluate the perception of students, from the Faculty of Ceilandia,
   University of Brasilia (FCE/UnB), about the active method ``inverted
   class,{''} which has as its primary characteristic to stimulate the
   student to study and research the contents before the theoretical
   classes or explanation of the teacher. To this end, 64 students of the
   summer course participated in the Flipped Classroom and later evaluated
   the discipline method. Initially, they received a script with clinical
   questions about the class's content, which should be discussed and
   answered about the basic, clinical, and practical application concepts.
   To evaluate the didactic method applied, on the last day of class, the
   summer class students were invited to answer a survey about satisfaction
   when learning the contents. For 98\% of the students, the teaching
   method used was approved. It is also emphasized that this class had 48
   repeating students, unmotivated with the course because, for many, they
   declared themselves unable to be approved. Given the success of the
   method, we decided to apply it throughout 2018, so the method was
   applied to over 180 students of FCE/UnB health courses. In short, it is
   considered that the results presented here to support other studies that
   highlight the need for changes in traditional teaching methods, which is
   a didactic option in undergraduate courses.},

Abstract = {This study explores contradictions that emerge when utilizing a flipped
   classroom approach to university mathematics education. The work uses
   Activity Theory and its principle of dialectical contradiction as a
   theoretical framework to identify and analyse contradictions that arise
   in flipped mathematics classrooms for engineering students. Data were
   collected mainly by means of video recording of classroom activities and
   interviews with two cohorts of first-year engineering students in a
   Norwegian university over two years. An inductive approach to data
   analysis based on the interaction between the theoretical framework and
   the empirical data is used to provide evidence about the contradictions.
   The results show that contradictions manifest themselves as tensions in
   flipped mathematics classrooms. They emerge at different activity levels
   and affect student learning of mathematics. The aim of the study is to
   add to the lack of theoretical underpinning and limited research on
   tensions and contradictions in flipped mathematics classrooms at the
   university level.},

Abstract = {Higher education institutions are increasingly considering the use of a
   form of blended learning, commonly named as flipped classroom (FC), in
   which students watch video lectures drawn from a massive online open
   course (MOOC) before a face-to-face lecture. This methodology is
   attractive, as it allows institutions to reuse high-quality material
   developed for MOOCs, while increasing learning flexibility and the
   students' autonomy. However, the adoption of this methodology is low in
   general, especially in Engineering courses, as its implementation faces
   a number of challenges for students. The most salient challenge is the
   lack of student self-regulatory skills, which may result in frustration
   and low performance. In this paper, we study how a self-regulatory
   learning technological scaffold, which provides students with feedback
   about their activity in the MOOC, affects the engagement and performance
   of students in an Engineering course following a MOOC-based FC approach.
   To this end, we design an observational study with the participation of
   242 students: 133 students in the experimental group (EG) who used a
   technological scaffold and 109 in the control group (CG) who did not. We
   did not find a statistically significant difference between the academic
   achievements of both groups. However, the EG exhibited a statistically
   significant greater engagement with the course and a more accurate
   strategic planning than the CG. The main implications for scaffolding
   self-regulated learning in FC derived from these results are discussed.},

Abstract = {Flipped classroom (FC) approaches have gotten substantial attention in
   the last decade because they have a potential to stimulate student
   engagement as well as active and collaborative learning. The FC is
   generally defined as a strategy that flips the traditional education
   setting, i.e., the information transmission component of a traditional
   face-to-face lecture is moved out of class time. The FC relies on
   technology and is therefore suitable for online or blended learning,
   which were predominant forms of learning during the COVID-19 pandemic
   (March 2020-July 2021). In this paper we present a systematic literature
   review (SLR) of studies that covered online FC approaches in higher
   education during the pandemic. We analyzed 205 publications in total and
   18 in detail. Our research questions were related to the main findings
   about the success of implementation of online FC and recommendations for
   future research. The findings indicated that those who had used FC
   approaches in face-to-face or blended learning environments more
   successfully continued to use them in online environments than those who
   had not used it before. The SLR opened possible questions for future
   research, such as the effectiveness of the FC for different courses and
   contexts, the cognitive and emotional aspects of student engagement, and
   students' data protection. It pointed to the need to examine different
   aspects of online delivery of the FC more comprehensively, and with more
   research rigor.},

Abstract = {Contribution: This article presents an experience report on the
   application of flipped classroom (FC) to the laboratory sessions
   (henceforth lab sessions) of an undergraduate computer science course.
   Background: Hands-on work in computer science lab sessions is typically
   preceded by technical instructions on how to install, configure, and use
   the software and hardware tools needed during the lab. In the course
   under study, this initial explanation took between 14\% and 50\% of the
   lab time, reducing drastically the time available for actual practice.
   It was also observed that students missing any of the labs had trouble
   catching up. Intended Outcomes: The application of FC is expected to
   increase the time for hands-on activities, and improve students'
   performance and motivation. This improvement is expected to be more
   noticeable in those students who are unable to attend all lab sessions.
   Application Design: The study compares the application of FC and a
   traditional methodology. It encompasses two academic courses and
   involves 434 students and six lecturers. Findings: The FC is suitable
   for lab sessions in computer science. Among other results, flipping the
   labs resulted in 24 more minutes of practical and collaborative work on
   average at each lab session. It was observed a significant improvement
   in the motivation of students, with 9 out of every 10 students
   preferring it over traditional methodologies. Also, the FC made it much
   easier for students to catch up after missing a lab, making the final
   grades less dependent on lab attendance.},

Abstract = {Active learning promotes the capacity of problem solving and decision
   making among learners. Teachers who apply instructional processes toward
   active participation of learners help their students develop higher
   order thinking skills. Due to the recent paradigm shift toward adopting
   competency-based curricula in the education of healthcare professionals
   in India, there is an emergent need for physiology instructors to be
   trained in active-learning methodologies and to acquire abilities to
   promote these curriculum changes. To address these issues, a series of
   International Union of Physiological Sciences (IUPS) workshops on
   physiology education techniques in four apex centers in India was
   organized in November 2018 and November 2019. The ``hands-on{''}
   workshops presented the methodologies of case-based learning,
   problem-based learning, and flipped classroom; the participants were
   teachers of basic sciences and human and veterinary medicine. The
   workshop series facilitated capacity building and creation of a national
   network of physiology instructors interested in promoting
   active-learning techniques. The workshops were followed by a
   brainstorming meeting held to assess the outcomes. The aim of this
   report is to provide a model for implementing a coordinated series of
   workshops to support national curriculum change and to identify the
   organizational elements essential for conducting an effective Physiology
   Education workshop. The essential elements include a highly motivated
   core organizing team, constant dialogue between core organizing and
   local organizing committees, a sufficient time frame for planning and
   execution of the event, and opportunities to engage students at host
   institutions in workshop activities.},

Abstract = {The article reports on a study that explored the affordances and
   challenges of the flipped classroom model for an advanced language
   course, involving the implementation of a four-skill integration
   approach and the use of various digital tools. Eighteen advanced
   language students participated in the study over the course of one
   semester. Students carried out a variety of online assignments using
   self-access learning modules in Canvas to prepare them for in-class
   activities. Data from post-surveys and focus group interviews along with
   the student coursework reveal that students had a positive attitude
   towards the flipped model because it gave them agency over their own
   learning and engaged them in meaningful interactions with their peers.
   The study suggests that well-designed tasks are essential, and that
   instructor scaffolding is needed to guide students in learning course
   content. The study contributes a new model of flipped instruction that
   facilitated L2 development in an effective manner.},

Abstract = {The aim of this text, is to describe our teaching role in times of
   pandemic, recounting how we discovered strategies to teach in times of
   virtual presence, as well as the search for new experiences in teacher
   training, highlighting the importance of how we turn them into an
   opportunity for our self-improvement. Procedure: We will discuss the
   strengths and weaknesses that we found while we were going through this
   new path of online teaching, set up for the first time in the
   undergraduate courses of our University. Conclusion: The main
   educational accomplishments we achieved during the pandemic course were,
   to establish a true flipped classroom, and to use ludic strategies that
   were not common in our classes. On the other hand, we highlight the
   close contact we fulfilled with our students, which led them to
   recognize with high opinion our study methodology, the knowledge
   acquired, the strategies used, and our commitment and teaching
   predisposition.},

Abstract = {Background: Minimal information exists about the educational environment
   that will foster learning and engage Generation Z students.
   Purpose: The purposes of this study were to identify the teaching
   methods that Generation Z nursing students preferred and felt were the
   most engaging and effective for learning and to determine their
   engagement level in the classroom setting.
   Methods: This study employed a descriptive, cross-sectional design.
   Results: Lecture with audience response clickers was the most
   preferred/most engaging and effective method for helping Generation Z
   nursing students learn, whereas assigned reading was the least preferred
   method. Students preferred a traditional classroom model instead of a
   flipped classroom. Acquiring skills was the dimension of engagement
   rated the highest by this group of students.
   Conclusions: Innovative lectures that incorporate applicable visual
   images and audience involvement combined with simulation, videos, and
   case studies may encompass a teaching formula that will engage and
   foster learning for Generation Z students.},

Abstract = {Within the last years new online resources such as blogs and podcasts
   are making their way into medical education. With the introduction of
   the internet in the last decades, the field of medical education and
   training has also changed. Consumption of information independent of
   time and location through blogs and podcast is now a part of everyday
   life. The FOAM ({''}Free Open Access Medical Education{''}) community in
   particular is playing a pioneering role here. We discuss the roles of
   blogs and podcasts in medical education and possible applications such
   as the ``flipped classroom{''} concept. We explain the many advantages,
   like their function as a filter against information overload or their
   role in the so called ``knowledge translation gap{''} but we also
   highlight points such as a cult of personality that should be viewed
   critically. Last but not least, we describe the reasons why we run a
   blog ourselves and the challenges we face. (C) 2019 Elsevier Ltd. All

Abstract = {IntroductionPopulation health (PH) is an important component of medical
   school education and is required for physicians to practice effectively.
   Identifying the number of medical schools teaching population health and
   the individual curricular components could lead to a better
   understanding of the current status of population health implementation
   into medical education.Materials and MethodsBetween February and March
   2019, medical schools in the USA were surveyed about the structure and
   content of their population health curriculum. Differences were analyzed
   by school funding and class size.ResultsRespondents were gathered from
   28 (68\%) public and 13 (32\%) private schools; 27 (66\%) schools having
   fewer than 150 students and 14 (34\%) having greater than or equal to
   150. Thirty-two schools (78\%) had a structured PH curriculum. Seven
   (22\%) only had a dedicated preclinical module and 33 (83\%) had a
   longitudinal curriculum throughout multiple years of school. Many
   programs utilized flipped classroom models (n = 19, 46\%); however, only
   8 (20\%) utilized standardized patients. Health disparities (100\%),
   community health initiatives (88\%), and preventative health guidelines
   (88\%) are among the most commonly taught subjects. Quality improvement
   was taught by 34 of 41 programs (83\%), but only sixteen (39\%) schools
   required students to complete a quality improvement
   project.DiscussionDifferences in population health curricula were found
   between school size and funding. As evidenced by this study, most
   medical schools recognize the importance of population health by
   including it in their curriculum and a majority are incorporating the
   subject longitudinally into multiple years of school.},

Abstract = {The purpose of this study was to assess the effect of flipping the
   classroom on final exam scores in a terminal general education college
   mathematics course for a diverse student population. We employed a
   quasiexperimental design. Seven instructors collectively taught 13
   sections of each pedagogy (flipped/traditional). Six hundred thirty-two
   students participated. Common final exams were graded concurrently.
   Mixed-model analyses were performed. Students in flipped sections scored
   5.1 percentage points higher on average than those in traditional
   sections (p = .02) when controlling for math SAT and financial aid
   status, an improvement of 7.8 points among Black students (p < .01) and
   1.0 points among Whites (p= .67). The estimated average difference
   between White and Black students, conditional on covariates, was 5.2
   percentage points in traditional sections (p < .01) and -1.6 in flipped
   sections (p = .39). The 6.8-point difference in achievement gap between
   pedagogies was statistically significant (p < .01). Flipping the
   classroom was associated with improved student performance, particularly
   among Black students.},

Abstract = {Background: As COVID-19 forced in-person courses to transition online,
   an active learning course focused on design thinking in health and
   health care embraced the challenge. Lessons learned, mistakes made, and
   thoughts on the future of online education in nursing are discussed.
   Method: During the online transition, it was thought the
   flipped-classroom approach would transition well using the same design
   thinking methodology taught in the course. Because the course promoted
   rapid innovation and iteration, such a challenge served as a call to
   action, and the course became a valuable real-time case study. Results:
   Based on student surveys, the overall quality of the transitioned course
   increased slightly compared with the previous semester's in-person
   course, indicating schools of nursing can innovate both the way students
   are taught as well as what students are taught. Conclusion: Rather than
   mourn the loss of in-person learning, the newfound possibilities of

Abstract = {In the last five years or so, research has extensively explored the
   benefits and problems of flipped classrooms in helping improve the
   student learning experience. However, little attention has been given to
   the kinds of support that students would need in the process ofmastering
   learning outside class. To address this gap in research and practice,
   the current study proposes and evaluates a learning support framework
   for mastery-based learning outside class that aims to respond to
   students' cognitive and affective needs and needs for developing
   appropriate learning strategies. The proposed framework was evaluated in
   a Chinese language course offered at an Australian university in
   Semester 1, 2016. This study focuses on the qualitative data collected
   through courses, such as screen captures of various learning support
   mechanisms, a student survey, and reflective journals from teachers. Our
   findings highlight the necessity, benefits, and challenges of offering
   learning support for mastery-based learning outside class in the flipped
   classroom context.},

Abstract = {As the current trend of integrating technology in higher education
   worldwide, flipped learning is regard as an instructional strategy and a
   part of blended learning instruction, where the students understand and
   comprehend the instructional contents before attending class by online
   educational videos. In order to maximise learning, this study implements
   and re-designs the flipped learning based on the students' learning
   behaviour and academic performance. This paper adopts a real-word
   example of flipped classroom design in Computer Culture Foundation. The
   data used in the analyses are derived from both the students' learning
   behaviour and the academic performance for the course. The results led
   to the following conclusions: 1) the discussion is critical factors that
   can increase the students' learning interests; 2) the number of access,
   human factor and assignment may affect the students' academic
   performance. And survey data reinforced that the flipping learning model
   is an effective strategy to maximise learning.},

Abstract = {Background: Community engagement is a promising method for teaching
   about social determinants of health (SDOH) through experiential
   learning. The purpose of this article is to report the implementation
   and evaluation of a baccalaureate nursing degree course focused on
   addressing social determinants of health through community engagement.
   Method: The class was structured as a flipped classroom, during which
   students spent the majority of the time engaged with a community site.
   Students were required to attend two in-class seminars. Course
   evaluations were used to provide feedback to refine course delivery and
   assess course impact. Results: Thirty-six students enrolled in the
   course over two semesters. Knowledge and self-reported competencies in
   addressing SDOH in underresourced populations increased. Course
   evaluations demonstrated an increase in students' knowledge and clinical
   skills related to SDOH. Conclusion: A course focused on addressing SDOH
   through community engagement provided a promising approach for preparing
   nursing students to provide care to underresourced populations.},

Title = {Impact of Flipping a First-Year Course on Students' Ability to Complete

Abstract = {The impact of flipping an engineering course on student learning
   outcomes remains an open question because the literature presents a
   perplexing array of results. In this multi-year study, we evaluate the
   impact of flipping a first-year project-based engineering design course.
   We pose two questions: (1) Does a flipped project-based engineering
   design course produce different levels of mastery of engineering design
   process knowledge compared to the lecture version of the course? (2) Do
   students in the lecture class and flipped class achieve the same levels
   of design process knowledge when given tasks that range in difficulty?
   Three strands of data were used to assess design process knowledge:
   first drafts of team technical memos, pre- and post-critiques of a Gantt
   chart of a proposed design process, and an exam. Teams in the flipped
   classroom performed significantly better on the technical memos that
   evaluated solution ideas and established a testing plan, both of which
   required high-level cognitive capacities. However, no differences were
   found between lecture and flipped models for the exam or technical memo
   that established design criteria, which required low-level cognitive
   activities. The Gantt chart assessment produced mixed results. This
   study concludes that flipping a project-based design course can
   significantly improve student learning on more difficult tasks. We urge
   researchers and educators to consider the tasks and assignments given to
   students when drawing conclusions about the effectiveness of flipped
   pedagogy.},

   study},
Journal = {JOURNAL OF PERINATOLOGY},
Abstract = {Objectives The purpose of this study was to develop and regionally pilot
   a digitally innovative curriculum in ethics and professionalism in
   neonatology and study the effects on trainee knowledge and confidence.
   Study design We developed 13 modules in ethics for neonatology fellows
   and piloted them at three academic institutions utilizing a
   flipped-classroom approach. Baseline surveys in ethics knowledge and
   confidence in approaching ethical dilemmas were compared with repeat
   surveys after curriculum completion. Pre- and post-tests were also
   administered for all 13 modules. Results Forty-four of 49 eligible
   fellows participated (90\% response rate). Pre/post comparisons
   demonstrated significant improvements in overall knowledge and in 8/13
   modules, as well as improvement in overall confidence and individually
   when navigating 16/22 ethical dilemmas. Conclusions After completing
   this curriculum, participants' knowledge scores and reported confidence
   in approaching ethical challenges significantly improved. Future steps
   include assessing the effects of this innovative curriculum via an
   ongoing international pilot.},

Abstract = {The main objective of the activity is to solve a financial simulation in
   such a way that the student learns to work in a team through
   organizational and planning skills, results orientation and
   responsibility, as it happens in the business world. The methodology
   used to implement this activity is Flipped Classroom, considering that
   it is the most appropriate for the students to acquire the skills that
   allow them to advise the management team of a company. The activity
   takes place in a consulting project in which a company requests advice
   from our students to make an investment decision. The company needs to
   acquire a transport element and wants to know the financial, accounting
   and tax consequences that could be derived from making the investment
   through two different financing instruments: financial leasing or
   renting. The results of the evaluation carried out by the students show
   significant satisfaction in the acquisition of competences, given that
   60\% consider that the activity has been highly beneficial in their
   learning.},

Abstract = {The use of applied labs has long been an established practice in the
   natural sciences as a means of stressing application of theoretical
   principles and fostering disciplinary excitement. The social sciences
   have seen an advent of similar problem-based approaches, but have not
   adopted a lab-based model. Labs offer an opportunity to use class time
   for purposes of application without moving fully to a flipped classroom
   model. This article presents the use of labs in three undergraduate
   public administration classes: Introduction to Public Administration,
   Research Design and Data Collection, and Statistics and Data Analysis.
   The labs are collaborative and feature both peer and instructor support.
   They utilized an established problem-based strategy to demonstrate the
   real-life applicability of academic topics (Kolb, 1984; Kramer and
   Schechter, 2011). Data collected from 10 sections of the courses before
   and after implementation show increased student satisfaction and greater
   self-reported learning, though the effect on academic performance is
   more moderated.},

Abstract = {Science explanation videos, especially online ones, have become popular.
   They cover nearly all topics from school science curricula. Teachers use
   them in a flipped classroom. Students watch them also in their leisure
   time. However, there is a lack of research on guidelines that effective
   science explanation videos should follow. The research on instructional
   explanations provides essential insights into the effectiveness of
   science explanation videos. The goal of the present article is to
   develop a framework for effective science explanation videos. The
   development consists of two steps. First, criteria for a high explaining
   quality are derived from the research on effective instructional
   explanations. That leads to a coherent theoretical framework that
   requires empirical justification. The second step, therefore, is an
   exploration of the effects of the framework. We developed two
   explanation videos: one high explaining quality (HE) video following the
   framework and one low explaining quality (LE) video explicitly not
   following the framework. Both videos, however, are scientifically
   correct and provide the same learning opportunities. Students from a
   German high school assigned to two groups (n = 90; n = 86) watched,
   respectively, the HE and LE videos, and participated in tests for
   declarative and conceptual knowledge before and after watching the
   videos. The main result is that the HE group outperformed the LE group
   in the achievement of declarative knowledge (Cohen's d = .42, p = .007).
   We interpret that as an argument for the validity of the framework of
   effective science explanation videos presented in this article.},

Abstract = {The flipped classroom model is a form of blended learning in which
   delivery of content occurs with online materials, and face-to-face
   meetings are used for teacher-guided practice. It is important that
   teachers stay up to date with the activities students engage in, which
   may be accomplished with the help of learning analytics (LA). This study
   investigated university teachers' perceptions of whether weekly LA
   reports that summarized student activities supported their teaching
   activities (n = 7). The teachers reported using the LA reports for
   diagnosing and intervening during student activities, and that the
   reports encouraged them to start interaction with students. Teachers did
   sometimes find it difficult to connect the information from the LA
   reports to concrete interventions, which was partly dependent on the
   level of the teacher's experience. LA reports might support teachers
   further by not only offering information, but also by suggesting
   interventions.},

Title = {The flipped classroom in second language learning: A meta-analysis},
Journal = {LANGUAGE TEACHING RESEARCH},
Abstract = {Flipped learning has become a popular approach in various educational
   fields, including second language teaching. In this approach, the
   conventional educational process is reversed so that learners do their
   homework and prepare the material before going to class. Class time is
   then devoted to practice, discussion, and higher-order thinking tasks in
   order to consolidate learning. In this article, we meta-analysed 56
   language learning reports involving 61 unique samples and 4,220
   participants. Our results showed that flipped classrooms outperformed
   traditional classrooms, g = 0.99, 95\% CI (0.81, 1.17), z = 10.90, p <
   .001. However, this effect had high heterogeneity (about 86\%), while
   applying the Trim and Fill method for publication bias made it shrink to
   g = 0.58, 95\% CI (0.37, 0.78). Moderator analysis also showed that
   reports published in non-SSCI-indexed journals tended to find larger
   effects compared to indexed ones, conference proceedings, and university
   theses. The effect of flipped learning did not seem to vary by age, but
   it did vary by proficiency level in that the higher proficiency the
   higher the effects. Flipped learning also had a clear and substantial
   effect on most language outcomes. In contrast, whether the intervention
   used videos and whether the platform was interactive did not turn out to
   be significant moderators. Meta-regression showed that longer
   interventions resulted in only a slight reduction in the effectiveness
   of this approach. We discuss the implications of these findings and
   recommend that future research moves beyond asking whether flipped

Abstract = {In a flipped classroom, students study instructional material before
   class and apply this material during class. To provide a statistical
   synthesis of current research on effects of flipped classrooms, we
   conducted meta-analyses that included 114 studies which compared flipped
   and non-flipped classrooms in secondary and postsecondary education. We
   found a small positive effect on learning outcomes, but no effect was
   found on student satisfaction regarding the learning environment. In
   addition, we found considerable heterogeneity between studies. Moderator
   analyses showed that students in flipped classrooms achieve higher
   learning outcomes when the face-to-face class time was not reduced
   compared to non-flipped classrooms, or when quizzes were added in the
   flipped classrooms. We conclude that a flipping the classroom (FTC)
   approach is a promising pedagogical approach when appropriately
   designed. Our results provide insights into effective instructional FTC
   design characteristics that support an evidence-informed application of
   FTC.},

Abstract = {With the advent of new technologies, Graphic Design studies-focused on
   the development of visual and communication skills- have incorporated
   multimedia and interactive disciplines in order to face the industry
   challenges. These new disciplines include aspects of computer skills
   -professionally necessary- that deviate from the profile of these
   studies, causing learning difficulties. This article describes a
   teaching experience of design, implementation and evaluation carried out
   in a subject of Bachelor in Graphic Design, where students develop
   websites built with HTML and CSS. Using Design-Based Research, it has
   been verified that a proposal based on project-based learning,
   accompanied by problem-based learning, the flipped classroom and
   educative technology, is ideal for this context. The techniques,
   instruments and indicators used to evaluate the experience have been:
   classroom observations, questionnaires, attendance, dropout rate and
   grades. The results have been positive, the acquisition of skills has
   been improved, greater satisfaction has been obtained and better
   academic results have been achieved.},

Abstract = {A competency-based education course, oriented to Visual Literacy and
   Gaming, is proposed within the framework of an educational innovation
   plan for promoting the academic excellence of universities and their
   students. The analysis starts from the theoretical assumptions of Visual
   Literacy and Gaming. Methodologically, the curricular integration of the
   course is presented as a formal education program in Higher Education
   acording to the ADDIE model that proposes the framework of an
   educational innovation plan, following a flipped classroom teaching
   methodology and designing the course as a Digital Educational Object
   (DEO) under the principles of Visual Literacy. The programming of the
   training course is designed as a Learning Object (LO), and an evaluation
   system can also be identified with competency indicators. The design of
   the training program is presented with the necessary conceptual
   framework, skills development exercises, practice to achieve
   competencies and evaluation indicators, which refer to the measurement
   based on the Visual Literacy Standards.},

Title = {Critical Electrocardiogram Curriculum: Setting the Standard for

Journal = {WESTERN JOURNAL OF EMERGENCY MEDICINE},
Year = {2020},
Volume = {21},
Number = {1, SI},
Pages = {52-57},
Month = {JAN},
Abstract = {Introduction: Electrocardiogram (EKG) interpretation is integral to
   emergency medicine (EM).(1) In 2003 Ginde et al. found 48\% of emergency
   medicine (EM) residency directors supported creating a national EKG
   curriculum.(2) No formal national curriculum exists, and it is unknown
   whether residents gain sufficient skill from clinical exposure alone.
   Methods: The authors sought to assess the value of this EKG curriculum,
   which provides exposure to critical EKG patterns, a framework for EKG
   interpretation when the diagnosis is not obvious, and implementation
   guidelines and open access to any interested residency. The Foundations
   of Emergency Medicine (FoEM) EKG I course launched in January 2016,
   followed by EKG II in July 2017; they are benchmarked to post-graduate
   year 1 (PGY) and PGY2 level learners, respectively. Selected topics
   included 15 published critical EKG diagnoses and 33 selected by the
   authors.(5) Cases included presenting symptoms, EKGs, and Free Open
   Access Medical Education (FOAM) links. Full EKG interpretations and
   question answers were provided.
   Results: Enrollment during 2017-2018 included 37 EM residencies with 663
   learners in EKG I and 22 EM residencies with 438 learners in EKG
   I1.Program leaders and learners were surveyed annually. Leaders
   indicated that content was appropriate for intended PGY levels. Leaders
   and learners indicated the curriculum improved the ability of learners
   to interpret EKGs while working in the emergency department (ED).
   Conclusion: There is an unmet need for standardization and improvement
   of EM resident EKG training. Leaders and learners exposed to FoEM EKG
   courses report improved ability of learners to interpret EKGs in the ED.},

Abstract = {As part of curriculum renewal in three introductory chemistry courses at
   the University of Sydney, a partially flipped classroom model was
   implemented. Content that is conventionally delivered in the in-class
   sessions was moved online through the use of web-based tutorials, videos
   and quizzes. During the in-class sessions, active learning opportunities
   were created through the use of guided-inquiry worksheets and clicker
   responses to promote peer-to-peer and instructor-led discussion. Student
   evaluations indicated high satisfaction with the quality of teaching and
   learning resources. In comparison to before these changes, there was a
   statistically significant increase in the number of students achieving
   the higher grades across all three courses. Failure rates decreased or
   remained unchanged. The course with the historically highest attrition
   showed a marked improvement. These results suggest that a partially
   flipped learning model can be useful to enhance student engagement,
   support learning, and positively impact on retention and academic
   performance.},

Abstract = {Objective: Pharmaceutical polymer materials science is a new discipline
   that integrates the fields of materials science, polymer chemistry,
   polymer physics and pharmaceutical preparation and it is an
   indispensable part of modern pharmacy. This study aimed to improve the
   quality of teaching pharmaceutical polymer materials science to a class
   of mixed majors. Materials and Methods: We reformed the teaching content
   and methods of the pharmaceutical polymer materials course at Southwest
   University and implemented strategies to enhance exchange between
   teachers and students. In redesigning the teaching content, we made use
   of multiple teaching methods including example-teaching, heuristic
   teaching, problem-based learning, comparative teaching, interactive
   teaching and the flipped classroom. Results: Reforming teaching methods
   improved teaching quality and student interest in the course.
   Conclusion: The reformed teaching program in this study was effective at
   improving student interest, initiative and enthusiasm for learning. The
   strategies used in this reform should be promoted and applied in the
   teaching of other courses.},

Abstract = {The objective of this study is to highlight the potential of video
   tutorials for learning how to use music editing software as well as
   students' perceptions of their use. The project has been developed
   within a flipped-classroom approach, in which students studied with two
   types of resources: video tutorials and printed tutorials created ad
   hoc. Using a quantitative study with a quasi-experimental design,
   students participating in the project (n = 48) were divided into an
   experimental group (video tutorials) and a control group (printed
   tutorials) in order to evaluate the resource used according to: (1)
   academic results achieved; (2) students' independence; (3) time spent
   completing tasks; (4) motivation generated by the resource. The resource
   used did not result in an improvement of academic performance in those
   students who used video tutorials. However, there has been an
   improvement in time invested in the production of scores, students'
   autonomy in relation to the teacher and motivation towards the resource
   used.},

Title = {Online learning strategies to recruit and train Student Mentors:
   Opportunities for development and integration with face-to-face
   strategies},

Abstract = {Recruitment, training, and ongoing development strategies are critical
   to the success of peer assisted learning programs (PAL), whereby
   experienced students provide academic and social support to fellow
   students. Recent iterations of PAL programs incorporate online learning
   strategies. Online technologies provide learning and communication tools
   to overcome time and geographical barriers when recruiting and training
   students participating in PAL. Online tools, when used in conjunction
   with face-to-face strategies, offer flexible learning environments that
   can be adapted to respond to Student Mentors' developmental learning
   needs. At Victoria University, the Students Supporting Student Learning
   (SSSL) Unit has implemented blended training and development strategies
   in their multi campus Student Mentoring programs. The introduction of
   online recruitment and training processes involved several steps or
   stages for Student Mentors to complete, following a flipped classroom
   approach. Initial online training and recruitment processes assessed
   students' expectations and motivations to become Student Mentors, and
   scaffolded basic mentoring skills that were further developed in
   subsequent face-to-face training sessions. Ongoing development
   opportunities included a blend of face-to-face and online weekly
   sessions that emphasised active learning using reflective activities,
   quizzes, and multimedia resources. This paper discusses the theoretical
   underpinnings of a blended recruitment and learning model for students
   providing support in PAL programs; in particular, online learning and
   peer learning theoretical frameworks. It also describes the process for
   implementing online recruitment and learning strategies for Student
   Mentors at Victoria University. Recommendations on how online and
   blended approaches can enhance recruitment and training/development in
   PAL programs are discussed.},

Abstract = {The use of active methodologies is an alternative to current teaching
   based on the recommendations of both the scientific literature and the
   educational legislation that adjusts to the current profile of students
   and the increase in academic performance. The objective of this work was
   to determine the habitual use of Active Methodologies according to the
   years of experience of the Infant and Primary Education teachers, using
   a sample of 159 teachers from the Region of Murcia. It was observed that
   having more or less years of teaching experience does not seem to have a
   statistically significant impact on the use of the Master Class, PBL,
   Cooperative Learning and Flipped Classroom methodologies; however,
   differences were observed in the use of Gamification and the Kolb cycle.
   Therefore, it was concluded that the greater the experience of the
   teaching staff, the less the use that this makes of the active
   methodologies of Gamification; while the most veteran teachers are those
   who use the Kolb Cycle the most.},

Abstract = {Understanding concepts of food engineering (FE) is fundamental for
   professionals in the discipline, necessary for food scientists,
   appealing to non-food science students, and valuable for curious cooks.
   The challenge of teaching FE is delivering meaningful learning outcomes
   to the different backgrounds, motivations, and interests of the
   audiences. This article delves into the origins of FE in academia and
   the influence on teaching of an expanding food processing industry.
   Current trends demand a FE education with a wider scope, focused on
   consumer needs and wants that convey elements of food product design,
   sustainability, innovation, and culinary applications, among others.
   Although the core concepts of FE have remained practically the same, new
   teaching methodologies call for expanded computational abilities, ample
   access to online contents, and active learning, student-centered
   approaches. As a case study, we describe the implementation of an
   elective flipped classroom course on engineering, science, and
   gastronomy for undergraduate students that include in-class
   demonstrations by chefs.},

Abstract = {This study provides empirical evidence related to two critical
   assumptions in the student engagement literature in higher
   education-namely, the malleability of study effort and the causality of
   the relationship between study effort and student outcomes. We merged
   student-level administrative data on dormitory assignments, study effort
   in a hybrid course, and course performance from a regional college in
   China. Our results indicate that study efforts are more similar for a
   pair of randomly assigned roommates than for a pair of randomly assigned
   non-roommates, indicating the malleability of study effort. In addition,
   we provide evidence on the causal relationship between study effort and
   academic performance by using roommates' study efforts as an
   instrumental variable when estimating the effect of a student's study
   effort on course performance.},

Abstract = {The Flipped Classroom (FC) is an instruction method, where the
   traditional lecture and homework sessions are inverted. Online material
   is given to students in order to gain necessary knowledge before class,
   while class time is devoted to application of this knowledge and
   reflection. The hypothesis is that there could be deep and creative
   discussions when teacher and students physically meet, which has known a
   significant surge of popularity in the past decade. A marked recent
   trend in the FC is the increased use of Learning Analytics (LA) to
   support the development of the FC and students' reflexive learning. The
   aim of this paper is to investigate the literature on applications of LA
   in FCs, and to determine the best practices and needs for technological
   development supporting LA in the FC by means of a scoping review. This
   literature review revealed that there is potential in using LA in the
   FC, especially as a means to predict students' learning outcome and to
   support adaptive learning and improvement on the curriculum. However,
   further long-term studies and development is necessary to encourage
   self-directed learning in students and to develop the whole of the FC
   for a more diverse population of students. We anticipate an increased
   and expanded use of LA to come, with focus on predictive and
   prescriptive analytics providing more adaptive learning experience. We
   also anticipate that LA will expand beyond data mining to correlate
   student performance and online engagement with the aim to include a
   wider range of possibilities of interventions and adaptation of the
   learning experience.},

Abstract = {In the current issue of the Biomedical Journal we gain an insight into
   the regeneration of liver tissue and how an over-the-counter supplement,
   stem cells and two plant extracts counteract liver damage. Furthermore
   the advances against hepatitis C virus are presented, the role of long
   non-coding RNA elucidated as well as the potential of an adhesion G
   protein-coupled receptor. In another contribution, the definition and
   evolutionary impact of copy number variants is clarified. Also, the
   polymorphism of a scaffolding caspase is investigated. We furthermore
   learn about the relation between SARS-CoV2 mutants in dependence of
   geography and explore the challenges of telemedicine in a complex
   healthcare field. A novel approach to engineering artificial grafts is
   presented, the challenges of total knee arthroplasty discussed as well
   as a possible mean of sinus floor elevation for dental implants. At last
   the concept of flipped classroom is scrutinized in terms of usefulness
   for a hospital in Taiwan.},

Abstract = {The combination of project-based learning (PBL) and flipped classroom
   methods offer learners the opportunity to go beyond content acquisition
   to develop further lifelong learning skills. To this end, we proposed a
   flipped project-based learning approach (SRPBL) that foster
   self-regulated learning (SRL) strategies in higher education. In this
   study, the authors examined the impact and effectiveness of the proposed
   approach on various facets of students' SRL, including motivational
   beliefs, self-regulation strategies, and collaborative strategies. A
   quasi-experimental research design that compared pretest and posttest
   measures for 83 students distributed into four groups enrolled in
   different curricular courses across different disciplines: economics,
   tourism, translation, and science of information. These courses took
   place under the guidance and assistance of five facilitators, providing
   appropriate scaffolding and resources for students. Overall, the results
   revealed that the flipped PBL approach has significantly enhanced
   students' SRL skills. It was found that the approach improved the
   students' self-regulation performance among different groups above their
   disciplines and levels. The findings indicated that students who
   actively engaged within flipped PBL activities demonstrated increases in
   cognitive and metacognitive functioning both individually and
   collaboratively. Participants also claimed that the approach was useful
   and effective. Furthermore, qualitative data revealed that the
   pedagogical role of facilitators and the course designing are
   determinant factors for the effectiveness of these student-centered
   learning environments. This study contributes to an advance in the
   understanding of how the development of self-regulated learning
   strategies can be integrated into a flipped project-based learning
   environment in higher education.},

Title = {Flexible learning with multicomponent blended learning mode for
   undergraduate chemistry courses in the pandemic of COVID-19},

Abstract = {Purpose - This paper aims to report a case study in flexible learning
   with multicomponent blended learning mode in an undergraduate chemistry
   course. Traditional chemistry courses usually include lectures,
   tutorials and laboratory sections. For a course ``Advances in Organic
   Synthesis{''} at undergraduate level, it consists of advanced
   information in organic chemistry such as reaction mechanisms, asymmetric
   catalysis, retrosynthesis and applications in synthesis of natural
   products. This course is a difficult subject and requires deep
   understanding of contents. After learning this course, students should
   have comprehensive knowledge in advanced strategies of organic synthesis
   and have an ability to apply them to real cases. This ``flexible
   learning with multicomponent blended learning mode{''} was implemented
   by the authors to enhance student engagement and self-motivation in
   their studies.
   Design/methodology/approach - The authors hoped to enhance students'
   engagement in ``flexible learning{''} - a mixed concept with ``blended
   learning{''} and ``flipped classroom{''} - and called this approach as
   ``multicomponent blended learning mode.{''} Blended learning combines
   face-to-face and e-learning components with interactive Web-based
   components and technical experimental videos were developed. The
   knowledge integrated in different components provides a natural
   environment to link the different synthetic methods together, which help
   students to get a better understanding of the complicated knowledge and
   strengthen their skills. For flipped classroom, students participated in
   the case studies of the organic synthesis and shared their findings to
   other classmates in oral presentations.
   Findings - In this study, both course evaluation score and students'
   academic performance in the ``multicomponent blended learning mode{''}
   were increased significantly when comparing with traditional teaching
   methods in 2011. It was found that students' engagement and their
   self-motivation in learning were enhanced.
   Originality/value - The positive feedback from the students and the
   enhancement of their academic performance supported the value in this
   research. Besides, most universities in Hong Kong have suspended all
   face-to-face classes and conducted all teaching in online mode during
   COVID-19 outbreak. As the multicomponent blended learning mode of this
   course has already been conducted for eight cohorts, the authors are
   confident that this feature can minimize the sudden change in the
   learning habits for the students. As social factors and individual
   variations in students' learning and study mode may affect the learning
   outcomes, these interactive multicomponent e-learning components in this
   special period make students excited when they can study and digest the
   knowledge according to their own pace.},

Abstract = {Objective. To evaluate change in the ability of third-year pharmacy
   students to identify drugs that increase fall risk after training in and
   experience using the Medication Falls Risk Assessment Tool (MFRAT).
   Methods. An assessment was administered to students prior to MFRAT use
   and after MFRAT use. The assessment consisted of 10 medication regimens
   for various chronic conditions (50 distinct drug choices with 30 correct
   answers and 20 distractors), and students were to identify fall risk
   increasing drugs (FRIDs). Using a flipped-classroom approach, students
   viewed an online presentation on FRIDs and then participated in
   instructor guided, in-class application of the MFRAT using
   student-collected data from an actual patient case. Students completed
   medication therapy management (MTM) documentation. The assessment data
   for students who had previously used the MFRAT (experienced) were
   analyzed separately from first time users (inexperienced).
   Results. Three assessment scores were evaluated: number correct (maximum
   30; higher score is better), number of distractors (maximum 20; lower
   score better), and a combined total score (maximum 50; higher score
   better). In inexperienced users (n=104), pre- and post-assessment means
   improved significantly for correct score (24.9 vs 29.5) and total score
   (39.4 vs 44.3). Among experienced users (n=10), pre- and post-assessment
   means improved significantly for correct responses (27.3 vs 29.7),
   distractors (7.0 vs 3.5), and total score (40.3 vs 46.2).
   Conclusion. The ability of both pharmacy students who had used the MFRAT
   previously and those who had not to correctly identify FRIDs increased
   on the post-assessment.},

Title = {Best practices for teaching pharmacology to undergraduate nursing
   students: A systematic review of the literature},
Journal = {NURSE EDUCATION TODAY},
Year = {2019},
Volume = {74},
Pages = {15-24},
Month = {MAR},
Abstract = {Objective: In this systematic review we describe best practices for
   teaching pharmacology to undergraduate baccalaureate nursing students
   based on the available evidence. Numerous teaching strategies employed
   in undergraduate pharmacology courses for nursing students have been
   summarized and compared for their impact on pharmacology knowledge
   retention, application of pharmacology theory to practice, and student
   satisfaction. Future directions for research are discussed.
   Design: The review was performed using the Preferred Reporting Items for
   Systematic Reviews and Meta Analyses (PRISMA) guidelines for systematic
   reviews and meta-analyses.
   Data Sources: The Cumulative Index of Nursing and Allied Health
   Literature (CINAHL), Academic Search Complete, Education Resources
   Information Center (ERIC), and Education Source and Health Reference
   Centre Academic were searched using key search terms and phrases. Twenty
   studies, conducted between 2001 and 2017, met the inclusion criteria.
   Method: Quality assessment was made in accordance with two appraisal
   tools: Kirkpatrick's framework and the Medical Education Research
   Quality Instrument (MERSQI) for quantitative studies.
   Results: Online, simulation, and integrated methods of teaching
   pharmacology were most beneficial for pharmacology knowledge acquisition
   and student satisfaction. Traditional lecture, problem-based learning,
   and a flipped classroom were least effective strategies for teaching
   pharmacology to undergraduate students.
   Conclusions: This systematic review will contribute to the body of
   knowledge used by nurse educators who teach in undergraduate nursing
   programs, may be particularly useful for undergraduate nursing program
   directors/administrators who are considering undergoing curricular
   changes, and may be a conduit for future researchers who wish to design
   studies aimed at improving teaching and learning within undergraduate
   nursing education.},

Abstract = {This paper outlines a practical intervention aiming to collect the
   effects of introducing flexible learning in engineering higher
   education. The work discusses the implementation of the flipped
   classroom method and the threshold concepts in the Turbomachinery
   section of Fluid Engineering course in the third year of Mechanical
   Engineering (Bachelor's degree) at the Universitat Politecnica de
   Catalunya. Fluid Engineering is traditionally one of the hardest courses
   involving a complex interaction between understanding concepts and using
   those concepts in the solution of cases, which also require the
   development of a set of skills. This case study is centred on two
   student cohorts, and the research spans over two consecutive Fall
   semesters. The study is based on sound pedagogy of educational
   technologies, in practice, frequent student-to-instructor interaction,
   academic results, and statistical and survey analyses. A principal
   conclusion is that overall class performance is much higher than that of
   the previous courses. The results indicate that learners gained
   understanding from semester to semester and no statistical significance
   was observed between group and exam format. Students were satisfied with
   the level of suitability and the degree of compliance of the new
   implementation and found it constructive in their learning process, an
   important educational benefit. This positive experience, in terms of
   benefit-cost and outcomes, encourages the intervention without
   sacrificing any curriculum syllabus, but taking advantage and bringing
   the benefits of interactivity distance learning technologies and
   traditional face-to-face lectures. This scholarly research aims to
   contribute to this area, by abandoning traditional lecturing in favour
   of active learning.},

Abstract = {As use of adaptive learning technology in STEM courses gains traction,
   studies evaluating its impacts are important to undertake. Adaptive
   e-learning platforms provide personalized, flexible learning via
   monitoring of student progress and performance and subsequent provision
   of an individualized learning path containing various resources. In this
   study, adaptive technology was utilized in blended and flipped versions
   of a numerical methods course. A particular challenge with flipped
   instruction is preclass preparation, in which videos with the same
   instruction for all students are often assigned. Therefore, to diversify
   preclass learning, the instructor developed adaptive lessons via an NSF
   grant and rigorously assessed outcomes in this flipped class with
   adaptive learning. In addition, to fully evaluate the lessons and
   respond to calls from the literature, the lessons were implemented and
   evaluated in a blended version of the course, which was lecture-based
   with available online resources. Data from previous semesters of flipped
   and blended instruction (without adaptive learning were available),
   enabling a comparison of four instructional methods. The comparisons
   consisted of direct assessment (i.e., exam questions) and affective
   assessment via a survey (i.e., perceptions of the classroom
   environment). An analysis was performed for students collectively and
   for underrepresented minority students in engineering. Focus groups
   enabled a comparison of student perspectives of using adaptive
   technology in blended versus flipped classrooms as well as by
   demographic. Upon combining these outcomes, including a notable Cohen's
   d = 0.34 for open-ended-response performance, the flipped classroom with
   adaptive learning may be the best method for this STEM course.},

Title = {Differentiated Instruction in Secondary Education: A Systematic Review
   of Research Evidence},
Journal = {FRONTIERS IN PSYCHOLOGY},
Year = {2019},
Volume = {10},
Month = {NOV 22},
Abstract = {Differentiated instruction is a pedagogical-didactical approach that
   provides teachers with a starting point for meeting students' diverse
   learning needs. Although differentiated instruction has gained a lot of
   attention in practice and research, notmuch is known about the status of
   the empirical evidence and its benefits for enhancing student
   achievement in secondary education. The current review sets out to
   provide an overview of the theoretical conceptualizations of
   differentiated instruction as well as prior findings on its
   effectiveness. Then, by means of a systematic review of the literature
   from 2006 to 2016, empirical evidence on the effects of within-class
   differentiated instruction for secondary school students' academic
   achievement is evaluated and summarized. After a rigorous search and
   selection process, only 14 papers about 12 unique empirical studies on
   the topic were selected for review. A narrative description of the
   selected papers shows that differentiated instruction has been
   operationalized in many different ways. The selection includes studies
   on generic teacher trainings for differentiated instruction, ability
   grouping and tiering, individualization, mastery learning, heterogeneous
   grouping, and remediation in flipped classroom lessons. The majority of
   the studies show small to moderate positive effects of differentiated
   instruction on student achievement. Summarized effect sizes across
   studies range from d = +0.741 to +0.509 (omitting an outlier). These
   empirical findings give some indication of the possible benefits of
   differentiated instruction. However, they also point out that there are
   still severe knowledge gaps. More research is needed before drawing
   convincing conclusions regarding the effectiveness and value of
   different approaches to differentiated instruction for secondary school
   classes.},

Title = {Synchronous online flip learning with formative gamification quiz:
   instruction during COVID-19},
Journal = {INTERACTIVE TECHNOLOGY AND SMART EDUCATION},
Abstract = {Purpose This study aims to present research evidence on the relevance of
   online gamification flip learning as a pedagogical instruction in
   promoting learning engagement when college students are impacted by the
   coronavirus pandemic. In this study, a gamified formative assessment was
   used to examine learner engagement and to evaluate the effectiveness of
   gamification within a synchronous online flipped instruction.
   Design/methodology/approach A multiphase mixed methods research design
   was used for this study. The evaluation relied on triangulated evidence
   gathered through questionnaire surveys and semi-structured interviews
   administered at an Indonesian college setting. Findings Based on the
   findings, gamified learning and formative assessments that adopt online
   flipped approaches have shown a positive bearing on learner engagement,
   despite the challenges learners face while harrowing through times of
   calamity. The results of this study provide prima facie support for the
   claim that the use of interactive gamified e-quizzes proves to be an
   innovative means of stimulating student engagement during the online
   class. Originality/value The results further suggest that a learning
   framework that incorporates both online flipped and gamification
   techniques provide the stimulus that is likely to forge an emotional
   connection that can inspire learner engagement, much needed when
   learners rally through calamitous events. This study has established
   evidential links between gamification and flipped classroom
   instructional delivery, particularly for online class settings. It is
   well-anticipated that gamification flip learning can continue to be
   implemented either in online, blended or face-to-face class instruction
   and particularly after the time of the pandemic.},

Title = {Flipping the flipped class: using online collaboration to enhance EFL

Abstract = {Extensive research on the in-class synchronous learning aspect of the
   flipped classroom approach (FCA) has rendered favorable results the past
   decade. However, less attention has been placed on the out-of-class
   component of the FCA, specifically the drawbacks that may occur, such as
   low student accountability while watching the pre-assigned video
   lessons, thus coming to class unprepared, and not using the latest
   online technological to its full potential. This study addresses these
   issues by examining the impact of creating a more
   synchronous/collaborative online out-of-class flipped-class component.
   Using the latest online technology, a newly proposed flipped group (PFG)
   was created and then compared to a regular flipped group (RFG), and a
   traditional class (TC) over 14 weeks. Fifty-four undergraduate business
   students from a university in Taiwan participated in the study. Mock
   International English Language Testing System (IELTS) oral
   pre/post-tests were given to all participants to investigate which
   teaching approach is more effective. The results showed the PFG
   significantly improved overall on average, out-preforming the RFG.
   Surprisingly, the TC significantly performed better than the RFG. In
   addition, significant differences and correlations also occurred between
   the PFG and RFG students' online learning behaviors and objective
   performances, such as the time spent online viewing the assigned video
   lessons and the effects on their quiz and final grade scores. This
   study's findings support creating a more synchronous/collaborative
   online learning environment can enhance the out-of-class component of a
   FCA, and therefore help improve student's overall oral/aural EFL
   learning.},

Abstract = {The current online education platform has gradually replaced the
   traditional teaching mode and has become an efficient teaching method.
   Flipping classroom is a new teaching mode under the background of the
   rapid development of information technology. It is also an important way
   of multimedia network teaching. However, compared with the traditional
   teaching mode, teachers in the online teaching platform cannot judge the
   students' psychological activities through the students' state of mind,
   and they can grasp the students' learning status through the teaching
   process. Based on this, based on the cloud computing platform, this
   study improves the data transmission effect and improves the algorithm
   according to the learning process of the online education platform.
   Moreover, this study combines support vector machine to construct a
   student state recognition system suitable for online education platform
   and conducts algorithm performance analysis through experiments. In
   addition, this study uses MKmeans algorithm, Kmeans algorithm and
   improved Kmeans algorithm, that is, K-mediods and Xmeans algorithm to
   compare the pre-processed final data sets. The research results show
   that the proposed algorithm is suitable for network teaching platform
   and has certain practical effects.},

Title = {Utilizing Learning Analytics to Support Students' Academic Self-efficacy
   and Problem-Solving Skills},

Abstract = {The use of the flipped classroom (FC) model in higher education is
   becoming increasingly common. Although the FC model has many benefits,
   there are some limitations using this model for learners who do not have
   self-directed learning skills and do not have a developed learner
   autonomy. One of these limitations is that students with low academic
   self-efficacy (ASE) cannot improve their problem-solving skills (PSS).
   In the FC model, it is thought that these problems can be solved and
   supported by providing learning analytics to the learners and making
   recommendations and guidance based on these results. The aim of this
   study is to investigate the effect of recommendations and guidance based
   on learning analytics on ASE and PSS. The research was conducted
   according to experimental design with pretest-posttest control group and
   mixed methods approach (QUAN + qual) was used. This study was carried
   out on 44 university students randomly assigned to experimental group
   (LA group) and control group (non-LA groups). While feedback messages
   showing learning analytics to LA groups students were sent via learning
   management system (LMS) on a weekly basis, non-LA groups students did
   not receive any feedback messages. The experimental process of the study
   continued for 7 weeks within the FC model. Research data were obtained
   through ASE scale, problem-solving inventory and student opinion form.
   The results of the research show that sending feedback messages showing
   learning analytics to students has a statistically significant effect on
   their ASE and PSS. The qualitative findings of the study confirm the
   results obtained from the quantitative findings. Based on the current
   implementation, various suggestions were summarized for instructors,
   instructional designers, and researchers.},

Abstract = {Children with medical complexity make up a small portion of the
   pediatric population but utilize a large percentage of health care time
   and spending. The medical needs of children with medical complexity are
   highly variable and the education of healthcare providers in the care of
   these children has taken on more significance. Designing curricula and
   educational innovations related to the care of children with medical
   complexity can be challenging. Familiarity with the sociocultural
   theory, the zone of proximal development, Kolb's experiential learning
   model, and the educational resources that already exist allow for more
   ease in developing a curriculum that fits the needs of learners who may
   have a wide range of exposure to children with medical complexity.
   Flipped classroom models, simulations, asynchronous modules, and home
   and community experiences are all useful learning modalities to provide
   a varied and important curriculum. Taking advantage of the knowledge and
   skills of the many different members of the multi-disciplinary team
   caring for children with medical complexity is an important educational
   strategy that provides benefits to the learners and can enhance
   interprofessional education.},

Abstract = {In higher education, many studies have tried to establish which student
   activities predict achievement in blended courses, with the aim of
   optimizing course design. In this paper, we examine whether taking into
   account temporal patterns of student activity and instructional
   conditions of a course help to explain course performance. A course with
   a flipped classroom model (FCM) and a course with an enhanced hybrid
   model (EHM) were compared. The results show that in both cases, a
   regular pattern of activity is more effective than low activity. In the
   FCM, initial low activity is detrimental, whereas in the EHM the
   strategy of cramming later on in the course can still lead to higher
   course performance. In the FCM, a combination of face-to-face and online
   activity led to sufficient course performance, whereas in the EHM,
   face-to-face or online activity on its own could lead to sufficient
   course performance. This study offers a methodological and empirical
   contribution to exploring the role of patterns of activity and
   instructional conditions for course performance.},

Abstract = {Purpose Education as part of medical education is currently changing
   rapidly. Not least because of the corona crisis, more and more digital
   teaching formats and innovative teaching concepts such as the flipped
   classroom model are finding their way into teaching. We analyzed the
   acceptance and effectiveness of traditional teaching methods as well as
   the interest in innovative e-learning methods among medical students in
   the field of radiation oncology at the medical school of the Technical
   University of Munich. Methods We carried out an online-based survey as
   well as a knowledge test on all students from two terms who had
   completed the seminar series of radiation oncology. The survey comprised
   seven questions on the frequency of participation, acceptance, and
   judgment of the effectiveness in terms of learning and on a potential
   use of e-learning methods using a six-point Likert scale. The test
   consisted of 10 multiple-choice questions. Results Traditional teaching
   methods are largely accepted by students and most students consider the
   current learning format to be effective in terms of the teaching effect
   in the field of radiation oncology. However, only about 50\% of all
   knowledge questions were answered correctly. The possible use of
   e-learning methods was judged critically or desired in roughly equal
   parts among the students. Conclusion Traditional seminars enjoy a high
   level of acceptance among students. Effectiveness with regard to the
   internalization of content taught, however, should be increased. After
   all, the future seems to lie in the integration of e-learning in the
   form of educational videos and practical seminars.},

Abstract = {Background: While the term ``information literacy{''} is not often used,
   the skills associated with that concept are now central to the mission
   and accreditation process of medical schools. The simultaneous emphasis
   on critical thinking skills, knowledge acquisition, active learning, and
   development and acceptance of technology perfectly positions libraries
   to be central to and integrated into the curriculum.
   Case Presentation: This case study discusses how one medical school and
   health sciences library leveraged accreditation to develop a sustainable
   and efficient flipped classroom model for teaching information literacy
   skills to first-year medical students. The model provides first-year
   medical students with the opportunity to learn information literacy
   skills, critical thinking skills, and teamwork, and then practice these
   skills throughout the pre-clerkship years.
   Conclusions: The curriculum was deemed a success and will be included in
   next year's first-year curriculum. Faculty have reported substantial
   improvements in the information sources that first-year medical students
   are using in subsequent clinical reasoning conferences and in other
   parts of the curriculum. The effectiveness of the curriculum model was
   assessed using a rubric.},

Abstract = {The generation currently studying medical specialization programs
   belongs to the so-called ``Millennials{''}. The characteristics of this
   generation provoke the need for a change or adjustment in the paradigm
   of the traditional teaching-learning environment. The objective of this
   review is to reaffirm some concepts about the main current models of
   teaching and learning, as well as certain techniques with the potential
   to benefit the learning of the current generation of medical specialty
   residents including the use of information and communication
   technologies. The concepts described include Bloom's taxonomy, Miller's
   pyramid, Dreyfus, skills acquisition, competency-based education model,
   active education and passive education, and evaluation recommendations.
   The revised strategies include flipped classroom, resident as teacher,
   resident as researcher, as well as the incorporation of technologies to
   it. The teacher-student dyad in medical specialties is characterized by
   a particular dynamic, in which the specific objective is the generation
   of new competent and professional doctors. Optimizing the
   teaching-learning environment according to the characteristics of the
   current generation is essential to achieve this goal.},

Abstract = {Context Team-based learning (TBL) is a flipped-classroom approach
   requiring students to study before class. Fully flipped curricula
   usually have fewer in-class hours. However, for practical reasons,
   several programs implement a few weeks of TBL without adjusting the
   semester timetable. Students fear that they will be overloaded by the
   individual and collaborative study hours needed to prepare for TBL.
   Methods We implemented three consecutive weeks of TBL in a 15-week
   lecture-based course on the renal system. In-class time and assessments
   were unchanged for all courses. Four hundred fifty-nine first-year
   undergraduate medical students (229 in 2018; 230 in 2019) were invited
   to complete weekly logs of their individual and collaborative study
   hours during lectures and TBL, along with questionnaires on cognitive
   load and perception of the course. Our program changed from A to E
   grading in 2018 to pass-fail grading in 2019 Results Participants (n =
   324) spent a similar number of hours studying for TBL vs. lectures with
   a mean of 3.1 h/week. Collaborative study was minimal outside class
   (median 0.1 h/week). Results remained similar with pass-fail grading. If
   in-class time were reduced, 18\% of participants said they would have
   used freed-up time to study for TBL. Studying for TBL generated similar
   extraneous cognitive load and lower intrinsic load compared to studying
   for lectures; students were less stressed, and maintained high levels of
   motivation and self-perceived learning. Conclusions Three weeks of
   lectures were replaced by TBL without reducing in-class time. Students
   did not report overload in study hours or in cognitive load.},

Title = {The Effect of Continued Team Randomization on Student's Perception and
   Performance in a Blended Team-Based Teaching Approach},
Journal = {EDUCATION SCIENCES},

Abstract = {The purpose of this study is to investigate how constant changes in team
   allocation within a modified flipped team-based learning (FTBL) study
   can affect student's perception of a course (gathered by an online
   questionnaire) and academic performance. This teaching strategy is a
   team-based learning (TBL) approach combined with flipped classroom
   learning methodology, in which BSc students studying pharmaceutical
   science/biotechnology courses in a UK satellite campus in China preview
   online lectures and apply their knowledge in different in-class
   activities. The students are randomly assigned into teams in each
   session. The project was run across the full academic year (sixteen
   sessions). Students' perceptions regarding modified FTBL were
   statistically analyzed, and their academic performance was compared with
   previous results obtained by the initial FTBL study. Although students
   initially showed reluctance to leave their comfort zone'-the main
   limitation of this study-our findings show that learners perceived
   benefits to the adoption of continued random allocation, which resulted
   in the removal of limitations from their social clustering and eventual
   accustomization to this learning approach. Modified FTBL assisted
   students in enhancing their team-work skills, improving their academic
   performance, developing their reflective capabilities, improving their
   rapport building skills, learning and academic performance. Learners
   also believed that this learning strategy creates critical incidents
   that can simulate their future work environment, as they might be
   expected to work in unfamiliar situations. Therefore, the present study
   indicated strong support for the modified FTBL method, which was seen to
   work exceptionally well despite some minor problems that students
   experienced working in a team with different teammates in every session.},

Title = {Game-based assessment tool using convergence of gamification and
   motivation theory in intelligent tutoring system},
Journal = {PERSONAL AND UBIQUITOUS COMPUTING},
Abstract = {As the online education market grows steadily, video lecture-based
   online educational environments such as the massive open online course
   (MOOC), open courseware (OCW), and flipped classroom are being used
   diversely in informal as well as formal education. However, since the
   learning in the online educational environment is predominantly
   conducted by the learners themselves, problems such as low motivation,
   low concentration, and low completion rates have been identified. For
   this paper, we developed a game-based assessment tool that can enhance
   the learning motivation and concentration and automatically determine if
   the learning without mind-wandering has been completed; accordingly, we
   applied it in university classes as part of a verification experiment to
   investigate the educational usability. The experiment results showed
   that the game-based assessment tool positively impacted the learning
   motivation and reduced the learning burden; besides, all of the subjects
   could enjoy both parts of the game-based assessment tool regardless of
   his/her learning ability. Finally, a sufficiently high potential was
   identified regarding the educational usability of the game-based
   assessment tool.},

Journal = {JOURNAL OF SPECIALISED TRANSLATION},
Year = {2019},

Pages = {146-170},
Month = {JUL},
Abstract = {With video-based learning genres (e.g. MOOCs, the flipped classroom and
   tutorials) increasingly gaining momentum in formal and informal
   education, accessibility needs become a crucial challenge for ensuring
   inclusive learning among diverse audiences, both locally and
   internationally. This paper aims to shed light on unexplored linguistic
   and audiovisual features of video tutorials by looking at instruction as
   a multimodal instance of communication. Using the official PowerPoint
   tutorials as the basis of a pilot study, we propose a model for the
   conceptualisation of semiotic resources, along with translation analysis
   of multilingual versions, specifically an original U.S. English version,
   an Italian translation with interlingual subtitles (partial
   localisation) and a French adaptation (full localisation). Results
   describe the benefits of using intralingual subtitles and best practices
   for enhancing the accessibility and internationalisation of video
   tutorial content, with interlingual subtitles deemed a less effective
   translation method. Finally, adaptation techniques are described in
   their semiotic dimensions of re-creation and transcreation, suggesting
   possible ways in which audiovisual translation theories and methods can
   contribute to the design of video-based learning content for
   international learners.},

Title = {Applying a Modern Pedagogy to Emergency Residency Ultrasound Education},
Journal = {CUREUS JOURNAL OF MEDICAL SCIENCE},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {14},
Number = {3},
Month = {MAR 1},
Abstract = {Background
   Modern technology has revolutionized pedagogy in medicine. With the
   availability of high-quality resources in the palm of our hands, the
   flipped classroom model has gained widespread support. Additionally,
   devices such as ``clickers{''} allow for the ability to interact much
   more directly with lecture participants.
   Objective
   We aimed to investigate the impact of a modern refresh to our emergency
   point of care ultrasound (POCUS) curriculum on resident exam performance
   and satisfaction.
   Methods
   In 2021, we conducted a single-site pre-post interventional study with
   Emergency residents as eligible participants. The interventions included
   two modifications to the POCUS curriculum. First, residents prepared and
   delivered mini-lectures in lieu of formal didactic sessions. Second,
   weekly image review was reimplemented with more active participation.
   Our primary outcome was end-of-rotation exam performance and our
   secondary outcome was learner satisfaction.
   Results
   During the study period, 19 residents participated in the curriculum.
   Exam scores were similar, 90.84\% +/2.27\% and 89.34\% +/- 3.43\% (p =
   0.105) for pre and post-intervention scores respectively. Satisfaction
   surveys were completed by 12 of the 19 participants. On a scale of 1-5,
   average satisfaction was fair (3.9 to 4.1) regarding the mini-lecture
   intervention and high (4.3 to 4.6) for the active weekly image review
   modification.
   Conclusions
   The POCUS curriculum refresh was well-received by emergency medicine
   residents. However, there was no clear competency benefit when compared
   to the traditional approach. The modified active weekly review was
   particularly well-received amongst our residents and maybe a strong
   model for emergency POCUS programs across the country.},

Abstract = {In recent years, thanks to the advent of the Internet technology,
   flipped learning, in which instruction is accessed at home in advance of
   class, has received considerable attention as an alternative to
   traditional lecture-based classroom practices, as it leaves class time
   for developing higher-order competencies such as applying, analyzing and
   evaluating by offering students more opportunities for problem-solving,
   discussion and collaborative learning. The purpose of this article is to
   present a proposal for teaching English word-formation processes, namely
   compounding, conversion, blending and clipping, in higher education
   through flipped learning, understood here as a form of blended learning
   that incorporates elements from traditional face-to-face teaching,
   online instruction and cooperative group work. This teaching proposal,
   which combines the so-called ``discussion-oriented{''} and
   ``group-based{''} flipped classroom models, includes contents,
   objectives, competencies, activities and assessment. Although originally
   designed for Spanish students of English morphology, the proposal is
   easily adaptable to related courses and provides a basis for teaching a
   range of linguistic subjects through the inverted classroom approach.},

Abstract = {AIM The aim of the study was to determine the effect of distance
   learning on knowledge acquisition in undergraduate second-degree nursing
   students, a growing population of nursing students.
   BACKGROUND Distance learning is a convenient way of attaining
   professional training.
   METHOD The study was conducted by critical appraisal and data extraction
   using Joanna Briggs Institute tools for quasi-experimental, qualitative
   systematic reviews and research synthesis and randomized control
   research. Risk for bias was determined using the Cochrane collaboration
   tool.
   RESULTS Eleven studies from five countries are included in the review:
   four quantitative, two qualitative, one mixed-method, and four
   integrative review. Dates range from 2015 to 2018.
   CONCLUSION The evidence suggests that knowledge acquisition is not
   impacted by educational setting alone. Flipped classroom and
   mixed-method instruction were found to positively impact knowledge
   acquisition. Distance learning, coupled with traditional face-to-face
   instruction, has a greater impact on knowledge acquisition than either
   method alone. Online methodologies improve clinical skill acquisition
   more than face-to-face instruction.},

Journal = {JOURNAL OF NURSING EDUCATION},
Year = {2020},
Volume = {59},
Number = {6},
Pages = {305+},
Month = {JUN},
Abstract = {Background:This integrative review examined whether academic performance
   and student satisfaction increased in graduate nursing students when
   using a flipped classroom (FC) modality compared with traditional
   classroom methods. The FC model is an instructional design in which
   students perform traditional learning activities at home via an online
   platform in preparation for performing higher order in-class activities.
   This model has been proven efficacious in many disciplines but has been
   studied only recently in graduate nursing education. Method: A
   literature search identified five articles. Articles were evaluated, and
   themes were identified. Results: Articles were analyzed for rigor using
   standards outlined by Shavelson and Towne. No one operational definition
   of an FC was identified in graduate nursing education. Most studies
   reported positive trends in student performance; however, student and
   faculty satisfaction varied. Conclusion: Current evidence on FC in
   graduate-level nursing education demonstrates an overall lack of rigor.
   The FC model has been inconsistently operationalized in graduate-level
   nursing, prohibiting comparison among studies. This limits the ability
   of evidence-based experts to reproduce studies.},

Abstract = {BackgroundThe Accreditation Council for Graduate Medical Education
   (ACGME) requires that residency programs in emergency medicine plan at
   least 5 hours of didactic experiences per week. Instructional methods
   should include small-group techniques, problem-based learning, or
   computer-based instruction. Despite recommendations from the ACGME, many
   programs' conference didactics continue to include primarily
   lecture-based instruction.
   MethodsThe authors describe instructional methods that promote active
   learning and may be superior to traditional lecture-based education.
   ResultsThese methods include varying instructional methods, case-based
   learning, team-based learning and the flipped classroom, audience
   response systems, simulation, ``wars,{''} oral boards, escape rooms and
   scavenger hunts, expert panel discussions, debates, clinical pathologic
   cases, and leaderboards. The authors discuss how these methods can be
   implemented to make emergency medicine didactic conferences more varied
   and interactive for learners.
   ConclusionsWhile there is minimal research on the efficacy of these
   methods in graduate medical education, many have shown to improvement
   engagement of learners and to be effective in undergraduate medical
   education. Further research will be needed to determine if long-term
   learning outcomes can be improved with these strategies.},

Abstract = {In this research, a Web-based Formative Assessment System (WBFAS) was
   developed for students to support their formative assessment on their
   learning experiences. The system provides students with instant feedback
   which is detailed based on items and criteria-referenced based on tests.
   The present research aims to examine students' acceptance of WBFAS. The
   research was conducted on 381 university students who are enrolled in
   Computer I course designed with Flipped Classroom model. The
   implementation of the research lasted 12 weeks, and at the end of each
   week students participated in WBFAS. The data of the research were
   obtained with the scale of acceptance of web-based assessment system. It
   has been found that the structure of acceptance of WBFAS was consisted
   of elements of computer self-efficacy, ease of use, social influence,
   perceived content, state of enjoyment, state of interest, perceived
   usefulness and usage intention. Based on the findings derived from the
   research, several suggestions were proposed for teachers, instructional
   designers, decision-makers and researchers regarding the development and
   use of WBFAS.},

Title = {Improving Multi-site Interaction Through Remote Learning Technology:
   Report from a Training Program to Increase Underrepresented
   Undergraduate and Medical Students in Health Disparities Research},
Journal = {JOURNAL OF CANCER EDUCATION},
Abstract = {Since 2018, we have evaluated the effectiveness of various teaching
   technologies for training young investigators on translational research
   in cancer health disparities. The Southeast Partnership for Improving
   Research and Training in Cancer Health Disparities (SPIRIT-CHD) unites
   Moffitt Cancer Center and the Louisiana State University Health Sciences
   Center. One of the main components of the SPIRIT-CHD is the Cancer
   Research Education Program (CREP) for training undergraduate and medical
   students from underrepresented backgrounds. The CREP utilizes a
   web-based didactic curriculum to engage students at both institutions in
   biobanking, precision medicine, and cancer health disparities topics. We
   report experiences from our cross-institutional cancer education
   program, specifically evaluating the cohorts' satisfaction and learning
   gains using various communication technologies and instructional
   approaches. Trainees completed a survey with questions evaluating the
   curriculum and technology. Trainees reported satisfaction with the
   flipped classroom model (FCM) content and overall program (mean score =
   3.2, SD = 0.79), and would recommend the program to peers. Yet, despite
   improved program delivery, trainees felt interaction between the two
   sites (mean score = 1.5, SD = 0.85) and engagement with faculty (mean
   score = 2.80, SD = 1.14) could be improved. The technology with the
   highest reported use was e-mail, with a mean score of 4.6 (SD = 0.52).
   LinkedIn and Twitter had the lowest frequency of use with mean scores at
   1.90 (SD = 0.99) and 1.30 (SD = 1.34). Our study highlights the
   successes and challenges of remote learning using technology to increase
   interaction and engagement among trainees and faculty in a multi-site
   cancer research training program.},

Abstract = {In a Food Processing-Unit Operations course, students learn the basic
   equipment that comprises unit operations and techniques commonly used in
   the food industry to prepare, process, and preserve a variety of food
   products. Due to the complexity of these operations, students frequently
   struggle with applying food processing principles to predict how unit
   operations influence the physical, biochemical, sensory, and nutritional
   properties of foods. This study is designed to evaluate how pre-class
   readings and in-class group activities improve the students' learning in
   a Food Processing course. The survey after the exams shows that 48 and
   60\% of students agree that reading assignments and in-class group
   activities help them understand the course material better,
   respectively. The mean value of exam scores shows that the students in
   the intervention section (Spring 2018) had significantly higher scores
   (88.4\%) than that of the two previous sections without intervention
   (77.6\%, Spring 2016 and 82.8\%, Spring 2017) (P < .05). It is concluded
   that using a flipped class element like providing reading assignments
   and quizzes before the lecture can be an effective preparation technique
   for students as well as providing the instructors with critical insight
   into the students' level of understanding before the lecture. This
   allows the instructor to focus time spent in class on areas in which
   students struggle the most.},

Title = {Can students develop clinical competency in treatment planning remotely
   through flipped collaborative case discussion?},
Journal = {EUROPEAN JOURNAL OF DENTAL EDUCATION},
Abstract = {Introduction Effectiveness of flipped learning in clinical education is
   unknown. This study evaluates the effectiveness of remote case-based
   learning for teaching clinical treatment planning compared with
   traditional in-person clinical experience. Materials and Methods Four
   cases containing medical and dental charts were discussed through
   flipped learning with faculty panel during the COVID-19 lockdown. Prior
   to each session, students worked individually or in groups to complete
   assignments with leading questions. After the final assignment, students
   completed a survey to rate the learning experience from each case,
   compare the remote experience with the previous in-person clinical
   experience and provide suggestions to improve remote clinical
   instruction in the future. Students' performance measured by the number
   of case assessments and competencies completed post-lockdown was
   compared with pre-lockdown and the previous year using odd ratio (OR),
   Chi-squared test (chi 2) and significant level p A total of 106 students
   completed the course, and 99 students completed all survey questions.
   Students reported positive learning experiences (overall mean = 7.84, SD
   = 1.11). Post-lockdown, statistically significant increase in the
   proportions of total passed attempts (chi 2 p = .002, OR = 2.23),
   competencies (chi 2 p = .028, OR = 2.05) and case assessments (chi 2 p =
   .004, OR = 2.73) was observed between the current class and the previous
   pre-COVID-19 class (108 students). Post-lockdown, students also passed
   significantly more attempts (chi 2 p < .0001), competencies (chi 2 p <
   .0001) and case assessments (chi 2 p = .008) compared with pre-lockdown.
   Conclusions Although a flipped classroom does not replace in-person
   clinical experience, teaching clinical treatment planning remotely
   improved students' readiness and clinical performance through
   collaborative learning, practice and case exposure.},

Abstract = {This research examines the employing of a Play Curricular Activity
   Reflection Discussion (PCaRD) and Digital Game-based (DGB) through
   flipped learning on the EFL learners' grammar skills to improve their
   achievement and attitudes. The participants were 66 EFL female
   intermediate students in Iran; the research was conducted over 10 weeks.
   A PCaRD DGB flipped learning was used for the experimental group (N =
   33), and a standard flipped classroom was used for the control group (N
   = 33). Both groups constructed using the same teacher, time, coursebook,
   and videos. The PCaRD DGB flipped learning provided mobile-based game
   apps and a game-based feedback mechanism in the form of collaborative
   response and created a setting in which learners could engage in more
   grammar activity, pay more attention to their answers, and improving
   their grammar skills. The results indicated that the PCaRD DGB flipped
   learning outperformed the standard flipped learning in grammar
   achievement and in terms of their positive attitudes. The researcher
   speculates that the PCaRD DGB flipped learning strengthens EFL learners'
   grammar skills and a positive attitude.},

Abstract = {Introduction Selecting an appropriate teaching methodology is one of the
   key stages in education. This study is an attempt to delve into the
   effect of FC through NPE on patient safety knowledge retention in
   nursing and midwifery students. Methods A randomized controlled trial,
   using the Solomon design, was conducted in 2019 on 82 nursing and
   midwifery students enrolled from Bushehr nursing and midwifery school.
   The Subjects were then allocated to four groups via block randomization.
   The Subjects in both intervention groups studied the educational content
   online for 2 weeks and subsequently attended the FC through NPE. Both
   control groups merely received education based on conventional method.
   The post-test was once administered to the four study groups immediately
   after completing the program and once again 2 months after it. Results
   The posttest mean scores of knowledge retention in both intervention
   groups remained the same (P = 0.1), while they were higher in the
   control groups (P < 0.05). The changes in the mean scores of the
   post-test in the intervention and follow-up groups did not demonstrate a
   statistically significant difference between the four study groups (P =
   0.130, F = 1.941). Conclusion The use of the FC through NPE increased
   the knowledge mean scores; however, it failed to affect knowledge
   retention. Given the infancy of this pedagogical approach, further
   studies are needed to investigate its effects on various learning
   outcomes.},

   Implications on the perception, motivation and student academic results},

Abstract = {This paper describes the implementation of the Flipped Learning
   methodology in the subject ``Legal and Professional Context of Physical
   Activity and Sport{''} of the Degree in Physical Activity and Sport
   Sciences, as a response to the increasingly low performance of students
   since the introduction of the Degree. The methodological objective has
   been to enhance the active and collaborative learning inherent in the
   new role of teachers and students within the European Higher Education
   Area (EHEA). Aware of the need to carry out a process of evaluation of
   the impact that this switch may have on students, this paper also
   addresses the study of the expectations and predisposition that this
   methodology has aroused in students (prior to and after the
   implementation). In addition, this paper also describes the insights
   gained, both from student motivation towards the subject and from
   academic results.
   These are the main conclusions. First, in relation to the assessment
   from the students and their subsequent opinion on the methodology, it is
   worth noting that the practical experience has improved the student's
   initial expectations, as they had been evaluated with a previously
   validated ad hoc tool.
   Secondly, in relation to motivation and student academic result, the
   comparison made between students of two groups (experimental and
   control) has shown that even though the experimental group experienced
   an increase in both factors, this increase was not statistically
   significant.},

Title = {On the relationships between behaviors and achievement in
   technology-mediated flipped classrooms: A two-phase online behavioral
   PLS-SEM model},
Journal = {COMPUTERS \& EDUCATION},
Year = {2019},
Volume = {142},
Month = {DEC},
Abstract = {It is argued that flipped classrooms could create a learning environment
   that facilitates learners' self regulated learning (SRL) and improves
   learners' engagement and achievement. However, little research was
   conducted on how learners' behavioral engagement with in-class and
   out-of-class activities could relate to achievement in the flipped
   classroom model. The present study investigates learners' online
   behavioral engagement in nine flipped courses with a total of 431
   undergraduates of a university in Taiwan. All the courses were conducted
   in a blended way, supported by the Moodle platform. The log data was
   analyzed using the Partial Least Squares Structural Equation Modelling
   (PLS-SEM) method. Main findings include (1) no significant direct effect
   of in-class problem solving on achievement was found; (2) out-of-class
   problem solving had a direct positive effect on achievement; (3)
   in-class behavioral engagement had a direct positive effect on
   out-of-class behavioral engagement, (4) in-class behavioral engagement
   had a direct positive effect on engagement in self-reflection and
   self-assessment, (5) engagement in self-reflection and self-assessment
   had a direct positive effect on out-of-class behavioral engagement, and
   (6) the effect of in-class problem solving on achievement was mediated
   by the engagement in out-of-class problem solving. The results suggest
   that in-class problem solving may play a role of motivating follow-up
   out-of-class learning behavior, and out-of-class problem solving may
   play the role of consolidating what is learnt. Theoretical contributions
   and implications for practice, research and future research of this
   study are discussed.},

Abstract = {The purpose of the techno-pedagogical models that have been developed is
   to apply the most accurate information and communication technologies
   (ICT) use to the instructional design that is planned to be executed.
   Among the different models revised to develop the current research, the
   flipped learning model reveals application possibilities in the public
   high schools. In general, the flipped learning model proposes that the
   direct instruction is replaced by learning materials, which are
   delivered outside the class while typical homework activities are
   implemented in class time. On this basis, a flipped classroom experience
   was carried out in the ``Reading comprehension in English as a foreign
   language{''} class in the fifth semester of a public high school in the
   city of Xalapa, Veracruz (Mexico). Digital resources and multimedia
   activities were developed and hosted in a Moodle platform. A
   quantitative-based approach was used along with a quasi-experimental
   design with control and experimental groups. Standardized tests for pre
   and post assessment of written text comprehension were also used. The
   results show statistically important evidences that allow to make some
   promising considerations.},

Abstract = {There is so-called troublesome knowledge in every subject. There is
   various subject-specific research available on what these particular
   concepts are, as well as some examples of how to help students cross
   those thresholds. There is, however, a gap in the area of
   implementation, a more practical format for addressing student learning
   when there are threshold concepts. As active learning encourages deep
   learning, this is key to any pedagogical method used. There is a need
   for a mix of teaching approaches to address the diverse learning styles
   that exist in any class. This paper seeks to provide a viable format
   that can be applied to any subject. This format is based on a flipped
   lesson in physics (in a higher education context) and the results from
   three cohorts across two academic years. The paper highlights the need
   for meta-learning when dealing with threshold concepts, as well as the
   use of interactive videos as a practical tool that contributes to
   self-efficacy.},

Abstract = {This article tries to explain the results obtained in a teaching
   innovation project which joins education and cultural heritage. Taking
   advantage of the holding the exhibition ``The Art of Clara Peeters{''}
   (autumn, 2016), the first exhibition devoted to a woman painter in the
   Prado Museum, we developped a interdisciplinary project-based learning
   with students from Master in Secondary Teacher Training, specialize in
   Social Sciences, of the Malaga University. They had to organize several
   activities for students from secondary education who had the opportunity
   of knowing the role of the women in the history and the art, other
   stories, other geographies, still life paintings o the daily life. In
   this Project, there were applied these methodologies: service-learning,
   problem based learning, collaborative learning, cooperative learning and
   flipped classroom. This projet would achieve the following goals: the
   elimination of prejudices concerning the perception of the master as a
   necessary formality, the enlargement of the practical dimension, the
   implementation of innovative methodologies, the interdisciplinary
   approach, the teamwork and the knowledge the existence of a ``hidden
   curriculum{''}.},

Month = {APR-JUN},
Abstract = {This paper outlines how the Radiology and Diagnostic imagery program at
   the Pontificia Universidad Javeriana adapted itself to deal with the
   fallout of the SARS-CoV-2 epidemic. In-person lectures and seminars were
   migrated online using telepresence tools; whilst hand-on professional
   training and supervised practice were staged and performed in reduced
   groups to comply with person-to-person distancing policies to contain
   the spread of the virus. This was particularly challenging as the
   program makes emphasis on constructivist learning and social engagement.
   After six months, the effects of changes in lecturing were assessed
   through a poll which showed that there was widespread acceptance within
   the whole academic community. Particularly it was observed that use of
   remote presence tools enhanced engagement, improved knowledge
   appropriation and allowed for more flexibility. Therefore, there is
   support for making the implemented actions permanent. Consequently, it
   is an interesting test case for the application of flipped classroom and
   other akin virtual education strategies for developing skills in health
   care, thus contributing to making education more efficient, flexible,
   inclusive and, sustainable.},

Abstract = {Although many studies have demonstrated the effectiveness of flipped
   learning in terms of performance enhancements, there is a lack of
   research investigating the factors that can affect students' performance
   in introductory engineering mathematics courses using flipped learning.
   This study investigated how different factors, including prior
   knowledge, learning styles, and types of problems, can affect the
   flipped classroom students' performance in engineering mathematics.
   Before and after participating in flipped learning covering the concept
   of ordinary differential equations, 139 engineering students' testing
   and survey data were collected. The results showed that, first, two
   learning styles including converging and assimilating played a major
   role in problem-solving, and significantly predicted their final test
   score. Second, when engaging in real-life and non-routine problems
   individually or in collaboration with group members, students' scores in
   the post-test were increased. This study concluded that instructors
   could enhance students' performance in engineering mathematics by
   integrating flipped learning with their current curriculum, helping
   students apply the abstract concepts of mathematics to authentic
   situations, and considering students' learning styles as a factor in
   successful flipped learning.},

Abstract = {This study examines the influence of adopting a student-centered active
   learning approach based on self-determination theory (SDT) to develop
   independent and motivated first-year Australian business undergraduates.
   Existing literature demonstrates how active learningapproaches can help
   to improve student motivation. However, there are no empirical studies
   to assess the influence of active learningclassroom activities on
   student academic performance during their first year of tertiary
   studies. The aim of our study is to contribute to knowledge by
   integrating self-determination theory, and `at-home ethnographic'
   research approach to reflect on how active learning-classroom strategies
   can help tertiary business students become independent learners and
   improve their academic performance. The active learning-classroom
   approach included a scaffolded assessment structure; timely and ongoing
   tutor feedback on assessment criteria and learning outcomes of the
   scaffolded assessments; and social/peer-based learning activities within
   and outside of the classroom to support student performance. The authors
   draw on an `at-home ethnographic' research approach, which allowed the
   teaching team to use their observations during the 13 weeks of teaching,
   and team reflections, to describe not only what they witnessed, but also
   their experiences of how students interacted, and what they did within
   the classroom environment. The study shows that students became
   autonomous and positively benefited from the scaffolded assessment
   structure while evolving to become competent, independent learners due
   to the continuous feedback they received on their assessments, and to
   the active peer learning within and outside of the classroom. Moreover,
   the group assessments provided a platform to engage with academic
   literature, which, in turn, helped students to challenge their
   understanding of the concepts by engaging in critical analysis with
   their peers. The findings can help future tertiary learning designers to
   develop first year assessments that will support students to become
   independent learners and reduce the level of attrition during the first
   year of tertiary education.},

Abstract = {BACKGROUND: Successful implementation of non-small cell lung cancer
   (NSCLC) evidence-based guideline recommendations requires effective
   educational programs that target all clinicians from interdisciplinary
   teams. This study describes and evaluates the Engaging an
   Interdisciplinary Team for NSCLC (GAIN 3.0) experiential learning-based
   educational curriculum.
   METHODS: GAIN 3.0 was designed to enhance interdisciplinary
   collaboration for effective NSCLC diagnosis, assessment, and treatment.
   The program used a flipped classroom model that included an e-learning
   component prior to a live 6-hour interactive program. The interactive
   program included hands-on simulations, small group workshops,
   gamification, and case discussions. Participants included academic and
   community members of multidisciplinary lung cancer teams. Assessments
   included an online baseline survey, a pretest and posttest, a program
   evaluation, a long-term survey (LTS), and on-site faculty evaluation of
   participants.
   RESULTS: Of 416 attendees to 13 live GAIN 3.0 programs (nine in the
   United States and four in Europe), 304 (73\%) completed the pretest and
   187 (45\%) completed the posttest. Out of a perfect score of 12 points,
   program participants had a mean test score of 6.3 +/- 2.1 on the pretest
   (52\%) and 7.8 +/- 2.1 on the posttest (65\%) (P = .03). There was an
   overall knowledge increase of 13\% from pretest to posttest. Most LTS
   respondents (65\%) rated the GAIN 3.0 live programs as ``high
   impact.{''} On the LTS, the areas with the greatest gains in
   participants who had very high confidence were communication across
   disciplines, use of a team-based approach, and personalized treatment.
   CONCLUSIONS: GAIN 3.0 was a highly successful interdisciplinary activity
   that improved participants' knowledge, competence, and likely the
   clinical care provided to patients with NSCLC.},

Abstract = {Introduction
   Addressing the many changing learning needs, styles and readiness of
   students, along with changing environments and advances in technology,
   the ``lectorial{''} as an educational method was introduced to
   first-year university students undertaking a science course in 2016 and
   2017. It was deemed an innovative and radical development from the
   traditional classroom. Reported by de la Harpe and Prentice (2011) after
   an extensive study of their Royal Melbourne Institute of Technology
   students undertaking undergraduate courses, the lectorial featured the
   use of flexible multi-media learning spaces, an accessible online
   interactive platform that engaged students with the content before the
   face-to-face lectorial and an active and conducive large-class
   environment, which allowed for optimal engagement with content, peers
   and staff. Moreover, the lectorial was identified as a strategy to
   reduce boredom in classrooms, a universal experience of university
   students. It is different from a flipped classroom (Milman, 2012), in
   that the learner is exposed to the content outside the classroom and is
   able to identify and address areas of strength and weakness and engage
   in various activities involving authentic case scenarios.},

Abstract = {Much has been discussed about the current teaching model and how it
   could be implemented. In this sense, it is imperative to review the
   curricular organization, time and space of classes, and the teaching
   methodologies adopted by teachers. According to research, the active
   methodologies can help the teaching practice in these challenges,
   because, in this way, the student is transformed into the protagonist
   and responsible for his learning. Therefore, the objective of this
   article is to make a theoretical reflection about the teaching and
   learning process focused on mathematics education with the use of active
   methodologies. For this purpose, the following specific objectives were
   established: to conduct a literature review in books and journals
   published in the last five years about active methodologies for teaching
   mathematics; to conceptualize such methodologies and their importance in
   school education; and to highlight some verified practices and
   successful cases of their application. Regarding the methodological
   procedures, this study followed a qualitative approach, because at this
   point it was not intended to build indicators about the relevance of
   such productions. In conclusion, we identified a great variety of
   methods that can be applied, most of them based on the assumption of the
   flipped classroom.},

Abstract = {The set of strategies developed by teachers to achieve learning is
   called methodology, which has been virtualized as a consequence of the
   pandemic suffered by the planet. The objective was to systematize the
   scientific evidence on virtual methodology, which is developed in
   university contexts and can be applied by the educational community. The
   methodology developed in this research was retrospective from 2010 to
   2020; peer-reviewed articles were identified from the Scopus, Ebsco and
   Eric databases, under the inclusion and exclusion criteria. The Boolean
   operators ``and{''} and ``or{''}, and search equations in Spanish and
   English languages were used, identifying 40 scientific articles that
   complied with the structured process, which answered the question ``What
   virtual methodologies have been applied in university contexts?{''} The
   results show that Flipped classroom is the most used methodology,
   followed by problem-based learning and b-Learning methodology. It should
   also be noted that the emerging platforms are Blackboard Collaborate,
   Moodle and WebCT. It is concluded that it is necessary to detail the
   methods that facilitate teaching and learning, that are innovative and
   that at the same time promote the relationship between teachers and
   students.},

Abstract = {Background: Lifelong learning (LL) is an important outcome of medical
   training. The objective of this study is to measure the orientation of
   medical students toward LL and to determine the types of self-directed
   learning (SDL) activities that contribute toward LL skills. Methods: The
   Jefferson Scale of Physician Lifelong Learning for medical student
   (JeffSPLL-MS) questionnaire was used. Factor analysis was performed,
   Cronbach's alpha and effect size were calculated. The types of learning
   activities that contribute to LL skills were identified. Results:
   Three-factor structure emerged from the factor analysis and were
   identified as learning beliefs and motivation, skills in seeking
   information and attention to learning opportunities. A significant
   increase (p < .05; ES = 0.27) in orientation toward LL with academic
   progression was observed. Clinical students improved significantly in
   the domains of `skills in seeking information' (p < .001; ES = 0.48) and
   `attention to learning opportunities' (p < .001; ES = 0.55).
   Problem-based learning, flipped classroom, guided reading, projects and
   experiential learning activities are perceived to be effective for
   promoting LL. Conclusions: Medical students' LL skills develop
   progressively from preclinical to clinical years. Self-directed learning
   activities are perceived to be effective in promoting LL skills.},

Title = {Educational Interventions to Improve Dental Anatomy Carving Ability of
   Dental Students: A Systematic Review},
Journal = {ANATOMICAL SCIENCES EDUCATION},
Year = {2021},
Volume = {14},
Number = {1},
Pages = {99-109},
Month = {JAN},
Abstract = {This systematic review aimed to identify the level of impact of
   educational strategies for teaching tooth carving on the carving ability
   of undergraduate dental students. The PubMed-NCBI, Cochrane-CENTRAL,
   LILACS, Ibecs, BBO, Web of Science, and Scopus databases were searched
   in May 2019, for randomized controlled trials (RCTs) and two-arm
   non-randomized studies of interventions (NRSI) addressing educational
   interventions toward the dental carving of undergraduate students.
   Studies from the year 2000 until the search date, written in English,
   Portuguese, and Spanish were included. Study screening and data
   extraction were performed in duplicate and blinded. The data were
   presented narratively, considering the dental carving ability of
   students the primary outcome. The risk of bias was assessed using the
   RoB tool 2.0 and ROBINS-I, and the level of evidence was determined with
   GRADE. Of 3,574 studies, 6 were included, with 3 RCTs and 3 NRSIs. Very
   low level of evidence was provided from the NRSIs that flipped classroom
   (1 study; n = 140) and a student-driven revised module (1 study; n =
   264) improved the carving ability of students. Additionally, there was
   moderate evidence of online complementary material (1 RCT; n = 30) and
   reinforcement class improving the carving ability of students (1 RCT; n
   = 29). The replacement of traditional classes by an instructional DVD (1
   RCT; n = 73) and assessment of carving projects through digital systems
   (1 NRSI; n = 79) did not enhance the carving ability of students. Study
   design, risk of bias, and imprecision downgraded the level of evidence.
   There was a very low to moderate evidence on the effectiveness of
   student-driven educational approaches and complementary classes of
   dental anatomy in improving the dental carving ability of students.},

Abstract = {Academic Motivation Scale-Chemistry (AMS-Chemistry), an instrument based
   on the self-determination theory, was used to evaluate students'
   motivation in two organic chemistry courses, where one course was
   primarily lecture-based and the other implemented flipped classroom and
   peer-led team learning (Flip-PLTL) pedagogies. Descriptive statistics
   showed that students in both courses were more extrinsically motivated
   and their motivation moved in negative directions across the semester.
   Factorial multivariate analysis of covariance revealed a main effect of
   pedagogical approach. Students in the Flip-PLTL environment were
   significantly more motivated toward chemistry at the end of the semester
   while controlling for the motivation pre-test scores; however, there was
   no evidence for a sex main effect or an interaction effect between sex
   and pedagogical approach. Correlation results revealed variable
   relationships between motivation subscales and academic achievement at
   different time points. In general, intrinsic motivation subscales were
   significantly and positively correlated with student academic
   achievement; Amotivation was negatively correlated with academic
   achievement. The findings in this study showed the importance of
   Flip-PLTL pedagogies in improving student motivation toward chemistry.},

Abstract = {The article presents findings of the pilot empirical research on the
   performance of the `Mathematical Methods in Psychology' e-course as an
   open digital educational resource for the implementation of blended
   learning using the `flipped classroom' model at the university. The
   students' attitudes toward blended learning in the e-course format,
   their self-esteem of involvement in the learning process, as well as the
   educational results were examined. The main benefits for the students
   are the following: the accessibility of tutorials and information about
   their individual learning trajectory at any time; the convenience of
   self-preparation for classes. The students characterize the activity at
   seminars as active interaction with classmates and a teacher and
   involvement in the learning process. In general, the students positively
   assessed the use of digital resources in the blended learning
   educational process as a modern approach and expressed their wish to
   study other subjects or courses in this format (at other universities in
   Russia and abroad as well). No essential difficulties in taking the
   e-course were revealed. There is a correlation between the students'
   positive evaluations of their own educational outcomes and their
   positive attitude to the new format (p < 0,001). The educational
   outcomes of the students after passing the e-course statistically
   significantly improved (p < 0,001). The blended learning group
   educational results are significantly higher as compared to traditional
   in-class education group (p < 0,001). The study was conducted at the
   Moscow State University of Psychology and Education. The total sample
   size N = 387 students of psychology departments, the experimental group
   size N = 78. The comparison group of traditional full-time education
   students (N = 309) is balanced with the experimental group in the
   following context parameters: gender and age, major academic
   disciplines, same teacher, MSUPE students.},

Abstract = {Knowledge in Computer Science (CS) is essential, and companies have
   increased their demands for CS professionals. Despite this, many jobs
   remain vacant. Furthermore, computational thinking (CT) skills are
   required in all contexts of problem solving. A further serious problem
   arises from the gender disparity in technology related fields. Even if
   tech companies want to hire women in technology, the number of women who
   enter these fields is remarkably low. In high schools with no technical
   focus, most teenagers acquire only low-level skills in CS. The
   consequences are misleading preconceptions about the fundamental ideas
   of CS and stereotype-based expectations. Consequently, many teenagers
   exclude computing from their career path. In this paper, two promising
   concepts to overcome these challenges are presented. In 2018, a
   voluntary gamified lecture ``Design your own app{''}, held at the
   University of Graz for students of all degree programs, was introduced.
   The course attracted over 200 students and received positive
   evaluations. This led to the second concept. In January 2019, a MOOC
   (Massive Open Online Course) with the title ``Get FIT in Computer
   Science{''} was designed and launched in August 2019 on the platform
   iMooX.at with the goal to provide a basic introduction to different
   concepts of CS, including programming and the application of game design
   strategies. The MOOC was accompanied by an offline lecture, following
   the principles of flipped classroom and inverse blended learning. For
   evaluation purposes, we collected data at three stages: 1) during the
   MOOC, 2) during the offline lecture, and 3) two months after the
   lecture. The results showed that the MOOC framework was a promising
   approach to support and motivate at least a certain group of
   first-semester students, especially those who had no prior knowledge in
   CS.},

Abstract = {As the world reeled from the realization that a pandemic of a magnitude
   not seen in a century was upon us, and that physical distancing to
   reduce the speed of transmission was going to necessitate suspension of
   regular classes, university faculty members scrambled to convert their
   planned lectures from in-person to online formats. This article
   describes one faculty member's experiences using a flipped classroom
   approach in a virtual teaching environment. The arrival of COVID-19
   fractured the school year and put some students' graduation in jeopardy.
   From a hasty search of literature on the process of teaching and
   evaluating in an online environment, to a selection of hardware and
   software to provide students with an optimal learning environment while
   ensuring the security and validity of online evaluation, this article
   will highlight some of the successes and pitfalls of a rapid transition
   to online instruction and evaluation. Although there is a body of
   literature on the process and efficacy of online teaching, the
   constantly evolving nature of technology not only continues to produce
   new online instruction tools, but also tools that can be used by
   students to circumvent most cheating prevention measures put in place.},

Abstract = {This article aims to present the results of a study on favourable and
   unfavourable factors of using online learning environments in the study
   process as a digital learning strategy to promote education for
   sustainable development. Technologies have changed traditional
   face-to-face classrooms through online environments to hybrid learning
   spaces. Personal experiences and expectations are part of these hybrid
   learning setups and learner-positive attitudes to such sessions could
   contribute to the effectiveness of hybrid learning and student
   satisfaction. The quasi-experiment was carried out to determine the
   attitude of students towards favourable and unfavourable factors of
   using an online learning environment (OLE) in the study process. Five
   groups of students studied for one semester using the flipped classroom
   method. The sample was made up of 106 secondary school students,
   selected by means of non-probability sampling. Students were given
   pre-test and post-test questionnaires in the beginning and at the end of
   the semester. Favourable factors of using an online learning environment
   identified by students in the beginning of the quasi-experiment were
   grouped in five categories: material resources/base; teacher
   personality; student personality, information presentation and increase
   of accessibility at the institutional level. As students gain more
   experience in using an OLE for learning, it is not technical issues and
   computer literacy that become important, but students' and teachers'
   attitudes and the motivation to improve and learn. At the end of the
   project, the participants emphasised other favourable factors:
   continuous uploading of materials, convenience of use and the promotion
   of online learning environments for studies in all subjects. The role of
   the teacher while using an online learning environment was highlighted.
   This research contributes to the improvement of teacher pedagogical
   competences, creating conditions for increasing student satisfaction.},

Title = {Perception of nursing students about the implementation of GREENS (c)
   methodology in nursing studies},
Journal = {NURSE EDUCATION TODAY},
Year = {2020},
Volume = {92},
Month = {SEP},
Abstract = {Background: The Gymkhana Room for Education and Evaluation in Nursing
   Studies (GREENS (c)) is a pedagogical model that can be used as a
   learning and assessment method in nursing training workshops. This model
   combines the advantages of gamification, the flipped classroom and the
   use of low-fidelity clinical simulation, also including self-reflection
   and peer evaluation of the situations experienced.
   Objectives: To evaluate the students' perception of the implementation
   of GREENS (c) as a learning and assessment tool in an academic course at
   the University of Almeria.
   Design: A cross-sectional descriptive study.
   Settings: Academic year 2018/2019, at the University of Almeria (UAL),
   Spain. Participants: 77 students enrolled in their 2nd year of the
   Nursing Degree who attended the ``Health Promotion and Safety{''} class.
   Methods: After completing the GREENS (c) activity, the perception and
   anxiety of students were analyzed through an online ad hoc questionnaire
   composed of 17 questions. Data were collected in January 2019.
   Results: All of the questions scored above 4 out of a maximum of 5 on a
   Likert scale. For all the questions,> 50\% of the students were in total
   agreement with the questions answered, showing a high acceptance of the
   GREENS (c) methodology implementation. The students reported that their
   anxiety decreased significantly, with a score of 4.7 points on average
   (95\% CI: 4.16 to 5.33, p < 0.001), after knowing that the assessment
   would be through a gamification tool, not an oral one. More than 60\% of
   the students answered ``agree{''} or ``strongly agree{''} with the idea
   that GREENS (c) is useful for improving motivation, teamwork, learning,
   fun and knowledge assessment.
   Conclusions: The use of GREENS (c) has generated a high satisfaction and
   motivation of the students in their learning process, and as an
   assessment tool, it created a lower degree of anxiety as compared to an
   oral examination.},

Abstract = {As much as we do not like to admit it, the world we live in is nothing
   like the world of 50 years ago. A visitor from 1940 would not recognize
   the place he had come from, in styles of dress, doing things, and
   architecture too. People have had to adapt their lives as technology
   advanced, and in the last 50 years, more technological advancements
   happened than in 300 years before that. In our world where everything is
   perpetually changing, each person must make dynamic changes to be an
   effective agent for a better future. With all the changes that have
   occurred over the years of education, the one thing that has almost
   never changed is the need for all people to be critical thinking people
   and aware of everything else around them. Human beings are probably the
   only creatures in the world that are capable of critical thinking, and
   therefore are the sole agents of future changes. The likely candidates
   who are ready to take over this role of critical thinking is the group
   of undergraduate students who are soon to enter the world's economy.
   This paper will closely scrutinize the role of the critical thinker and
   elaborate on the methods to measure which can be suitable for all
   students to learn from so that they in turn can become critical
   thinkers. This will help affect the ever more necessary future changes
   for the continual betterment of the world and elucidate the critical
   thinking measurement methods that will be suitable to use with
   undergraduate students of all places and levels making it able to
   reveal, grade, and assess this skillset, which is ultimately important,
   but difficult to quantify. In this study, the author introduces the
   addition of a reversed system, the flipped classroom, in conjunction
   with the established norm of teaching methods.},

Title = {Self-regulated learning in a competency-based and flipped learning
   environment: learning strategies across achievement levels and years},
Journal = {MEDICAL EDUCATION ONLINE},

Abstract = {Background: The transition from a traditional lecture-based curriculum
   to a competency-based curriculum poses significant challenges to both
   students and faculty in medical schools, especially when the curriculum
   is implemented in a flipped learning environment. Self-regulated
   learning (SRL) has been proven to be beneficial for competency-based
   learning and flipped classroom learning, but medical educators cannot
   expect our entering medical students to bring in these learning skills
   automatically. Methods: This study took place in the Michigan State
   University College of Human Medicine. A new competency-based curriculum
   was implemented in the fall 2016, focusing on the integration of basic
   science and clinical experience. Participants in this study were 26
   first- and second-year students. By interviewing each student about the
   learning strategies they use in independent learning before class, we
   investigated how students use SRL strategies in different phases of
   learning, and how their adoption of SRL strategies differ across
   self-perceived achievement groups and years. Results: We found that
   students frequently use strategies in the stages of planning and
   reflection, but less frequently during the learning or monitoring phase.
   Students who perceive themselves as high achieving, and students in
   their second year of medical school do use more learning strategies
   during the monitoring stage than their counterparts. Conclusions:
   Students who lack self-regulation strategies may fail to comprehend or
   connect ideas in their pre-class learning, which could lead to
   ineffective learning outcomes during in-class activities. Our study
   indicated that while medical students, who tend to be successful
   learners in their undergraduate study, were able to use learning
   strategies to plan and reflect on their learning, they need more
   explicit instruction in how to monitor their own learning.},

Title = {Medical Student Engagement in a Virtual Learning Environment Positively
   Correlates with Course Performance and Satisfaction in Psychiatry},

Abstract = {Introduction There has been a move to a ``flipped classroom{''} (FC) in
   medical education. The FC promotes active learning and utilizes
   independent preparation prior to in-class sessions. Few studies have
   evaluated the effectiveness of the FC approach in medical education,
   specifically via virtual learning. The purpose of this study evaluates
   student and faculty perceptions of the FC approach and relationships
   between student engagement and performance. Method The first-year
   medical student psychiatry curriculum was redesigned with an FC approach
   and subsequently altered by COVID-19 to a virtual learning environment.
   A mixed-method approach was used to examine both qualitative assessment
   and quantitative performance data. Students and facilitators were
   invited to participate in surveys regarding the curriculum changes.
   Student performance data was collected via quizzes and examinations.
   Engagement was evaluated by student participation in National Board of
   Medical Examiners-style multiple-choice questions delivered via Top Hat
   (R). Correlational analyses were used to evaluate associations between
   engagement and performance. T-tests were used to compare student
   satisfaction across 2019 and 2020. Results Performance on in-class
   questions was positively associated with class rank and performance (p <
   0.005). More students were either satisfied or strongly satisfied
   (91.5\%) in 2020 compared to 85.7\% in 2019 (two-tailed t-test, p =
   0.04). Most students (81.3\%) preferred in-class questions to lectures.
   In 2020, 62.6\% of student comments were positive regarding the
   psychiatry curriculum vs 33.3\% in 2019. Over 61.5\% of facilitators
   felt positive towards the changes. Conclusion Our results demonstrate a
   positive relationship between engagement and class performance. Students
   and facilitators positively perceived the approach, with students
   preferring in-class questions compared to lectures. Future research
   should evaluate overall performance on standardized tests, third-year
   clerkships, and number of students matching into psychiatry.},

Title = {COVID-19 Lockdown Effects on Student Grades of a University Engineering
   Course: A Psychometric Study},
Journal = {IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON EDUCATION},
Abstract = {Contribution: This article is centered on effects that the COVID-19
   lockdown has produced on the student performance in specific engineering
   course. The study treats to evaluate if the changes in the teaching and
   student assessment have been suited. Background: Most of higher
   education courses have had to adapt to this situation and made quick
   changes in its teaching and evaluation. The course applied computing was
   not the exception and has to split into two blocks. Teaching and
   evaluation of the first block was given totally in-person with
   traditional methodology. On the other hand, the second block that was
   affected by the lockdown, was fully taught with online flipped classroom
   (FC) teaching and remote assessment. Research Questions: This has given
   the opportunity to analyze how these changes have affected the student
   performance and what benefits of incorporated online FC teaching have
   been produced in this course. Methodology: The reliability of tests and
   item analysis techniques have been employed to measure the consistency
   and the item difficulty of the performed tests, respectively. From this
   psychometric study, the quality of the methodology of student assessment
   can be established. The study is also applied to the previous year where
   the in-person traditional methodology was employed. Moreover, the
   effectiveness of the teaching methodology is analyzed with student
   surveys. Findings: The reliability of online student assessment for FC
   teaching is high, yet when compared with traditional assessment for this
   specific course in both analyzed years. The different level of item
   difficulty is constant in the first block, being a possible cause for
   the low reliability of the test. Moreover, student surveys and student
   performance suggest that the online FC teaching method can be suitable
   for this specific course, and can be applied in the future.},

Abstract = {The purpose of this study is to compare and contrast on-ground, hybrid,
   online, and flipped teaching techniques in the L2 classroom as to
   determine which delivery method best promotes student learning, target
   language use, and language spontaneity among students. Data was
   collected for three semesters at a college in the Midwestern region of
   the United States from different sections of the same introductory-level
   Spanish course. The differences between the class sections was the
   delivery method (one for each type of the aforementioned methods). A
   sample group of 53 participants were compared with the
   on-ground/traditional class section final and oral exams and compared
   with the on-ground/traditional section using unpaired t tests. Each of
   the class instructors maintained a journal to document qualitative
   classroom experiences. The study concludes that no one group performed
   statistically better than the other group on the oral exams. There were
   no statistically significant differences on the final exams, except with
   the online class group which performed worse. The delivery method
   selected should be based on student, community, and departmental needs.
   However, instructor journals noted greater target language use in the
   flipped and hybrid sections.},

Abstract = {Flipped learning has become a popular approach for supporting higher
   education, but less is known about its link with the learners' emotions,
   which are known to play an important role in science education. The main
   purpose of this study is to analyse the effects of the flipped learning
   approach on students' learning emotions. This research utilised a
   quasi-experimental design with two data collection time points (pre- and
   post-study). The sample involved 65 students from the science track in
   one Saudi university. The participants were distributed into two groups,
   taught by the traditional and the flipped learning methods respectively.
   Data collection took place over a period of 4 study weeks. The results
   show that the flipped mode group had obtained higher learning emotions
   mean score compared to its traditional counterpart, and they showed
   improvement in learning emotions mean score over the period of the
   study. The findings indicate that further study is needed both to
   validate the current study in a different context , and also to
   determine how the flipped learning environment can better support
   students' interactions and their emotions.},

Abstract = {Training for language teaching profession is a challenge, where
   innovative practices and digital technology can bring benefits. In this
   article, we focus on the training of future teachers of French as a
   foreign language. We present an innovative teaching, mixing a flipped
   classroom and blended learning approach, for students following an
   introductory course in language didactics. The aim of this research is
   to understand how students perceive the language teaching profession
   before the course, and how they see their development of skills related
   to their future profession after attending the training. Our approach
   consists of a text analysis and qualitative analysis of declarative data
   from participants in this innovative scheme, before the course, and
   after the course, with a view to ascertaining their appreciation of the
   development of skills to become a language teacher. We collected the
   students' responses to surveys given before and after the course in the
   first semester of the academic year 2020/2021. The first survey, given
   before the course, dealt with the words associated with teaching,
   learning and class, as well as the definition of a good language course
   and the profession of FFL teacher. The second survey, given after the
   course, concerned the usefulness of the course for the professional
   objective and a self-evaluation of the skills developed. The analysis
   shows that the participants have a positive view of the teaching
   profession, but also describe it in a more traditional way. Results also
   show that most students felt that the course was useful for their
   professional life and that they developed several competences related to
   their definition of the profession.
   These results lead to the conclusion that these representations about
   FFL teachers have to be taken into account during the course, in order
   to make the students aware of the different facets of the profession.},

Abstract = {The article presents the comparative empirical study findings of the
   opinions of students after completing e-courses in mathematical methods
   in psychoeducational researches in blended learning format according to
   the ``flipped classroom{''} model. Possible learning difficulties are
   examined, the involvement, learning and testing independence, the
   practical benefits and the attitude to this format among master's
   programs and second higher education programs students as compared with
   undergraduate programs students are assessed. Using the logistic
   regression analysis method the predictors characterizing each of these
   categories are determined. Contrary to expectations, the differences are
   not fundamental, which refutes the prevailing stereotypes. The
   overwhelming majority of both groups students did not have significant
   difficulties, the tests were useful for better content assimilation, the
   e-course allowed them to track their individual trajectory, and there
   were enough personal contacts with the teacher. Master's programs
   students and students of the second higher education ones almost
   unanimously disagree that the e-courses reduce the education quality,
   but agree that the use of online-courses is a modern need, and it is
   high time to introduce them. Almost all students of both groups believe
   that online-learning solves the problems of employed students, and claim
   that they like this e-course. Students of master's programs and students
   of the second higher education ones are more likely to argue that they
   studied much more intensively in e-course seminars than in traditional
   in-class education, and immediately got involved in the learning
   process, and less often agree to replace face-to-face classes with
   webinars. They somewhat less often confirm that they helped classmates
   at the seminars. The course is rated as practically useful. The problem
   of dishonest strategies requires further investigation. The total sample
   size N = 344 students of psychological faculties of the Moscow State
   University of Psychology and Education.},

Abstract = {The aim of this study was to compare the effect of different types of
   instructional styles traditional lecture with and without video examples
   and contemporary format that simulated a flipped classroom on dental
   students' learning of behavior guidance techniques (BGTs) in pediatric
   dentistry. The study also sought to determine if students had an
   improved comfort level with BGTs with these instructional methods, if
   videos improved learning and comfort with BGTs, and if there were
   differences in outcomes by gender. All 96 second-year dental students at
   one U.S. dental school were recruited to participate in the study in
   2017. Students were randomly divided into three groups: contemporary
   instruction (CI), traditional instruction with video (TIV), and
   traditional instruction with no video (TI). CI students watched a
   20-minute mini-lecture and were divided into discussion groups led by
   calibrated faculty members. TIV students received 50 minutes of
   traditional lecture with video examples. TI students received a
   traditional lecture with no video examples. All groups completed a
   questionnaire prior to and on completion of the course. The
   questionnaire assessed students' learning and perceptions of the
   learning experience. All students participated in the course and the
   assessments, for a 100\% response rate. The students' post-course scores
   improved for all teaching methods (TI>CI>TIV) with no significant
   differences among them. CI students rated comfort with BGTs and
   usefulness of videos higher than the other groups, but the difference
   was not statistically significant. Students rated their satisfaction
   with and usefulness of the course high for all groups (>3 on a
   four-point scale). Learning style and comfort treating children were not
   statistically significant by gender. Overall, the students reported high
   satisfaction with all the teaching methods. Although the differences
   were not statistically significant, discussion groups were ranked
   highest in satisfaction and usefulness.},

Abstract = {In flipped learning (FL), the pre-class section plays an important role
   and determines whether meaningful and deep-level learning can take place
   in the following in-class section. However, previous studies focus on
   in-class learning and research little on the pre-class section. In order
   to explore an interactive mode which can ensure the effect of pre-class
   learning, a production-oriented peer collaboration FL framework was
   proposed and applied to the Business English course. Mixed research
   methods including questionnaire and focus group interview were used to
   test the effectiveness of the framework and explore effective forms of
   interaction. Data analysis shows that the FL framework improved
   significantly social interaction self-efficacy, help-seeking, and
   self-evaluation in self-regulated learning, thus ensured quality
   pre-class learning. As to interaction, eight collaboration forms were
   found through thematic analysis, namely comparison, correction, reaching
   agreement, supervision, inspiration, complementation, negotiation, and
   emotional support. Among them, comparison is the most beneficial and
   frequently mentioned collaborative behavior. This research provides an
   empirical case for peer interaction based on online learning tasks. It
   helps enrich interactive research in FL and provides teaching reference
   for practitioner teachers by offering a feasible framework.},

Abstract = {The novel coronavirus 2019 pandemic has led to new dilemmas in medical
   education because of an initial shortage of personal protective
   equipment, uncertainty regarding disease transmission and treatments,
   travel restrictions, and social distancing guidelines. These new
   problems further compound the already existing problem of limited
   medical student exposure to the field of physical medicine and
   rehabilitation, particularly for students in medical schools lacking a
   department of physical medicine and rehabilitation, approximately 50\%
   of medical schools. A virtual medical student physical medicine and
   rehabilitation rotation was created to mitigate coronavirus 2019-related
   limitations and impact on medical education. Using audiovisual
   technology, students had the opportunity to participate in clinical
   inpatient and outpatient care, live-streamed procedures, and virtual
   didactics, develop and showcase their clinical knowledge and reasoning
   skills, and become familiar with the culture of the physical medicine
   and rehabilitation residency program. Adaptive educational approaches,
   including integration of the flipped classroom model, success, pitfalls,
   and areas for improvement will be described and discussed. Providing
   nontraditional methods for physical medicine and rehabilitation
   education and exposure to medical students is crucial to maintain and
   promote growth of the field in this unprecedented and increasingly
   virtual era.},

Journal = {APPLIED SCIENCES-BASEL},

Month = {MAY},
Abstract = {Featured Application
   This research shows that identifying, managing, and making visible the
   evidence produced in a Cloud Computing system, while doing collaborative
   work, produces homogeneity in the work load between teams as well as
   among team members.
   Active educational methodologies promote students to take an active role
   in their own learning, enhance cooperative work, and develop a
   collective understanding of the subject as a common learning area. Cloud
   Computing enables the learning space to be supported while also
   revolutionizing it by allowing it to be used as a link between active
   methodology and students' learning activities. A Cloud Computing system
   is used in conjunction with an active methodology to recognize and
   manage individual, group, and collective evidence of the students' work
   in this research. The key hypothesis shown in this work is that if
   evidence management is made clear and evidence is consistently and
   gradually presented to students, their level of involvement will
   increase, and their learning outcomes will improve. The model was
   implemented in a university subject of a first academic year using the
   active Flipped Classroom methodology, and the individual, group and
   collective evidence is constantly worked with throughout the
   implementation of a teamwork method.},

Title = {A Customizable and Incremental Processing Approach for Learning
   Analytics},
Journal = {IEEE ACCESS},
Year = {2020},
Volume = {8},
Pages = {36350-36362},
Abstract = {The ability of learning analytics to improve the learning/teaching
   processes is widely recognized. In this paper, the learning analytics
   architecture developed at the Digital Content Production Center of the
   Technical University of Cartagena (Spain) is presented. This
   architecture contributes to the field of learning analytics in two
   aspects: it allows for dashboard customization and improves the
   efficiency of the analysis of learners interaction data. Events
   resulting from learners interaction are captured and stored in Caliper
   standard format, to be further processed incrementally to allow
   dashboards to be shown without delay to teachers. Customization is
   considered a mandatory requirement for learning analytics tools,
   however, although some proposals have recently been made, a greater
   research effort in this topic is necessary. In the present work, this
   requirement is addressed by defining a domain-specific language (DSL)
   that allows teachers to customize dashboards. This language allows to
   express indicators (logical expressions) that classify students into
   different groups depending on their performance level. The paper also
   shows how our learning analytics approach was evaluated with a course
   that applies a flipped classroom method, and how it compares to the most
   relevant related works that have been published.},

Abstract = {Flipped teaching (FT) has caught educators' attention due to its success
   in engaging students through pre- and in-class activities. To learn if
   FT improved student performance, scores from the quizzes and exams of a
   fully flipped classroom with retrieval exercises were compared with
   those of five semesters of traditional lecture-based {[}unflipped (UF)]
   teaching in an undergraduate sophomore-level physiology course. Student
   attitude surveys were also evaluated. Student performance on both the
   quizzes and exams was significantly higher in the FT class in general
   compared with that of the UF teaching. Interestingly, however, when the
   individual exam scores were compared between the two styles, the scores
   for students in the Fr were significantly higher for exams 2 and 3, yet
   lower for exam 1. The shift in performance from exam 1 to exams 2 and 3
   is likely explained by the need for time to adjust to the new teaching
   style. Students reported an overall positive perception of FT in their
   course evaluations at the end of the semester. In conclusion FT improved
   student performance compared with that of lecture-based traditional
   teaching practice, but required some time to adjust in the beginning of
   the semester.},

   our calculus-based, introductory physics (mechanics) courses at
   California State University, Sacramento. A primarily undergraduate
   institution, our university serves a largely underprivileged student
   population, with one half of students coming from low-income households
   and one third being first-generation college students. We describe our
   setup in detail and analyze data from 13 classes, four instructors, and
   43 learning assistants. We find that (1) learning gains for LA supported
   classes are on average twice as large as our traditionally taught
   classes; (2) learning gains are dependent on pre-test scores; and (3)
   they are also dependent on participation rates. We also analyze student
   and LA responses to end of semester surveys. Two-thirds of the students
   self-report that their study skills have improved from taking the
   LA-supported class, and their comments on course structure are overall
   positive. Over 90\% of the LAs have very positive views of the program,
   and it is especially rewarding to see that 73\% of the LAs who had not
   previously considered teaching as a career became more interested after
   participating in the program.},

Abstract = {This research aims to investigate into the effect of using learning
   analytics (LA)-based process feedback on students' perceptions of
   community of inquiry (teaching, social and cognitive presence) and their
   reflective thinking skills. By using a mixed-method research approach
   (QUAN + qual), this study was conducted as an experimental design with
   the pretest-posttest control group. A total of 104 university students
   who were randomly assigned to the experiment group (EG) and control
   group (CG) were recruited in this study. The procedure was conducted
   within the scope of the computing course based on the flipped classroom
   (FC) model. While the participants in the EG received LA-based process
   feedback which shows their LA results in a weekly manner, those in the
   CG did not get any LA-based process feedback. The data were collected
   through the Community of Inquiry Scale, the Reflective Thinking Scale
   and a semi-structured student opinion form. The findings indicated that
   sending feedback including the students' LA results had a statistically
   significant effect on the students' perceptions of community of inquiry
   and reflective thinking skills. Based on the findings of the study,
   several recommendations for teachers, instructional designers and
   researchers have been made.},

Title = {Modern Didactic Formats in Surgery: A Systematic Review},
Journal = {AMERICAN SURGEON},
Abstract = {Introduction: ``Traditional teaching{''} models often fail to engage
   millennial residents. Multiple modern didactic methods have been
   employed. The most frequently used objective measure to assess the
   effectiveness of didactic formats has been American Board of Surgery
   In-Training Examination performance. Methods: A literature search was
   conducted searching PubMed, EMBASE, and JAMA Network from June 2011 to
   June 2021, in accordance with the PRISMA guidelines. Searches were
   performed for the terms ``ABSITE{''} and ``American Board of Surgery
   In-Training Examination.{''} Only studies discussing didactic structures
   were included. Results: A final 16 studies were included. Modern methods
   such as a ``flipped classroom,{''} Team Based Learning (TBL), and
   ``gamification{''} have all shown increased engagement and significantly
   improved ABSITE performance. Structured biostatistics reviews may be
   used to supplement research and statistics which are often missed by
   other resources. Discussion: Programs have a duty to promote excellent
   resident education. In addition to fostering individual study habits,
   didactics and program structures should be optimized for resident
   development. As opposed to focusing on the pure amount of scheduled
   protected time, programs may instead consider focusing on the quality of
   the didactic format used and modern didactic methods may be beneficial.},

Abstract = {Amateur musical instrument learners are usually taught in a one-to-many
   learning mode owing to the cost consideration; therefore, it is
   difficult for the teacher to address individual students' problems. This
   results in a lack of knowledge internalization. The flipped classroom
   enables the teacher to have more in-class time to interact with
   individual students. However, when the teacher guides a learner in the
   flipped class, the other learners usually practice on their own rather
   than engaging in critical thinking or reflective thinking activities.
   Therefore, this study uses the peer assessment strategy to increase the
   effectiveness of musical instrument flipped teaching. However,
   conventional peer assessment flipped teaching (CPA) has some
   disadvantages. So, we present another method in which the peer
   assessment is performed by online video sharing (VSPA). The VSPA method
   can further extend the learning time until after class. It lets teachers
   have more time to solve the problems of individual students. Besides, it
   can reduce the students' nervousness. The experimental results showed
   that both of the two teaching modes can help progression, but there is
   no significant difference in the learning effectiveness. As for learning
   preference, we found that the learners preferred CPA to VSPA.},

Abstract = {Flipped learning is a didactic method that requires the teacher to have
   a series of competences for its application. The aim of this research is
   to analyse the abilities of Spanish teachers of Compulsory Secondary
   Education (CSE) to develop good practices in flipped learning and to
   discover the factors which influence the development of good practices
   in these teachers. The research method is based on a quantitative
   methodology with a descriptive and correlational design. A total of
   1,743 teachers in Spain participated in the study. The instrument used
   was the Flipped Classroom Teacher Scale (FCTS) questionnaire. The
   results show that 758 teachers, less than half the teachers surveyed,
   show competences to adequately develop a methodology based on flipped
   learning, where age, use of information and communication technologies
   (ICTs) in education, time spent using them in the personal sphere,
   number of devices and teaching experience have an influence on the
   application of the method. The conclusion reached is that there is a
   linear relationship between institutional support, technological
   self-efficacy, teaching beliefs and teaching strategies for the
   development of good practices in flipped learning in the teachers
   analysed, so these factors are postulated as conditioning factors.},

Title = {Developing mental health and addiction competencies in social work
   students using simulation-based learning},
Journal = {SOCIAL WORK EDUCATION},
Abstract = {Social workers are one of the core professionals on the mental health
   workforce and most work with individuals, families, and communities with
   mental health and addiction concerns. Schools of social work have a
   responsibility to adequately prepare students for practice in the field
   of mental health and addictions, but there are gaps in social work
   education and training. This paper describes a social work practice in
   mental health course that has been re-designed to focus on developing
   student competence in mental health, addictions, and suicide risk
   assessment. We formed an advisory committee consisting of faculty, MSW
   and PhD students, as well as community social workers. The re-designed
   course uses simulation-based learning and a form of blended learning
   known as a flipped classroom approach. We developed educational online
   modules that provide opportunities for students to increase knowledge on
   mental health and addictions and give more time to focus on practice in
   the classroom. Simulation-based learning provides students with
   opportunities to practice in the classroom with a simulated client. This
   paper will describe how simulation can be used to teach and assess
   mental health and addiction competencies. We will discuss implications
   for social work education and practice.},

Abstract = {Purpose While teaching of business ethics has been increasing in
   business schools worldwide, universities still face increasing pressure
   to do more to proactively defend and help avoid unethical business
   practices and scandals calling for more responsible education. This
   study aims to examine teaching business ethics in light of recent
   technological advances (i.e. teaching via the use of digital devices)
   and well-established pedagogical practices. Design/methodology/approach
   This study uses a 2 x 2 experimental design examining the effect of
   active (vs passive) and presence (vs absence) of digital devices in
   student learning of 192 US students. Findings The findings suggest that
   the active learning scenario, the usage of laptops and phones helped
   students get higher results in the test compared to active learning with
   no digital devices or passive learning with digital devices.
   Originality/value Active learning practices such as group discussions
   and peer assessment or the flipped classroom approach make a difference
   for business ethics teaching where students need to develop inquiry and
   interest for the subject and engage in ethical dilemmas and real-life
   examples. Further, students in the active learning scenario performed
   better in knowledge tests when they were asked to use their digital
   devices.},

Title = {Remote Anatomic Pathology Medical Student Education in Washington State

Volume = {154},

Abstract = {Objectives: The coronavirus disease 2019 pandemic has halted in-person
   medical student education in many large academic centers, including the
   University of Washington. We identified a unique opportunity to bring
   comprehensive and targeted anatomic pathology training to large numbers
   of medical students who would not receive it otherwise but also need
   credited coursework.
   Methods: We developed a comprehensive 2-week remote-learning course
   encompassing lectures, virtual slides, discussion groups, and unique
   case-based activities. Activities are tailored to the nonpathologist
   future clinician, emphasizing basic microscopy and pathology
   terminology. We employ multiple strategies and technologies to increase
   engagement while distance learning, including screen annotation,
   ``flipped classroom{''} slide presentations, and repetition of common
   themes.
   Results: Given 13 virtual courses to choose between 13\% of students
   enrolled in our course (70 of our 540 rising third- and fourth-year
   students), a nearly 10-fold increase in average pathology rotators.
   Conclusions: This is an unprecedented opportunity to provide tailored
   anatomic pathology instruction, both helping our medical students
   continue training during crisis and illuminating the field of pathology
   for our future colleagues. Preliminary results have been overwhelmingly
   positive regarding understanding of pathology concepts as well as
   attitudes toward pathology.},

Abstract = {The aim of this study is to investigate the effect of students' flipped
   learning readiness (FLR) on engagement, programming self-efficacy,
   attitude towards programming, and interaction intensity in the
   information and technology classrooms where programming is taught with
   the flipped classroom (FC) model. The study group of this research,
   which is designed by the relational screening method, consists of 371
   students studying in middle school. Structural equation model was used
   for the data analysis. The results of the study revealed that FLR and
   its indicators in the programming teaching conducted with the FC model
   are significant predictors of engagement, attitude, programming
   self-efficacy, and interaction intensity. FLR is most strongly related
   to programming self-efficacy, whereas it is most weakly related to
   interaction. The most striking result of this study is that the FC model
   is an effective option in terms of providing engagement, interaction,
   self-efficacy, and learner attitude, which are the key components for
   the success of the instruction. It is thought that this study assists to
   create an awareness on the impact of FLR on students, on subjects that
   frame in-class attitudes, and behaviours of students.},

Abstract = {This article addresses the problem of performance prediction in a
   flipped learning course on digital systems. The course is a part of a
   first-year Engineering degree offered at a public university. The extent
   to which failure at the end of the course can be anticipated is analyzed
   by examining the students' behavior related to academic activities. This
   prediction will be made by considering whether students perform
   different activities as instructed. The timeframe is also limited to the
   early stages of the course. Although anticipating results at early
   stages on the basis of behavioral aspects makes it possible to redress
   the behavior of at-risk students, at the same time, it also introduces
   limitations for potential models. As there are no assessments during the
   early period, no course activity grades will be available for modeling
   purposes. In this study, different data mining techniques will be used,
   which will offer better results. Results will be analyzed in terms of
   the performance of at-risk students and compared with previous research
   studies. Models will also provide information about factors of relevance
   for the academic success of the course.},

Title = {Entrepreneurial thinking: A signature pedagogy for an uncertain 21st
   century},
Journal = {INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF MANAGEMENT EDUCATION},
Year = {2021},
Volume = {19},
Number = {1},

Abstract = {This paper outlines a pedagogical approach for entrepreneurship
   education, with a specific focus on students who do not necessarily
   identify as entrepreneurial. We advance seven essential and teachable
   entrepreneurial thinking skills (ET-7) to form future leaders: (1)
   problem solving, (2) tolerance for ambiguity, (3) failing forward, (4)
   empathy, (5) creativity with limited resources, (6) responding to
   critical feedback, and (7) teamwork approach. ET-7 offers an integrative
   framework that unites previously distinct perspectives of
   entrepreneurial competencies, and outlines how to teach and develop
   these skills in a 12-week mandatory entrepreneurship course through an
   innovative pedagogical approach. This approach to entrepreneurial
   education was built on the concept of a signature pedagogy (Shulman,
   2005) and encompasses three components (i.e., the flipped classroom,
   learning through failure, and access to open educational resources).
   This pedagogical approach to entrepreneurial education supports
   entrepreneurial learning through experiential activities that simulate
   the environment entrepreneurs face. Thus, this paper contributes to the
   literature by outlining the entrepreneurial thinking skillset (ET-7)
   required to be successful in today's modern careers, along with
   considering the methods, tools, and pedagogy that is most likely to
   support ET-7 skill development.},

Title = {The influence of mobile-learning flipped classrooms on the emotional
   learning and cognitive flexibility of students of different levels of
   learning achievement},
Journal = {INTERACTIVE LEARNING ENVIRONMENTS},
Abstract = {As mobile learning (ML) becomes more and more popular, teaching methods
   are gradually adapting to flipped classrooms or micro-flipped
   classrooms. Many studies have discussed the influence of ML-based
   flipped classrooms on students' learning in a macroscopic way. However,
   at the micro-level, the impact of these classrooms on students'
   emotional learning and cognitive flexibility requires further
   research-particularly of students of different levels of learning
   achievement (low, middle, and high). This study, carried out via both
   qualitative and quantitative methods, shows that in learning emotions,
   flipped classrooms based on ML had some effect on students'
   ``self-directed learning{''} and ``self-efficacy.{''} Flipped classrooms
   did more to improve low achievers' intrinsic goals (learning
   motivation), metacognition (learning strategy), and resource management
   (learning strategy) than it did that of middle and high achievers. As
   for cognitive flexibility, results further indicated that flipped
   classrooms allowed low achievers the freedom to be more self-directed,
   helping them to feel a higher degree of ``cognitive control{''} or
   ``cognitive flexibility,{''} thus improving their academic achievement.
   The results of this study lay a theoretical foundation for designing an
   effective flipped classroom environment with differentiated instruction
   in the future.},

Abstract = {Questioning skills are significant competencies that English teachers
   must possess in teaching reading narrative texts. These competencies
   include the ability to create various levels of questions and
   strategies. This study aimed to investigate the teachers' competence in
   making question levels, strategies, and teachers' and students'
   responses during the online flipped classroom learning process. This
   study used a qualitative approach with a content analysis design. The
   data analysis used Barrett's taxonomic percentage, Jacobsen's
   questioning strategy theory, and content analysis through condensation,
   identification, labeling, grouping, verification, and concluding. This
   study revealed that the competence of teachers in making question levels
   and questioning strategies had unique skills. Remarkably, the teachers'
   training background did not wholly affect their competence. However,
   language insight, technology mastery, and question habit dominantly
   influenced their ability to combine the question levels according to the
   questioning strategy. The responses of students taking part in the
   learning provided positive feedback for improving reading comprehension
   skills. The teachers' response stated that this method encourages active
   student engagement in each online teaching session and eases their
   reading comprehension skills. We suggested English teachers improve
   their linguistic understanding, teaching technical skills, and
   strengthen two-way interaction with students through question-and-answer
   sessions.},

Abstract = {Flipped Learning is a rather new approach to teaching. In this approach,
   the place of teacher' s lectures in the classroom and homework
   assignments are exchanged to enhance active learning, engagement, and
   achievement. Flipped learning can be applied for the professional
   development of pre-service and in-service teachers as well. This study
   investigated the effect of flipped professional development on the
   achievement of novice EFL teachers. For this purpose, 150 teachers were
   selected through purposive sampling from different language institutes
   and non-profit educational complexes such as Roshangar and Tazkieh in
   Tehran, District 2. The teachers were divided into experimental and
   control groups. The experimental group was attended the flipped
   classroom, whereas the control group attended traditional lecture-based
   classrooms (equal N=75). Based on the teachers' needs, the course of
   ``Classroom Management{''} was adopted to be taught in 6 weeks.
   ``Farhangyada, ``which is a learning management system, was employed to
   load the required material of the course for the experimental group. An
   instructor taught the content of the course for the control group in the
   traditional way. To collect data, pre-test and post-test were conducted
   to explore teachers' achievement. Results indicated that teachers in the
   flipped professional development performed better than teachers in the
   traditional class.},

Title = {The Brinkmanship Game: Bargaining Under the Mutual Risk of Escalation},
Journal = {JOURNAL OF POLITICAL SCIENCE EDUCATION},
Abstract = {This article describes a simple two-player game which illustrates basic
   concepts of brinkmanship, to include calculations of probability and
   expected outcomes, and risk-taking profiles. The game befits a single
   50-minute class period with introduction, gameplay, and discussion. The
   game can supplement the study of conflict from classic Cold War case
   studies of crisis bargaining, to arms control, or negotiating
   international protocols for global climate change such as the Paris
   Agreement. The Brinkmanship Game was developed for the seventh week of a
   10-week graduate course called Game Theory and Decisionmaking: Exploring
   Strategic Situations. The course features a flipped classroom with class
   time devoted to experimentation, gameplay, and discussion of readings
   and games; lectures are online. The Brinkmanship Game would be
   appropriate for students in any advanced undergraduate or graduate level
   course in international relations, security studies, negotiation, or
   game theory. The Brinkmanship Game provides an active learning
   opportunity that can be valuable for encouraging students to come to
   their own understanding of concepts of mutual risk-taking. The authors
   have found the game to be effective in the classroom and hope it may
   prove valuable to those searching for ways to motivate students and to
   help them learn.},

Abstract = {Flipped classroom models allocate more time for active learning
   approaches compared with more traditional pedagogies, however what is
   less clear with the utilisation of flipped learning is evidence to
   support whether students in flipped classes are given more opportunities
   to develop higher order thinking skills (HOTs) to effect deep learning
   compared with the traditional ways of teaching. Focussing on this gap,
   this study compares on campus and off campus student engagement in two
   courses using different deliveries: online face-to-face (f2f) mixed mode
   (on campus students attend traditional f2f on campus classes and off
   campus students study exclusively online) versus fully online mode,
   utilising flipped classes (all student study off campus engaging in
   flipped virtual classes). Final course grades were similar for both
   deliveries; however, the study suggests flipped classes offered students
   more opportunities to develop HOTs and engage more deeply in the
   learning process. Students' evaluations of the online flipped delivery
   were mixed, with those students previously enrolled exclusively as on
   campus, particularly dissatisfied with fully online delivery and virtual
   class tutor experience. Recommendations are made concerning both the
   timing of the introduction of fully online delivery in a program and the
   need for continual up-skilling of staff who teach in online
   environments.},

Abstract = {Blended learning technique has adapted many new digitized tools to
   facilitate students with flexible and self-phased learning
   opportunities. The flipped classroom strategy, one of the blended
   learning models has been limited by low engagement of students in the
   online component. In the present study, we augment a Flip and Pair
   (F\&P), an active-learning strategy into the blended learning course.
   Following the AB type single group quasi-experimental design, we
   evaluated the effects of F\&P strategy on the student's engagement and
   learning while orchestrating it for an undergraduate engineering physics
   course. Our results highlighted that there is a positive correlation
   between the engagement (computed based on learning logs of TEEL
   (Technology-enhanced and Evidence-based Education and Learning) platform
   in the F\&P activities with that of the performance score (knowledge
   quizzes and final exam). F\&P strategy had a better contribution
   compared to Flip and Traditional Teaching (F\&TT) strategy with respect
   to both engagement and performance. Also, students exhibited a positive
   perception of learning and engagement. Based on our findings, we
   identified the key instructional measures that an instructor can follow
   to increase student engagement while using the F\&P strategy.},

Abstract = {The development of digital strategies in teaching is based on the
   technological progress of the last decades, but also on the strong
   motivation to focus a didactic concept on the learning individuals. The
   available data of German medical faculties indicate that digital
   teaching concepts currently play a subordinate role in medicine in
   general and specifically in otorhinolaryngology. By assessing data of
   our own institution, we could demonstrate that the majority of medical
   students refer mainly to material handed out by the lecturers as single
   source of information for learning Otorhinolaryngology. Therefore, the
   application of sound digital teaching strategies provides special
   chances, in particular in otorhinolaryngology to cope with the excessive
   amount of online information from partly unclear sources.
   Currently, the possible degree of digital teaching reaches from digital
   service supply via punctual provision of classic teaching concepts and
   blended learning up to completely digital curricula. The attractiveness
   of curricular integration of digital teaching strategies is less based
   on the utilization of merely technological progress, but rather on the
   variety of applying innovative curricula and new didactic concepts.
   Depending on the intended teaching purpose, the flipped classroom and
   the virtual reality seem to have a particularly high potential, while
   mobile learning is already established in individual practice. Testing
   and evaluating digital teaching innovations for concrete scenarios
   currently belongs to the most important scientific challenges of digital
   teaching concepts.
   Today, the nationwide implementation of digital teaching in Germany is
   less impeded by technical conditions, but by missing financing because
   sponsoring is currently mainly performed with reference to concrete
   projects; in the context of permanent implementation, however, regular
   costs arise. To support these promising teaching concepts, the
   sponsoring of institutions for digital teaching with provision of
   hard-and software solutions at universities could contribute
   significantly. Establishing cooperation to use such digital platforms
   might lead to a high efficiency regarding the distribution with
   simultaneously profiting of savings potential.},

Abstract = {It is widely recognized that flipped learning has great potential for
   enhancing students' conceptual understanding through the reversed
   arrangement of before-class learning activities and in-class settings.
   However, this approach also raises the challenge of students having to
   obtain the learning content by themselves, especially for abstract
   concepts such as fractions, where students frequently encounter problems
   in mathematics education. In this study, we proposed a gamified
   interactive e-book approach to supporting a flipped mathematics
   classroom. To evaluate the effectiveness of the proposed approach, a
   quasi-experimental study was implemented in an elementary school
   mathematics course. There were three groups: the students who adopted
   the gamified interactive e-book in the mathematical flipped classroom
   (the GIEBFL group), the students who learned with conventional flipped
   learning (the CFL group), and those who learned with traditional
   instruction (the TI group). The results from a paper-and-pencil test
   indicated that the GIEBFL students significantly outperformed the CFL
   and TI students. In addition, the questionnaire of students' learning
   motivation showed that the GIEBFL students had better motivation than
   the CFL and TI students. Also, the GIEBFL students achieved
   significantly higher meta-cognition tendency than the TI students.},

Abstract = {In the Spring of 2020, we launched a rigor and reproducibility
   curriculum for medical students in research training programs. This
   required class consisted of eight, 2-h sessions, which transitioned to
   remote learning in response to the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19)
   epidemic. The class was graded as pass/fail. Flipped classroom
   techniques, with multiple hands-on exercises, were developed for
   first-year medical students (MD/PhD {[}n = 9], Clinical and
   Translational Research Pathway (CTRP) students {[}n = 9]). Four focus
   groups (n = 13 students) and individual interviews with the two
   instructors were conducted in May 2020. From individual interviews with
   instructors and focus groups with medical students, the course and its
   components were favorably reviewed. Students thought the course was
   novel, important, relevant, and practical-and teaching strategies were
   effective (e.g., short lectures, interactive small group exercises, and
   projects). Most students expressed concerns about lack of time for
   course preparation. Sharper focus and streamlining of preparation work
   may be required. Pre- and post-student self-assessments of rigor and
   reproducibility competencies showed average post-scores ranging from
   high/moderate to strong understanding (n = 11). We conclude that rigor
   and reproducibility can be taught to first-year medical students in
   research pathways programs in a highly interactive and remote format.},

Abstract = {Generalizability of the value of methods based on learning analytics
   remains one of the big challenges in the field of learning analytics.
   One approach to testing generalizability of a method is to apply it
   consistently in different learning contexts. This study extends a
   previously published work by examining the generalizability of a
   learning analytics method proposed for detecting learning tactics and
   strategies from trace data. The method was applied to the datasets
   collected in three different course designs and delivery modalities,
   including flipped classroom, blended learning, and massive open online
   course. The proposed method combines process mining and sequence
   analysis. The detected learning strategies are explored in terms of
   their association with academic performance. The results indicate the
   applicability of the proposed method across different learning contexts.
   Moreover, the findings contribute to the understanding of the learning
   tactics and strategies identified in the trace data: learning tactics
   proved to be responsive to the course design, whereas learning
   strategies were found to be more sensitive to the delivery modalities
   than to the course design. These findings, well aligned with
   self-regulated learning theory, highlight the association of learning
   contexts with the choice of learning tactics and strategies.},

Abstract = {COVID-19 has accelerated a reliance on virtual technology for the
   delivery of postgraduate surgical education. We sought to develop a
   regional teaching programme with robust quality assurance. Webinars were
   delivered on a weekly basis by subspecialty experts using Zoom (TM)
   augmented with interactive polling software. Trainee feedback comprised
   Likert item rating on content and delivery, free text comments and
   self-assessed confidence levels using visual analogue scale (VAS)
   scores. A focus group was also convened and transcripts assessed with
   grounded theory analysis. Likert items revealed 442 (93.2\%) positive
   responses regarding content and 642 (96.7\%) positive responses
   regarding trainer delivery. There were statistically significant
   improvements in VAS scores across all programme content. Key themes from
   the focus group analysis were the pragmatics of delivering online
   education, issues surrounding trainer interactivity in the virtual
   world, the identification of the FRCS as a driving factor and a desire
   for case-based content and pre-learning of information (the `flipped
   classroom'). We are continuing to be reactive to trainee feedback in
   developing our online learning programme which will also include a
   regional Moodle-based virtual learning environment (VLE), the subject of
   future educational research in our region. (C) 2020 The British

Abstract = {The use of active methodologies has been configured as an alternative to
   involve and stimulate students in the learning process. In the Federal
   Institute of Ceara, the number of students dropping out and/or learning
   and adaptation difficulties to profile of the student of integrated
   middle courses, instigated to adoption of pedagogical practices that
   sought to more effectively enable these students. Thus, the active
   methodologies became part of daily life of many Geography classes. The
   present work has as general objective to report the main active
   methodologies used in the teaching Geography developed by professors
   from Fortaleza, Umirim and Quixada campuses in the period 2016-2017. For
   the accomplishment of work, we divide it into three stages, namely: 1)
   Literature review; 2) Application of questionnaires, selection of
   methodologies to be used and execution of the same; 3) Systematization
   and analysis of experiences. The most attractive active methodologies
   for the 61 students who participated in the research is: a) Simulated
   jury; b) field classes / technical visits; c) World Coffee; and d)
   Flipped Classroom. So, in the expectation of contributing to the
   adoption of more contextualized and closer to students' understanding,
   the active methodologies became part of the daily life of many of the
   Geography classes.},

Title = {Flipped Teaching with CALL Media in EFL Writing Course: Indonesian EFL
   Writing Teachers' Reflection},
Journal = {PERTANIKA JOURNAL OF SOCIAL SCIENCE AND HUMANITIES},
Year = {2020},

Abstract = {This study was aimed at (1) elaborating the EFL writing teachers'
   perceptions about their experiences after implementing the flipped
   teaching method with CALL (Computer-Assisted Language Learning) in
   teaching EFL (English as a Foreign Language) writing course, (2)
   explaining how flipped teaching with CALL motivates teachers, and (3)
   explaining how flipped teaching with CALL motivates students and
   develops students' autonomous learning. Fifteen Indonesian EFL teachers
   and 150 EFL students from 5 private universities in East Java,
   participated in this case study. The data yielded from this study were
   gathered through reflective teaching journal, in-depth interview, and
   focus group interview, and then, were analyzed descriptively. The
   findings show that there were three main phases of teachers'
   perceptions. First, they were optimistic that flipped teaching would run
   well in their EFL writing class. Second, the teachers' perception
   shifted from having high optimism to caution. Third, the teachers'
   positive perceptions arose after implementing flipped teaching with CALL
   for several meetings. This study also uncovered that the activities of
   flipped teaching could motivate the teachers to implement this method.
   The learning environments, challenging activities created by teachers,
   and the use of technology in the flipped classroom can boost the
   students' motivation and autonomous learning.},

Abstract = {This article presents a pedagogical design for teacher education that
   combines flipped materials, in-class instruction, and telecollaboration
   (also known as virtual exchange) for foreign language teacher education.
   The context of this study is a course on technology and language
   learning for future teachers in which the flipped classroom concept was
   applied to technology-infused collaborative teacher training between
   future ESL/EFL instructors located at two partner universities (one in
   the USA, one in Europe). The three main teaching approaches (flipped
   materials, in class, and telecollaborative, or ``FIT{''}) were symbiotic
   in that each structure reinforced the other through reception,
   discussion, and reflection as a means to help the student teachers
   bridge the gap between theory and practice. We apply classroom
   ethnographic discourse analysis to data sources (face-to-face and online
   discussion groups, student e-portfolios) to look at uptake of ideas,
   conceptual understanding, and successful transfer of new knowledge, and
   thereby identify whether the design provides significant learning
   opportunities for the future teachers. Although most studies of
   telecollaboration in language teacher education look principally at
   output, this approach allows an in-depth look at the learning process as
   knowledge is developed collaboratively between the participants.},

Abstract = {While the development of digital technologies provides generous
   resources for educational practices, how the use of information and
   communication technology (ICT) supports instructional reforms in schools
   still needs further exploration. The purpose of the study is to
   understand the roles of school leaders and teachers play in an
   instructional reform supported by ICT as well as how these roles
   interact with each other. The study selected a Chinese middle-high
   school that successfully had a school-wide instructional reform
   supported by ICT as an exemplary case and collected data through
   document analysis, interviews and observations. The results indicated
   that the school leadership was critical in the instructional reform.
   While the executive vice principal was in an essential position as an
   initiator and strategic planner, the leadership was distributed and
   stretched over in the school. The school built supporting pedagogical
   and organizational systems for continuous and collaborative learning and
   helped the teachers develop four new roles: learners, facilitators to
   student-centered learning, collaborators and researchers.},

Title = {Online supplementation for teaching evidence-based medicine: feasibility
   of a randomised-controlled trial},
Journal = {BMJ EVIDENCE-BASED MEDICINE},
Year = {2021},
Volume = {26},
Number = {5},
Month = {OCT},
Abstract = {Background and Objectives As teaching technology advances, medical
   education is increasingly using digital mediums and exploring
   instructional models such as the flipped classroom and blended learning
   courses, where the in-class taught sessions are more groups on content
   delivered before class. Early evidence suggests lectures and
   foundational material can be equally provided online, but we have
   low-quality research to be convinced. We aim to test and develop an
   online evidence-based teaching resource that seeks to improve the
   availability and scalability of evidence-based medicine (EBM) learning
   tools. We evaluate the feasibility of a study design that could test for
   changes in academic performance in EBM skills using an online
   supplement. Methods Mixed-methods feasibility study of a randomised
   controlled trial (RCT) in an undergraduate medical student cohort.
   Results Of a small cohort (n=34), eight participants agreed to
   randomisation and completed the study. No study participant completed
   the EBM supplementary course in full. Students report time-management as
   a significant barrier in participation, and all aspects of the study and
   communications should be delivered with efficiency a key consideration.
   Conclusion Randomising students to an online EBM supplement within a
   medical school programme presents challenges of recruitment and student
   motivation, but the study design is potentially feasible.},

Abstract = {In order to help promote instructional change at French-speaking
   universities in Europe, we initiated a series of 1-day events centered
   on learning innovations. Since 2015, these events have been taking place
   every 6 months at the Universite Paris Descartes, with the moral support
   of three learned scientific societies, the French Academy of Sciences,
   and sponsoring by leaders in textbook editing and classroom
   technologies. Each event gathers \~{} 40 participants (faculty members,
   postdocs, and educational specialists) from four countries (Belgium,
   France, Luxemburg, Switzerland) and invitees, who share their active
   learning practices, flipped classroom variations representing the most
   popular strategy. Their experience revealed that faculty who invest
   themselves in revamping teaching are still isolated at their
   institutions, although institutional and national support have now been
   gaining momentum. In particular, the role of educational specialists
   (known as ingenieurs pedagogiques in France) is key to help faculty move
   away from lecturing. Overall, our event series illustrates that a
   hands-off approach is effective to foster a cross-border community of
   committed academics in a context where the process of changing the way
   we teach at universities is still in its infancy. (c) 2019 International

Abstract = {This paper describes the planning of a computer-aided design (CAD)
   laboratory for training chemical engineers in graphic expression. The
   CAD laboratory was organised into four projects following a
   project-based learning method. Flipped classroom and contextualised
   learning were used to motivate the students and promote meaningful
   learning. The laboratory mainly focused on engaging the students by
   replicating 2D and 3D plans of common industrial engineering equipment
   and piping and instrumentation diagrams of industrial facilities. Two
   surveys carried out before and after the course showed that the
   student's perception of their graphic expression skills significantly
   increased. Gender differences were observed in self-perceived graphic
   expression skills, particularly in spatial vision. The results showed
   considerable overall satisfaction with the method, scoring a value of
   4.1 +/- 0.9 in the Likert scale (maximum 5). Most of the students
   obtained a score higher than 8 in the CAD laboratory, showing their
   acquisition of specific competences. The results encouraged us to apply
   this method to subsequent courses and to extend training in graphic
   expression to other subjects in the chemical engineering degree. The
   method followed here can easily be extrapolated to other engineering
   disciplines. (c) 2020 Institution of Chemical Engineers. Published by

Title = {Assessment of user experience in video-based learning environments: From
   design guidelines to final product},
Journal = {COMPUTERS \& EDUCATION},
Year = {2021},
Volume = {167},
Month = {JUL},
Abstract = {To provide students with high-quality, tailored content, higher
   education institutions face the challenge of helping their instructors
   produce their own materials. New learning objects are usually assessed
   when students actually use the materials. To improve quality assurance
   in the design of learning objects, this paper proposes systemically
   analyzing the user experience of new learning objects. This involves not
   only considering student feedback, but also integrating other
   perspectives into a continuous feedback loop, through a participatory
   design approach. The proposed framework was tested during the
   implementation of a flipped classroom initiative in a large Chilean
   university over a period of six months, involving 6 content designers, 3
   teachers, 2 teaching assistants and 98 students. We observe how elements
   of feedback are integrated through a systemic assessment, where the end
   result (the learning object) is contrasted with the elements that guided
   its creation (the design guidelines). In this way, the roles of designer
   and user are complemented so as to identify design gaps early on in the
   process of creating a solution. This study adds to the current
   literature by relating design guidelines with the principles of
   instruction during the design process in order to ensure the overall
   quality of the learning objects.},

Title = {Does online teaching strategy matter: exploring the effect of online
   teaching strategies on students' ambidextrous innovation capacities
   based on the online teaching situation in China},
Journal = {JOURNAL OF RESEARCH ON TECHNOLOGY IN EDUCATION},
Abstract = {The coronavirus disease (COVID-19) pandemic stimulated a heated dispute
   about the quality of higher education through online teaching in China.
   Based on constructivism theory and self-regulation theory, this study
   examines the influence of diversified online teaching strategies on
   students' innovation capacities by questionnaire surveys. The sample
   included 367 students from 29 full-time regular universities in the
   mainland, including undergraduate and postgraduate students. The results
   show that online teaching strategies have a significant positive
   association with students' ambidextrous innovation capacities.
   Specifically, the teaching strategies combination constructed by social
   identification strategies and case guidance is conducive to the
   formation of exploitative innovation capacity during online teaching.
   The social participation strategies and flipped classroom are conducive
   to forming the students' exploratory innovation capacity. In further
   research, social participation strategy has a significant positive
   impact on students' ambidextrous innovation capacities for students with
   higher participation willingness. However, social identification
   strategies are helpful for the cultivation of ambidextrous innovation
   capacities for students with lower willingness to participate. Based on
   the empirical results, this study proposes the online teaching
   strategies matrix based on social presence theory and social identity
   theory to provide conducive guidance for improving students' innovation
   capacities.},

Title = {A Call for Reform: Variability and Insufficiency in Radiation Oncology
   Resident Didactics-a Brief Report and National Survey of Program
   Directors},
Journal = {JOURNAL OF CANCER EDUCATION},
Abstract = {An informal needs assessment and lack of a national standardized
   curriculum suggest that there is tremendous variability in the formal
   teaching of radiation oncology resident throughout the USA. The goal of
   this study was to characterize formal radiation oncology resident
   education, in order to identify knowledge gaps and areas for
   improvement. We developed a 14-item survey consisting of the following
   domains: program characteristics, teaching faculty, formal teaching
   time, instructional approaches for formal teaching, curricular topics,
   and satisfaction with didactics. All 91 accredited US-based radiation
   oncology program directors received an invitation to complete the survey
   anonymously by email. Twenty-four (26\% response rate) program directors
   responded. Programs used a variety of instructional methods; all
   programs reported using lecture-based teaching and only a minority using
   simulation (38\%) or flipped classroom techniques (17\%). Other than
   PowerPoint, the most common electronic resource utilized was
   quizzing/polling (67\%), webinar (33\%), and econtour.org (13\%). The
   lack of a national, standardized, radiation oncology residency didactic
   curriculum promotes variability and insufficiency in resident training.
   Themes for improvement were diversity in didactic topics, incorporation
   of evidence-based teaching practices, increased faculty involvement, and
   sharing of resources across programs. Development of a national
   curriculum and increased electronic resource sharing may help address
   some of these areas of improvement.},

Title = {Systematic Review of Effective Library Instruction for Business Students},
Journal = {JOURNAL OF BUSINESS \& FINANCE LIBRARIANSHIP},
Abstract = {The most successful library teaching strategies for post-secondary
   business programs have yet to be determined. The aim of this systematic
   review is to investigate the effectiveness of library instruction (with
   a focus on pedagogy) in business undergraduate and graduate programs.
   The researchers searched seven databases, selected studies that met the
   inclusion criteria, and extracted data following PRISMA guidelines. To
   achieve the study's primary objective, the researchers included any
   library educational intervention in a business program conducted by
   librarians or library staff. The quality of included studies was
   evaluated based on a modified instrument designed to critically appraise
   educational interventions. The instrument consists of nine questions
   that relate to content, context, outcomes, study design, and methods.
   Thirty-five studies met the inclusion criteria and data was extracted
   based on subject area, content coverage, mode of instruction (in-person
   vs virtual), faculty collaboration, assessment strategies, and library
   educational interventions used to teach business students. Common
   educational interventions included hands-on activities, live
   demonstrations, active learning, group work, and lectures. The most
   compelling strategies include active learning, providing engaging
   sessions (e.g., flipped classroom), and faculty collaboration. Since
   most of the studies did not state clear learning outcomes, it is
   difficult to ascertain what type of interventions were truly effective
   in improving library sessions.},

Abstract = {Background: The coronavirus disease-2019 (COVID-19) pandemic forced
   drastic changes in all layers of life. Social distancing and lockdown
   drove the educational system to uncharted territories at an accelerated
   pace, leaving educators little time to adjust.
   Objectives: To describe changes in teaching during the first phase of
   the COVID-19 pandemic.
   Methods: We described the steps implemented at the Technion-Israel
   Institute of Technology Faculty of Medicine during the initial 4 months
   of the COVID-19 pandemic to preserve teaching and the academic
   ecosystem.
   Results: Several established methodologies, such as the flipped
   classroom and active learning, demonstrated effectiveness. In addition,
   we used creative methods to teach clinical medicine during the ban on
   bedside teaching and modified community engagement activities to meet
   COVID-19 induced community needs.
   Conclusions: The challenges and the lessons learned from teaching during
   the COVID-19 pandemic prompted us to adjust our teaching methods and
   curriculum using multiple online teaching methods and promoting
   self-learning. It also provided invaluable insights on our pedagogy and
   the teaching of medicine in the future with emphasis on students and
   faculty being part of the changes and adjustments in curriculum and
   teaching methods. However, personal interactions are essential to
   medical school education, as are laboratories, group simulations, and
   bedside teaching.},

Abstract = {Learning analytics (LA) has emerged as a field that offers promising new
   ways to prevent drop-out and aid retention. However, other research
   suggests that large datasets of learner activity can be used to
   understand online learning behaviour and improve pedagogy. While the use
   of LA in language learning has received little attention to date,
   available research suggests that LA could provide valuable insights into
   task design for instructors and materials designers, as well as help
   students with effective learning strategies and personalised learning
   pathways. This paper first discusses previous CALL research based on
   learner tracking and specific affordances of LA for CALL, as well as its
   inherent limitations and challenges. The second part of the paper
   analyses data arising from the VITAL project that implemented LA in
   different blended or distance learning settings. Statistical and
   process-mining techniques were applied to data from 285 undergraduate
   students on a Business French course. Results suggested that most
   students planned their self-study sessions in accordance with the
   flipped classroom design. Other metrics measuring active online
   engagementindicated significant differences between successful and
   non-successful students' learner patterns. The research implied that
   valuable insights can be acquired through LA and the use of
   visualisation and process-mining tools.},

Abstract = {In an effort to increase student comprehension and retention of basic
   chemistry concepts within a college level general chemistry course, a
   series of activities were created. These activities are referred to here
   as integrated problems. They were developed to help students by
   continuously reviewing key concepts and incorporating new material into
   previous knowledge. In an integrated problems activity, students are
   asked a series of questions related to a chemical reaction. As the
   students work to solve a series of problems, the newer concepts are
   reinforced and previous concepts/ideas are reviewed. For this project,
   the integrated problems were given in the second semester general
   chemistry course but included concepts from both semesters. Three
   different approaches for the inclusion of these integrated problems were
   used within a flipped classroom based on the availability of class time.
   The student's perception of these activities was affected by the method
   these activities were given. A comparison of student perception and
   performance was made between class sections that were given class time
   to do these activities, those who were not, and a section where the
   integrated problems were used as an assessment activity. Plus, students
   who are regularly exposed to these integrated problems may help to
   improve the student's performance in the current course.},

Title = {Developing and evaluating a flipped corpus-aided English pronunciation
   teaching approach for pre-service teachers in Hong Kong},
Journal = {INTERACTIVE LEARNING ENVIRONMENTS},
Abstract = {This study aimed to develop a corpus-aided pronunciation
   teacher-training programme and examine the effectiveness of a
   corpus-aided pronunciation teaching approach in English classrooms in
   Hong Kong. A workshop was conducted for 86 participants to introduce
   several English learner corpora. After the workshop, eight volunteer
   participants, pre-service teachers in Hong Kong, were paired off,
   entered into a seven-stage corpus-aided pronunciation teacher programme
   and attended interviews. One pair was selected to give a trial lesson,
   and 13 primary school students were invited to evaluate this lesson. The
   results revealed that the training provided sufficient knowledge about
   corpus-aided pronunciation teaching and task design. The pre-service
   teachers expressed a strong willingness to use corpus data as examples
   to raise students' awareness of commonly mispronounced sounds. They
   agreed that the flipped instruction component was effective. Of the 13
   primary school students, 83.33\% agreed that they learned how to
   pronounce the target sounds correctly, and 75\% were able to identify
   their mispronounced sounds via the corpus-aided teaching method. The
   findings will not only provide pre-service teachers with examples of
   corpus-aided pronunciation lesson plans and materials but also
   contribute to integrating the flipped classroom approach into teacher
   education programmes.},

Title = {Active Learning in Flipped Life Science Courses Promotes Development of
   Critical Thinking Skills},
Journal = {CBE-LIFE SCIENCES EDUCATION},
Year = {2018},
Volume = {17},
Number = {3},
Month = {SEP 1},
Abstract = {Although development of critical thinking skills has emerged as an
   important issue in undergraduate education, implementation of pedagogies
   targeting these skills across different science, technology,
   engineering, and mathematics disciplines has proved challenging. Our
   goal was to assess the impact of targeted interventions in 1) an
   introductory cell and molecular biology course, 2) an intermediate-level
   evolutionary ecology course, and 3) an upper-level biochemistry course.
   Each instructor used Web-based videos to flip some aspect of the course
   in order to implement active-learning exercises during class meetings.
   Activities included process-oriented guided-inquiry learning, model
   building, case studies, clicker-based think-pair-share strategies, and
   targeted critical thinking exercises. The proportion of time spent in
   active-learning activities relative to lecture varied among the courses,
   with increased active learning in intermediate/upper-level courses.
   Critical thinking was assessed via a pre/posttest design using the
   Critical Thinking Assessment Test. Students also assessed their own
   learning through a self-reported survey. Students in flipped courses
   exhibited gains in critical thinking, with the largest objective gains
   in intermediate and upper-level courses. Results from this study suggest
   that implementing active-learning strategies in the flipped classroom
   may benefit critical thinking and provide initial evidence suggesting
   that underrepresented and first-year students may experience a greater
   benefit.},

Title = {Problem-based learning in a flipped classroom: a case study for active
   learning in legal education in international law},
Journal = {LAW TEACHER},
Abstract = {Higher education in law should develop students' skills such as working
   collaboratively, communicating, and influencing others through critical
   legal reasoning. Traditional legal education is partially based on
   active learning methods, but problem-based learning (PBL) is still
   relatively rare, with a comparatively smaller number of field
   applications reported in available literature, and no reports of its use
   of in legal education in Portugal. This paper describes the application
   of the problem-based learning method to an Erasmus class of
   International Public Law in a Portuguese university, during an academic
   semester. The method was applied to half of the classes, with the
   remaining half being taught using traditional methods. Students'
   perceptions and preferences for the different methods were assessed
   through surveys. In general, our results offer novel insights into the
   effectiveness of PBL, suggesting that student perceptions of the PBL
   method depend on their social skills, previous knowledge of the topics,
   and personal preference. Considering experiences from previous years,
   the teacher's assessment is that using PBL methods allowed for feedback
   and closer follow-up on the students' progress and created the
   opportunity for the development of relevant skills, which would
   otherwise be excluded from the classroom. These results, as well as
   limitations, are discussed.},

Title = {Applying Educational Data Mining to Explore Viewing Behaviors and

Abstract = {In recent years, learning materials have gradually been applied to
   flipped classrooms. Teachers share learning materials, and students can
   preview the learning materials before class. During class, the teacher
   can discuss students' questions from their notes from previewing the
   learning materials. The social media platform Facebook provides access
   to learning materials and diversified interactions, such as sharing
   knowledge, annotating learning materials, and establishing common
   objectives. Previous studies have explored the effect of flipped
   classrooms on students' learning engagement, attitudes, and performance.
   In this paper, we apply educational data mining to explore the
   relationship between students' viewing behaviors in accessing learning
   materials and their performance in flipped classrooms. The participants
   are classified into an experimental group and a control group to engage
   in flipped classroom activities. The experimental group uses the social
   media platform Facebook for flipped learning, and the control group uses
   a learning management system for flipped learning. The results show that
   there is a significant difference in the learning performance between
   the two groups, with the average score of the experimental group being
   higher than that of the control group. Furthermore, we find that the
   viewing behaviors and performance of the students within the
   experimental group differ significantly.},

Title = {Enhancing generic capabilities and metacognitive awareness of first-year
   nursing students using active learning strategy},
Journal = {BMC NURSING},
Year = {2021},

Abstract = {Background Developing students' generic capabilities is a major goal of
   university education as it can help to equip students with life-long
   learning skills and promote holistic personal development. However,
   traditional didactic teaching has not been very successful in achieving
   this aim. Kember and Leung's Teaching and Learning Model suggests an
   interactive learning environment has a strong impact on developing
   students' generic capabilities. Metacognitive awareness is also known to
   be related to generic capability development. This study aimed to assess
   changes on the development of generic capabilities and metacognitive
   awareness after the introduction of active learning strategy among
   nursing students. Methods This study adopted a quasi-experimental single
   group, matched pre- and posttest design. It was conducted in a school of
   nursing at a university in Hong Kong. Active learning approaches
   included the flipped classroom (an emphasis on pre-reading) and enhanced
   lectures (the breaking down of a long lecture into several mini-lectures
   and supplemented by interactive learning activities) were introduced in
   a foundational nursing course. The Capabilities Subscale of the Student
   Engagement Questionnaire and the Metacognitive Awareness Inventory were
   administered to two hundred students at the start (T0) and at the end of
   the course (T1). A paired t-test was performed to examine the changes in
   general capabilities and metacognitive awareness between T0 and T1.
   Results A total of 139 paired pre- and post-study responses (69.5 \%)
   were received. Significant improvements were observed in the critical
   thinking (p < 0.001), creative thinking (p = 0.03), problem-solving (p <
   0.001) and communication skills (p = 0.04) with the implementation of
   active learning. Significant changes were also observed in knowledge of
   cognition (p < 0.001) and regulation of cognition (p < 0.001) in the
   metacognitive awareness scales. Conclusions Active learning is a novel
   and effective teaching approach that can be applied in the nursing
   education field. It has great potential to enhance students' development
   of generic capabilities and metacognitive awareness.},

Abstract = {The present article aims to present the methodological strategies used
   in the compulsory discipline ``School, Curriculum and Diversity{''} of
   the Professional Master in Education of the University of Taubate in the
   years 2017 and 2018, based on its curricular design, establishing an
   analysis with the evaluation end of the course. This study shows the
   participation of 66 masters students, 45 in 2017, distributed in two
   classes, one with 21 students and the other with 24, and 21 students in
   the year 2018. The course, composed of 15 weeks of classes, had its
   preparatory material made available on two different digital platforms:
   Google Drive in 2017 and Cuboz Social Network in 2018. All classes were
   organized from Flipped Classroom, whereby students should read texts and
   other recommended materials, answer the questions in an electronic form
   and send it before class. The classes took place through the use of
   participative methodologies, through which the students could share
   doubts, learning and build knowledge. The data presented here
   demonstrate that curricular organization and methodological
   diversification contribute to: (i) the organization of work, (ii) the
   development of study autonomy for beginning masters, (iii) the group's
   interaction and participation in the proposed themes; (iv) the analysis
   of the subjects and their correlation with the research themes.},

Abstract = {Advanced technology has provided new opportunities for its application
   in the education field, creating new learning environments to suit the
   changing environment and learning requirements of learners. Many studies
   focused on users' performance after the implementation of the
   technology, and less attention was placed on identifying and solving the
   challenges and issues faced by users during the implementation of these
   technologies. In order to explore these issues raised and challenges
   faced during the implementation process of technologies in the
   classroom, seven professors who are experts in the field of educational
   technology were interviewed during conferences and events of the IEEE
   Technical Committee on Learning Technology during 2015-2016. Through the
   expert's lenses, this paper analyzes the experience shared by these
   experts in implementing and utilizing new innovative technologies in
   classrooms, including four recently prevalent innovative concepts and
   learning environments, i.e., collaborative learning, game-based
   learning, mobile learning, flipped classroom, and seamless learning.
   This paper further explores on the potential challenges and issues one
   would face when integrating new innovative technologies in a classroom
   from the perspective of different users' groups (i.e., learners,
   teachers/educators, schools/universities, developers and researchers),
   along with a discussion on the potential and development of two future
   learning environments.},

Title = {Novel Approach to Introducing an Ultrasonography Curriculum With Limited

Abstract = {Context: Ultrasonography is becoming more prevalent in clinical
   practice, but medical schools looking to implement preclinical training
   are limited by financial and faculty resources.
   Objective: To design a single-instructor model to save faculty resources
   and to determine whether this model is effective at teaching
   ultrasonography to preclinical medical students.
   Methods: This single-instructor model included 3 components: (1) flipped
   classroom, where students watched an online lecture covering examination
   techniques; (2) in-person scanning sessions, where students scanned each
   other after the instructor went through lecture content and pathologic
   images, a video camera to show probe placement and examination
   technique, and a live feed from an ultrasonography demonstration; and
   (3) feedback on written examination questions and course evaluations.
   Results: When compared with a traditional ultrasonography curriculum,
   which requires approximately 600 instruction hours annually, this
   program required 96 hours. Students reported appreciation of exposure to
   ultrasonography but expressed desire for smaller group sizes and greater
   individual instruction. Students performed well on written test
   questions, with the first-year class answering 88\% correctly and the
   second-year class answering 90.6\% correctly.
   Conclusions: Although this educational format was used successfully to
   teach introductory ultrasonography to preclinical students, feedback
   suggested that students would prefer more individual instruction. The
   authors look toward implementing a peer-instructor format, forming
   smaller laboratory groups, and improving skill assessment.},

Title = {Interventions to Reduce Burnout and Improve Resilience: Impact on a
   Health System's Outcomes},
Journal = {CLINICAL OBSTETRICS AND GYNECOLOGY},
Year = {2019},
Volume = {62},

Abstract = {With the continuously changing health care environment and dramatic
   shift in patient demographics, institutions have the responsibility of
   identifying and dedicating resources for maintaining and improving
   wellness and resilience among front line providers to assure the quality
   of patient care. Our institution, the Ohio State University Wexner
   Medical Center (OSUWMC), has addressed the goal to decrease burnout for
   providers in a multistep, multiprofessional, and multiyear program
   starting firstly with institutional cultural change then focused
   provider interventions, and lastly, proactive resilience engagement. We
   describe herein our approach and outcomes as measured by provider
   wellness and health system outcomes. In addition, we address the overall
   feasibility and effectiveness of these programs in promoting provider
   compassion and mindfulness while reducing burnout and improving
   resilience. Institutional culture change and readiness were initiated in
   2010 with the introduction of Crew Resource Management training for all
   providers across the OSUWMC. This multiyear program was implemented and
   has been sustained to the current day. Focused interventions to improve
   mindfulness were undertaken in the form of both Mindfulness in Motion
   (MIM) training for intensive care unit personnel and a ``flipped
   classroom{''} mindfulness training for faculty and residents. Lastly,
   sustainable changes were introduced in the form of the Gabbe Health and
   Wellness program which consists of interprofessional MIM training and
   other wellness offerings for staff, faculty, and residents embedded
   across the entire medical center. The introduction of Crew Resource
   Management in 2010 continues to be endorsed and supported throughout
   OSUWMC for all providers, including residents and students. The
   improvements seen have not only improved patient satisfaction but also
   reduced patient safety events and improved national reputation for the
   institution as a whole. Subsequently, MIM training for intensive care
   unit providers has resulted in improved resilience as well as decreased
   patient safety events. In addition, the ``flipped classroom{''}
   mindfulness training for residents and faculty has resulted in
   improvements in providing calm and compassionate care, improvements in
   physician wellbeing, and reductions in emotional exhaustion and
   depersonalization. Lastly, implementing the Gabbe Health and Wellness
   program inclusive of interprofessional MIM training for staff, faculty,
   and residents has resulted in significant reductions in burnout while
   significantly increasing resilience postintervention. The engagement
   from staff and enthusiasm to continue this program have escalated and
   been positively accepted across OSUWMC. To reduce the incidence of
   burnout, improve resilience, and ultimately improve patient outcomes, a
   health system must identify and prioritize a commitment and dedication
   of resources to develop and sustain a multimodal and interprofessional
   approach to change. These initiatives at OSU originated with cultural
   transformation allowing the acceptance of change in the form of
   mindfulness training, resilience building, and the engagement of
   organizational science, so as to demonstrate the outcomes and impact to
   the health system and academic peers. Herein we describe the work that
   has been done thus far, both published and in progress, to understand
   our journey.},

Abstract = {As a result of the global pandemic caused by COVID-19, universities have
   carried out teaching in a digital way, accelerating the inclusion and
   use of technologies in methodological adaptation. The research aims to
   ascertain the perception that students at the Faculty of Education
   Sciences of the University of Granada have regarding the pedagogical
   model adopted in the virtual learning environment during confinement
   through the second semester of the 2019-2020 academic year. The
   information collection method was an online questionnaire, using simple
   random sampling with proportional affixing 0.5, 95\% confidence level
   and maximum permissible error of 4.7\%. The results demonstrate a
   generalised dissatisfaction of the students, being fundamental to carry
   out the transition of the educational processes and training of the
   teaching staff. The implementation of active methodologies increases due
   to the virtual condition, specifically the flipped classroom
   methodology, but students manifest generalised dissatisfaction regarding
   the adequate methodological development and the involvement of
   professors. There is an outstanding use of e-mail and the virtual
   learning platform (PRADO), although they consider that they do not have
   the appropriate knowledge about image editors, video, computer graphics,
   synchronous response systems and anti-plagiarism tools. The students
   surveyed express that the tutoring functions, tasks and beliefs of the
   teaching staff in e-learning are not satisfactory.},

Abstract = {Course-based undergraduate research experiences (CURE) are a valuable
   tool to increase research exposure for larger undergraduate cohorts. We
   implemented a CURE within a senior-level biofluid mechanics course that
   was primarily taught using a flipped classroom approach. Due to the
   large class size, the students analyzed data that was publicly available
   and produced by one of our laboratories. Student teams then developed
   hypotheses based on the data analysis and designed a set of in vitro and
   in vivo experiments to test those hypotheses. The hypotheses and
   experiments that were most highly rated by the class were then tested in
   our laboratory. At the end of the class, student gains were assessed by
   self-report and compared to those self-reported by students engaging in
   a traditional freshman undergraduate summer research experience. While
   the students in the CURE reported moderate gains in self-assessment of
   research-based skills, their selfreported gains were statistically
   significantly lower than those reported by students who participated in
   the traditional research experience. We believe that the CURE could be
   improved through implementation in a lower level class, enabling
   students to observe laboratory experiments, and providing additional
   feedback throughout the hypothesis development and experimental design
   process. Overall, the CURE is an innovative way to expand research
   experiences, in particular for engineering students who often do not
   participate in hypothesis-driven research during their undergraduate
   education.},

Abstract = {The importance of advancing the `employability skills' of students
   throughout their undergraduate education has been increasingly
   recognised by students and university instructors. Development of these
   essential skills is hindered by the lack of widely available assessment
   tools and shortage of detailed descriptions of effective instructional
   strategies. Evidence supports use of active learning in small groups for
   advancement of several transferable soft skills, including teamwork,
   critical-thinking and problem-solving skills (PSS). In this study, a
   previously reported testing strategy was used to measure the progress of
   generic PSS of students taking a one-semester, final-year undergraduate
   biochemistry course. Mixed-mode delivery based on a `flipped classroom'
   approach allowed introduction of significant active learning components,
   including problem-based learning (PBL) in small teams (seven-eight
   students), workshops, bonus testing and lectures. Detailed descriptions
   of the instructional techniques used together with the Covid-19
   pandemic-forced transition to fully online tutor-less PBL are provided.
   Data collected over two consecutive years demonstrate statistically
   significant improvement in the PSS test scores for the 89 students
   taking this course. Marks of students obtained in three different
   assessments (examinations, peer evaluations and PSS tests) are compared,
   revealing medium to low correlation. The benefits resulting from
   introducing active learning techniques and multiple assessments in
   undergraduate classes are discussed.},

   Contributing and Constraining Factors},

Abstract = {Background With medical education shifting towards competency-based
   models, medical students are expected to be self-directed lifelong
   learners. There is an urgent need to understand what technology students
   adopt for self-directed learning and what factors contributed to
   students' self-initiated technology use. Method This study took place in
   a midwestern university medical school, which implements a flipped
   classroom model where students are required to learn all the course
   materials independently before class. Twenty-six first- and second-year
   medical students participated in a semi-structured interview about their
   self-directed learning with technology, and contributing factors towards
   technology use. A qualitative description methodology using thematic
   analysis was used to identify key themes from the interview data.
   Results Medical students reported using four types of technologies for
   learning video resources, self-assessment tools, management tools, and
   social media. Three key determinants of students' self-directed
   technology use were identified, including perceived usefulness,
   subjective norms, and educational compatibility. Conclusions By probing
   medical students' self-initiated technology use and its determinants,
   this study suggested that in a self-directed learning environment,
   medical students used a variety of third-party resources to facilitate
   learning and develop self-directed learning skills. This study also
   provided important practical implications to better support students'
   productive use of technologies for self-directed learning.},

Abstract = {Monitoring students in Learning Management Systems (LMS) throughout the
   teaching-learning process has been shown to be a very effective
   technique for detecting students at risk. Likewise, the teaching style
   in the LMS conditions, the type of student behaviours on the platform
   and the learning outcomes. The main objective of this study was to test
   the effectiveness of three teaching modalities (all using Online
   Project-based Learning -OPBL- and Flipped Classroom experiences and
   differing in the use of virtual laboratories and Intelligent Personal
   Assistant -IPA-) on Moodle behaviour and student performance taking into
   account the covariate ``collaborative group{''}. Both quantitative and
   qualitative research methods were used. With regard to the quantitative
   analysis, differences were found in student behaviour in Moodle and in
   learning outcomes, with respect to teaching modalities that included
   virtual laboratories. Similarly, the qualitative study also analysed the
   behaviour patterns found in each collaborative group in the three
   teaching modalities studied. The results indicate that the collaborative
   group homogenises the learning outcomes, but not the behaviour pattern
   of each member. Future research will address the analysis of
   collaborative behaviour in LMSs according to different variables
   (motivation and metacognitive strategies in students, number of members,
   interactions between students and teacher in the LMS, etc.).},

Abstract = {The technological advances undertaken in the educational field have
   promoted distance education as an option with a significant increase in
   the number of institutions and students that opt for this modality.
   Evidently, the rapid and continuous appearance of technological
   resources that are being integrated into the educational context in all
   corners of the world implies a constant effort in its adaptation to
   ensure that the teaching-learning process is effective and adequate to
   the new contexts. Blended learning has been Consolidated as an
   educational modality that is revolutionizing distance education and has
   been enriched with new technological resources and innovative
   methodological proposals, overcoming obstacles and making progress in
   new possibilities that guarantee the quality of blended education. In
   this sense, the contributions of international experts on blended
   learning are presented in this work. These contributions, which are
   based on in-depth knowledge and analysis of the scientific literature
   and the research focused on this teaching modality, offer experiences
   and practices enriched with technologies and emerging methodologies such
   as augmented reality, electronic rubrics, gamification and the flipped
   classroom, among others. These experiences and practices propose an
   educational modality adapted to the needs of a teacher who seeks new
   ways of achieving efficiency in their teaching activity and of a student
   body that expects educational institutions to respond appropriately to
   their training needs.},

Title = {Learning to teach 3D printing in schools: how do teachers in Korea
   prepare to integrate 3D printing technology into classrooms?},
Journal = {EDUCATIONAL MEDIA INTERNATIONAL},
Year = {2018},
Volume = {55},
Number = {3},
Pages = {183-198},
Abstract = {3D printing implementation in educational contexts has gained
   considerable attention in recent years. However, research shows that
   both in-service and pre-service teachers lack digital literacy and the
   confidence required to teach this emerging technology. This study
   reports the current challenges and opportunities in 3D printing
   education in Korea and identifies the range of knowledge required for
   teachers to integrate 3D printing technology into classrooms in
   meaningful ways. The technological, pedagogical, and content knowledge
   (TPACK) framework was used to analyze the certificate program for 3D
   printing educators and in-service teachers' practices. The findings from
   interviews with 10 in-service teachers and participant observation in
   the 3D printing training workshop for pre-service teachers revealed that
   technological knowledge is overly emphasized in the 3D printing teacher
   training curriculum. Thus, many in-service teachers develop their
   content knowledge and pedagogical knowledge by exchanging ideas with
   other teachers online and running project-based courses with flipped
   classroom approaches. Two potential paths were discovered for developing
   curricula that cross over the domains of the TPACK framework to
   successfully integrate the technology into classrooms: collaboration
   between teachers in different subject areas and industry experts to
   develop technical knowledge and curriculum, and contextualizing 3D
   printing technology in relation to open-source digital culture.},

Abstract = {Encouraging the use of active-learning methodologies, both inside and
   outside the classroom by means of planned activities, is a key factor in
   effective learning, as well as being essential for students to achieve
   the goals set for each subject by making them responsible for their own
   learning. In this longitudinal and quantitative study, we describe the
   different active learning activities, such as Flipped Classroom, Design
   Thinking, Visual Thinking, and Project-Based Learning (PBL), undertaken
   from 2015 to 2018 in the compulsory subject Graphic Expression imparted
   during the first year from all the degree studies of the Escola
   d'Enginyeria de Barcelona Est from Universitat Politecnica de
   Catalunya-UPC BarcelonaTech. The introduction of active-learning
   teaching methodologies for the solving of problems with computer aided
   design throughout the course, with increasing complexity of exercise
   completion, has led to a significant improvement in academic results by
   students in this subject. The results show that the inclusion of these
   methodologies improves student learning, as seen through the group
   development of an engineering project presented on the conclusion of the
   course. PBL is the methodology that is most highly appreciated by
   students because it enables them to integrate all the skills and
   knowledge acquired throughout the course and is also the activity in
   which they obtain the best marks.},

Abstract = {Physical chemistry students often have negative perceptions and low
   expectations for success in physical chemistry, attitudes that likely
   affect their performance in the course. Despite the results of several
   studies indicating increased positive perception of physical chemistry
   when active learning strategies are used, a recent survey of faculty in
   the U.S. revealed the continued prevalence of instructor-centered
   approaches in physical chemistry. In order to reveal a deeper
   understanding of student experiences in an active learning physical
   chemistry course, we present a phenomenological study of students'
   perceptions of physical chemistry when the course is completely
   redesigned using active learning strategies. Using the flipped
   classroom, an active learning space, cooperative learning, and
   alternative assessments, we emphasized fundamental concepts and
   encouraged students to take responsibility for their learning. Based on
   open-ended surveys and interviews with students, we found that students
   struggled with the transition, but had some significant positive
   perceptions of the approach. This is in agreement with previous studies
   of physical chemistry courses in which cooperative learning was the
   focus. As part of a larger study of the effectiveness of this course
   redesign, we show how students perceive the effectiveness of these
   strategies and how they react to them. In addition, we discuss the
   implications of these findings for the active learning physical
   chemistry classroom.},

Abstract = {For many years, educators at all levels have been trying to revamp their
   teaching styles to optimize the learning process. The availability of
   new virtual and technical instructional tools has led to significant
   increase in research in teaching methodologies whose outcome can be
   split into three categories: (1) lecture delivery, e.g. flipped
   classroom; (2) interactivity, e.g. instantaneous gathering of students'
   feedback; and (3) technology in the classroom, e.g. using clickers and
   other gadgets. The focus of this article is on the latter; particularly,
   the use of technology in teaching concepts that are hard to grasp by
   mechanical engineering students. These include electromagnetism,
   semiconductors, design, controls, and system dynamics. The work
   presented here is based on data collected from activities with 14th and
   11th graders, college sophomores, and seniors. The activities include
   two-week long Science, Technology, Engineering and Mathematics course
   and a regular semester long mechanical engineering technical elective. A
   remarkable level of engagement and participation was observed from the
   students which led to the successful design and construction of
   interesting devices and systems which earned them recognition by their
   colleagues, administrators, and industry visitors. In addition, the
   student enrollment in the mechanical engineering program has increased
   by 44\% since the start of the Science, Technology, Engineering and
   Mathematics event for high school students in 2013.},

Abstract = {Flipped classes are well-known for reversing the typical in-class
   lecture and out-of-class homework structure by instructing students to
   learn by themselves from on-line learning materials and inviting them to
   ask questions based on their individual difficulties in class. Many
   attempts at integrating this teaching method into English as a foreign
   language (EFL) classrooms have proven to be beneficial to students'
   learning achievement and motivation. However, there is little research
   on how to organize interactive, engaging and effective in-class
   activities for an EFL flipped classroom. In this study, a student
   response system (SRS) is proposed to support teachers in organizing
   in-class activities in a flipped class. To investigate the effectiveness
   of this approach, a quasi-experiment was conducted in an EFL classroom
   in an engineering school. The experimental group used the SRS to do
   in-class activities while the control group followed the conventional
   method. The results showed that the use of the SRS increased students'
   learning motivation and self-efficacy in learning English grammar and
   improved their participation and engagement in the in-class activities
   of the flipped learning process. Furthermore, the questionnaire results
   showed that students accepted the SRS as an instructional method in an
   EFL flipped class. However, the use of the SRS was not effective in
   improving students' grammar learning achievement.},

Abstract = {Radiation education is necessary for a wide variety of people, such as
   radiation workers particularly for students of secondary school and
   higher education institution who learn radiation sciences. The fact that
   we could not see or feel radiation makes it difficult to understand it.
   The use of radiation trajectories shown on a personal computer should be
   useful to overcome this difficulty. In order to understand radiation
   behaviour inside the material, we have developed a Simu-Rad (Copyright:
   L Y2018002738) by using Monte Carlo simulation programme One who has no
   programming knowledge is able to simulate photons in a material through
   the developed programme The program could become a computer aided
   learning tool for radiation related courses. We aim to facilitate
   lecturer from `The Traditional Classroom' to `The Flipped Classroom' for
   radiation education concerning in the era of IR 4.0. To validate our
   radiation simulator, we calculate photon linear attenuation coefficient
   (mu) of an aluminium material which commonly used as a filter in
   diagnostic radiology. mu is one of the main characteristics to
   understand how the radiation attenuated inside the materials. We
   calculate at energy photon of 662 keV (Cs-137 radiation source) to
   compare our results of mu with the XCOM database. Consequently, the
   results from the developed simulator comparable with the database
   verified our programme to be used for radiation study.},

Abstract = {In the area of Information and Communication Technologies, in addition
   to the problem of engagement, students often have difficulties in
   learning subjects related to modeling and programming. The reasons for
   these difficulties are well known and described in the literature,
   pointing to difficulties in abstraction and logic thinking. Knowing that
   the value of flexible and personalized learning, teachers are changing
   the way they teach, using different active learning methodologies, such
   as flipped classroom, project-based learning, and peer instruction. This
   paper describes an experiment conducted to improve the learning
   experiences of the students enrolled in the Computer Science bachelor's
   degree course, attending three curricular units: Information Systems
   Development, Data Structures, and Web Languages and Technologies. The
   approach followed by the teachers used project-based learning as an
   active learning methodology. This methodology allows us to achieve four
   main objectives: (i) improve student engagement; (ii) improve learning
   outcomes achievement (iii) increase the course success rate and (iv)
   allow students to experience the need for the software development
   lifecycle, feeling that software engineering is not a block-based
   process but depending on previous activity, often leads to the need to
   go back in the process. The results obtained with the use of the active
   methodology were well accepted by the students and allowed both teachers
   and students to reach the objectives set.},

Abstract = {Students learning a new language are aided by the use of a voice
   assistant when practicing speech, as it allows them to intensify their
   independent studies and master the elementary level of a foreign
   language. Moreover, the didactic potential of the Russian voice
   assistant ``Alice{''} has hardly been studied in the context of teaching
   a foreign language at the university level. The purpose of this study is
   to test the effectiveness of educational interactions between students
   who are mastering a beginner level of Russian as a foreign language at
   university with the aid of the voice assistant ``Alice{''}. This study
   involved foreign students of the Peoples' Friendship University of
   Russia. The observation method allowed us to determine five educational
   functions of ``Alice{''} while studying a foreign language and five
   scenarios of educational interaction students had with ``her{''} in the
   process of their independent study. The flipped classroom model was
   selected to implement the proposed scenarios. The effectiveness of these
   educational interactions is confirmed by the results of the exam, which
   tested whether students meet the requirements for a beginner level of
   proficiency in Russian as a foreign language. After the exam, foreign
   students left positive feedback about working with ``Alice{''}. The
   results of the study indicate the didactic potential of the Russian
   voice assistant for those studying Russian at a university as an
   international student.},

Title = {Using the ``Hallmarks of Cancer{''} as a framework for medical students
   and clinicians to understand oncogenesis},
Journal = {ADVANCES IN PHYSIOLOGY EDUCATION},
Year = {2021},
Volume = {45},
Number = {1},
Pages = {1-4},
Month = {JAN},
Abstract = {Two landmark reviews in 2000 and 2011, describing the ``Hallmarks of
   Cancer{''}, provided a new and valuable framework for understanding the
   process of oncogenesis as a progressive accumulation of characteristics,
   each characteristic essential for a tumor to become a clinically
   relevant, metastatic neoplasia. The process of oncogenesis is
   conceptually important for physicians, both for clinical reasons, and
   for their engagement in oncological research. However, these reviews are
   written for specialists in the field, which presents barriers for novice
   learners. Therefore, to allow students, and also clinicians external to
   the oncological field, to access this valuable framework for
   understanding oncogenesis, we have created a condensed summary of the
   original reviews. Our institutions use a ``flipped{''} approach to the
   large-group components of our preclinical education. We have
   successfully used our Hallmarks of Cancer summary as the prework for
   sessions on oncogenesis for five years at one institution, and nine
   years at the other, typically at the end of cancer blocks within
   integrated, multidisciplinary courses. We report here survey results
   indicating learners strongly appreciate the summary as both preparation
   material for participation in relevant flipped classroom sessions, and
   as a general review of oncogenesis. This condensed summary of the
   original Hallmarks of Cancer reviews makes many of the key concepts of
   oncogenesis available to medical students in their preclinical years, as
   well as to physicians outside the field of oncology.},

Title = {Emergency remote teaching and students' academic performance in higher
   education during the COVID-19 pandemic: A case study},
Journal = {COMPUTERS IN HUMAN BEHAVIOR},
Year = {2021},
Volume = {119},
Month = {JUN},
Abstract = {The COVID-19 pandemic has caused a massive disruption in the way
   traditional higher education institutions deliver their courses. Unlike
   transitions from face-to-face teaching to blended, online or flipped
   classroom in the past, changes in emergency remote teaching ?a temporary
   shift of instructional delivery to an alternate remote delivery mode due
   to crisis circumstances? happen suddenly and in an unplanned way. This
   study analyzes the move to emergency remote teaching at the School of
   Telecommunication Engineering (Universidad Polite?cnica de Madrid), and
   the impact of organizational aspects related to unplanned change,
   instruction-related variables ?class size, synchronous/asynchronous
   delivery? and use of digital supporting technologies, on students?
   aca-demic performance. Using quantitative data of academic records
   across all (N = 43) courses of a bachelor?s degree programme in
   Telecommunication Engineering and qualitative data from a questionnaire
   delivered to all (N = 43) course coordinators, the research also
   compares the academic results of students during the COVID-19 pandemic
   with those of previous years. The results of this case study show an
   increase in students? academic performance in emergency remote teaching,
   and support the idea that organizational factors may contribute to
   successful implementation of emergency remote teaching; the analysis
   does not find differences across courses with different class sizes or
   delivery modes. The study further explores possible explanations for the
   results of the analysis, considering organizational, individual and
   instruction-related aspects.},

Title = {Forced migration to online classes: a case study in Music teacher
   education in the context of COVID-19},
Journal = {REVISTA ELECTRONICA DE LEEME},
Year = {2021},
Number = {48},
Pages = {175-192},
Abstract = {As an emergency measure in response to the pandemic produced by
   COVID-19, most of the universities in the world had to close their
   campuses and reschedule their activities. Although official statistics
   indicate that practically all the institutions continued with their
   learning activities, responsibility for didactic and curricular
   modifications fell on the teachers who had been giving classes in
   face-to-face formats and who had no experience in teaching in online
   formats. This forced migration meant that the universities were able to
   continue training students on a more or less regular basis; however, the
   official statistics that speak of approval rates do not account for the
   effectiveness of learning in this new format. The combination of a case
   study in a career in music pedagogy at a PLACE and an investigation of
   grounded theory design seeks to describe, substantiate, and evaluate the
   modifications made to the different subjects from the teacher's point of
   view, visualize the difficulties they had during the period, and reflect
   on the effectiveness and projection of online teaching in musical
   disciplines. Our results point to a great diversity of modifications,
   highlighting several related to Active Methodologies, such as Project
   based Learning and the Flipped Classroom. They also report a feeling of
   significant work overload and a perception that learning is diminished
   in online contexts compared to face-to-face ones.},

   Higher Education},
Journal = {FRONTIERS IN PSYCHOLOGY},
Year = {2021},
Volume = {12},
Month = {FEB 18},
Abstract = {In order for higher education to provide students with up-to-date
   knowledge and relevant skillsets for their continued learning, it needs
   to keep pace with innovative pedagogy and cognitive sciences to ensure
   inclusive and equitable quality education for all. An adequate
   implementation of flipped learning, which can offer undergraduates
   education that is appropriate in a knowledge-based society, requires
   moving from traditional educational models to innovative pedagogy
   integrated with a playful learning environment (PLE) supported by
   information and communications technologies (ICTs). In this paper, based
   on the design-based research, a task-driven instructional approach in
   the flipped classroom (TDIAFC) was designed and implemented for two
   groups of participants in an undergraduate hands-on making course in a
   PLE. One group consisting of 81 students as the experimental group (EG)
   received flipped learning instruction, and another group of 79 students
   as the control group (CG) received lecture-centered instruction. The EG
   students experienced a three-round study, with results from the first
   round informing the customized design of the second round and the second
   round informing the third round. The experimental results demonstrated
   that students in the EG got higher scores of summative tests and final
   scores than those in the CG. In particular, students' learning
   performance in three domains (i.e., cognitive, affective, and
   psychomotor) differ significantly between the two groups.},

Abstract = {Background: Inequalities in healthcare are increasing. Engaging medical
   students to tackle this urgent challenge alongside clinical sciences can
   be demanding. This study examines medical student perceptions of a
   flipped approach to health inequalities co-designed by faculty and
   sixth-year students.
   Innovation: A flipped learning session was piloted for year 4 medical
   students combining an online lesson followed by a tutorial with a
   simulated patient.
   Methods: A mixed-methods approach collected questionnaire data using
   4-point Likert scales and free text answers. A semi-structured group
   interview was conducted with six voluntary participants.
   Results: Two hundred and eighty-nine students completed questionnaires.
   85\% (n = 246) completed the online lesson. Students agreed the session
   helped their understanding of key concepts (mean 3.2), was improved by
   having an actor (mean = 3.6), and was enjoyable (mean = 3.2). Thematic
   analysis of qualitative questionnaire and interview data revealed three
   themes: engagement; structure; and attitudes towards social determinants
   of health. The simulation increased clinical relevance and students
   gained understanding of the impact of health inequalities upon
   individuals.
   Conclusions: This paper indicates flipped learning can increase clinical
   relevance and engagement in population health and person-centered care.
   Further work could assess changes in practice and attitudes of future
   doctors in tackling such global health challenges.},

Abstract = {Lecture capture is used increasingly in the UK, and has become a normal
   feature of higher education. Most studies on the impact of lecture
   capture have focused on benefits to student learning, the flipped
   classroom or student non-attendance at lectures following its
   introduction. It is less clear how the use of lecture capture has
   impacted on lecturers' own academic practice. In this study, we use a
   mixed-methodsapproach to explore the impact of this intrusive yet
   invisible technology on the quality of teaching. We have mapped our
   findings to the UK Professional Standards Framework (UKPSF). In doing
   so, our data paints a mixed picture of lecture capture's Janus-faced
   reality. On the one hand, it enhances lecturer self-awareness, planning
   and conscious performance'; on the other hand, it crushes spontaneity,
   impairs interaction and breeds wariness through constant surveillance.
   While the Teaching Excellence Framework rewards institutions for
   providing state-of-the-art technology and lecture recording systems, our
   findings pose awkward questions as to whether lecture capture is making
   teaching more bland and instrumental, albeit neatly aligned to
   dimensions of the UKPSF. We provide contradictory evidence about lecture
   capture technology, embraced by students, yet tentatively adopted by
   most academics. The implications of our study are not straightforward,
   except to proceed with caution, valuing the benefits but ensuring that
   learning is not dehumanised through blind acceptance at the moment we
   press the record button.},

Abstract = {This work describes the design and validation process of a questionnaire
   that gauges and analyses the degree of preference and usefulness of
   developing innovative alternative proposals expressed by university
   students taking courses through Project and Research Work (PTI); a
   dynamic based on the active and cooperative flipped classroom; a
   formative evaluation that takes into account both the process and the
   result using rubrics that assign valuation on different levels of
   achievement; diversity and plural materials or the progressive
   monitoring of the productions through learning folders, among others.
   Through a methodological design of the survey type (descriptive and
   transversal), the instrument is articulated around 46 items grouped into
   five dual response categories-student preference and teacher
   preference-analysed following application with 640 university students.
   The outcomes obtained offer satisfactory psychometric qualities of the
   instrument that allow us to consider its use to measure the preference
   and usefulness of factors associated with the processes of change
   through innovations in university education, also, the dates indicate
   consistency at the two preference levels and the response trend is
   defined. The conclusions provide reliable references on the proposal of
   teaching innovation and show the effectiveness and usefulness for
   learning that students assign to different aspects developed during the
   project regarding: strategies used, material or resources, type of
   support, evaluation and performance. The data serve to correct certain
   educational proposals and improve models to continue advancing in
   alternative approaches. This research helps to understand and transform
   transformative practices in the university.},

Title = {Medical students' experiences of health inequalities and inclusion

Journal = {CLINICAL TEACHER},

Abstract = {Background: Inclusion health groups experience a significantly larger
   burden of morbidity and mortality than the general public. Despite this,
   undergraduate medical education is often limited in its approach to
   inclusion health curricula, leaving students disengaged and lacking
   understanding.
   Methods: We conducted two research studies to explore medical students'
   experiences of inclusion health education. All participants were
   studying medicine at the University of Leeds at the time of data
   collection. We gathered experiences of both compulsory and elective
   inclusion health education via semi-structured interviews. Interview
   responses were audio-recorded, transcribed and analysed thematically.
   Findings: We identified several key findings across the two studies.
   Firstly, medical students felt unprepared to work with inclusion health
   groups.
   Further to this, medical students have a preference for interactive
   teaching and learning in inclusion health education.
   Finally, encountering inclusion health groups by chance (on placement)
   or choice (optional initiatives) present different opportunities.
   Discussion and Conclusion: Our research suggests that simply being
   exposed to inclusion health groups through lectures and on placement is
   not considered sufficient by medical students, and in fact can lead to
   the perpetuation of misinformation and stigma.
   Participants perceived that optional initiatives or `choice encounters'
   had profoundly positive impacts on attitudes and interest, particularly
   when there were opportunities to learn directly from individuals with
   lived experience of exclusion. We suggest that a flipped classroom
   approach to inclusion health education along with integrated
   experiential learning would provide medical students with comprehensive
   and patient-focused learning opportunities.},

Title = {Gamifying anatomy education},
Journal = {CLINICAL ANATOMY},
Year = {2018},
Volume = {31},
Number = {7},
Pages = {997-1005},
Month = {OCT},
Abstract = {The objective of our research is to find out if gamification increases
   motivation for self-directed learning (SDL) of human anatomy among year
   1 medical students, and more importantly, their academic grades (n =
   120). At the NUS Yong Loo Lin School of Medicine, anatomy teaching has
   traditionally been delivered via didactic means. To encourage more
   active learning, suitable games (non-digital) and the script concordance
   test were utilized to enhance the process. The flipped classroom
   approach was also introduced to further trigger active learning. In
   addition, the use of mobile apps (digital) was also initiated as
   supplements for SDL. Feedback was collected based on the previously
   validated PRO-SDL scale. Results from the research yielded inconclusive
   evidence to support enhanced motivation among our students due to
   gamification (P > 0.05). However, it did help to encourage active
   participation for a ``fun learning{''} experience supported by numerous
   positive comments. More importantly, the participant's continuous
   assessment (CA1, CA2, and CA3) and objective specific practical exam
   results were better than the cohort's average (P < 0.05), suggesting
   that enhanced meta-cognition, and factual recall had taken place. While
   it is positive, there are some caveats to note with gamification, first
   and foremost, that it is tutor dependent. Taken together, gamification
   could represent a new paradigm for anatomy education, and also an
   opportune time to change the prevailing culture in the healthcare and
   education industry. Clin. Anat. 31:997-1005, 2018. (c) 2018 Wiley

Title = {Immunology Education Without Borders},
Journal = {FRONTIERS IN IMMUNOLOGY},
Year = {2019},
Volume = {10},
Month = {AUG 28},
Abstract = {One of the mandates of the International Union of Immunological
   Societies (IUIS) is to promote immunological education to young
   scientists across the globe, including a large focus on those from low
   and low-to-middle income countries (LIC and LMIC). It strives to achieve
   this goal through the Education Committee (EDU), which is one of ten
   committees of the IUIS. To this end, EDU organizes three to four
   one-week courses per year in close cooperation with regional
   immunological societies and local organizers. Initially, the focus has
   been on Africa, addressing the most relevant topics and health issues
   facing specific countries or regions in the continent. The idea was then
   extended to Latin America and now also includes courses in Asia. The
   faculty of all courses is a blend of international and local/regional
   experts also known for their teaching expertise. The courses are highly
   interactive, and include ``meet-the-speakers{''} sessions, poster walks,
   and sessions on grant or PhD project writing, and on practical aspects
   of becoming a successful scientist. Importantly, all the IUIS-EDU
   courses use a combination of pre- and during-course on-line learning
   followed by consolidation of knowledge in a collegial setting. This
   ``flipped{''} classroom approach ensures that participants have acquired
   the basic knowledge needed to optimize their participation in the
   course. Immunopaedia is the IUIS-endorsed immunology learning site used
   for this purpose. All faculty members are requested to contribute
   material related to their specific topic while students must learn the
   on-line material before coming in person to the course. All course
   participants have free access to all Immunopaedia material indefinitely.
   The implementation of regional immunology courses targeted to local
   health issues in areas of the world where PhD students, post-doctoral,
   and early career scientists often do not have access to open on-line
   resources and contact with renowned experts in the field has proven to
   be highly successful. The long-term impact of this structured
   educational program is already visible through the large number of young
   scientists who are now connected via Immunopaedia and who are forming
   networks in regions where there had been very little contact before and
   building new Immunological Societies.},

Title = {Do Flipped Learning and Adaptive Instruction Improve Student Learning
   Outcome? A Case Study of a Computer Programming Course in Taiwan},
Journal = {FRONTIERS IN PSYCHOLOGY},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {12},
Month = {JAN 14},
Abstract = {Flipped learning could improve the learning effectiveness of students.
   However, some studies have pointed out the limitations related to
   flipped classrooms because the content of the flipped course does not
   vary according to the needs of the students. On the other hand, adaptive
   teaching, which customizes the learning mode according to the individual
   needs of students, can make up for some of the shortcomings of flipped
   teaching. This study combines adaptive teaching with flipped teaching
   and applies it to face-to-face classroom activities. The purpose of this
   research is to explore whether the implementation of flipping and
   adaptive learning in a computer programming course can improve the
   learning effectiveness of students. The experimental subjects of this
   study are the sophomore students in the Department of Information
   Management. The flipped classroom with adaptive instruction has been
   realized in the limited course time. This study uses questionnaires to
   collect pre- and post-test data on the ``learning motivation{''} of
   students. The learning effectiveness was evaluated based on the
   students' previous programming course (C language) and the semester
   scores of this course. Research results show that the post-test
   ``learning motivation{''} has improved overall compared with the
   pre-test, and the learning effect is significant. The results of this
   research not only prove the effectiveness of modern teaching theories in
   programming courses but also lay the foundation for future teaching
   design.},

Abstract = {Objective. To identify the specific study behaviors that promoted
   student pharmacists' success in an active-learning pharmacy curriculum.
   Methods. The Washington State University College of Pharmacy and
   Pharmaceutical Sciences implemented an active-learning, flipped
   classroom model for instruction to equitably deliver course content to
   Doctor of Pharmacy students on both its main and extended campuses.
   Students' ability to adapt to the new model and its impact on their
   study behaviors were unknown. A qualitative descriptive design that
   included semi-structured interviews was applied to evaluate the study
   behaviors of high-performing students. The study sample included 13
   third and fourth professional year pharmacy students in the top 20\% of
   their respective classes.
   Results. Interview responses were unaffected by baseline demographics
   such as gender and year of graduation. Content analysis generated five
   primary themes related to the behavioral strategies used by high
   performers: preparing for class, preparing for testing, seeking help,
   knowing yourself, and building on strengths. These were mapped to the
   four tenants of Wenger's social learning theory in the representation of
   findings: learning as doing, learning as belonging, learning as
   becoming, and learning as experience.
   Conclusion. High-performing students demonstrated a refined ability to
   select and modify study behaviors that aided in their academic success,
   demonstrating a high degree of metacognition. The results of this
   research may assist pharmacy faculty members in identifying critical
   elements for success of students enrolled in pharmacy programs using an
   active learning model.},

Title = {The use of simulators for teaching fine needle puncture in veterinary

Abstract = {Fine needle puncture (FNP) is widely used by veterinarians and is mostly
   taught by observation. Currently, the use of simulators is considered to
   improve the learning of practical procedures. However, FNP simulators
   have not yet been evaluated in veterinary medicine. Fifty-one veterinary
   students with no previous experience in cytology were randomly assigned
   to two groups that used a simulator (box with artificial nodules) and a
   piece of fruit (banana). A flipped classroom design with stations was
   used: first, students watched a tutorial video on FNP, then used the
   simulator or fruit piece for up to 15 minutes. Then, students performed
   the procedure on a realistic animal model, and a objective structured
   clinical examination (OSCE) was performed. Learning through the models
   was compared using quizzes, OSCE pass rate, and quality of the smears
   obtained. After watching the video tutorial, no students expressed being
   able to perform the FNP on a live animal. Conversely, most revealed that
   they were capable after the simulation. Students practiced longer on the
   box (14.8 +/- 0.8 min) than on the piece of fruit (8.5 +/- 2.2 min). On
   evaluation, the former had greater accuracy on the FNP. Still, there
   were no differences in the pass rate in OSCE. Therefore, both models are
   effective for learning the FNP, but the box has advantages regarding
   autonomous practice repetition. This repetition seems to have positive
   effects on FNP accuracy, which has relevance from a clinical point of
   view.},

Title = {Residency Exposure to Emergency Medical Services Concepts Through

Abstract = {Introduction: The use of innovative strategies for teaching, such as
   flipped classroom and assembly line education, has become increasingly
   popular to engage learners. Residency education has been incorporating
   these methods to master content, develop critical skills, and improve
   professionalism.
   Methods: We created a three-part immersion experience to teach Emergency
   Medical Services (EMS) concepts to emergency medicine residents.
   Residents participated in a mass casualty incident (MCI) in which they
   were tasked to triage patients and allocate resources in a hospital to
   treat 11 victims properly. The second portion was to manage a cardiac
   arrest scenario in the field with the tools our EMS colleagues had
   available. Lastly, they were asked to create short, high-yield lectures
   about topics related to EMS.
   Results: Pre- and post-test surveys were used to assess the
   effectiveness of the experience in teaching residents core EMS topics.
   It was determined that residents not only felt more prepared for an MCI,
   but they also were more comfortable with their skills as a result of
   participating in this activity.
   Conclusion: Our study further highlights the benefits of non-traditional
   techniques in residency education. The use of immersion experiences was
   unique and overall a positive experience for learners. The techniques
   used in this activity allowed residents to gain confidence in more
   challenging topics for emergency physicians. This format could be
   applied to many more topics in the future as an innovative education
   technique.},

Abstract = {This paper considers the problem of blended learning as a means of
   foreign students' integration into higher school environment. This
   process is not that simple, it demands special methods to help foreign
   students to be integrated easily. The use of blended learning in
   education facilitates easy students' integration and leads to positive
   learning results. However, the application of blended learning is
   connected with challenges both educators and foreign students can face.
   The aim of the article is to consider and assess the use of blended
   learning at the lessons of English implemented into a university
   educational process. For that purpose, we applied such methods as a
   needs analysis (among lecturers of English from South Ural State
   University), a questionnaire and an interview (among three groups of
   students from similar bachelor's programs). The findings show that the
   majority of those surveyed do understand the importance of blended
   learning as a means of foreign students' integration, but they are not
   familiar with the types and how to use them. Based on the results of
   this analysis, the authors applied blended learning into the process of
   English teaching, such as flipped classroom, station rotation, and a new
   online language development course, ``Methodological support to the
   textbook by McCarthy, M. ``Touchstone{''}. The drawn conclusions
   indicate that blended learning allows not only to boost foreign language
   skills, but to promote easy foreign students' integration into the
   educational process of the university.},

Title = {Development and assessment of an online virtual orthodontic curriculum},
Journal = {JOURNAL OF DENTAL EDUCATION},
Abstract = {Introduction Due to break space and time limits, an entirely new online
   curriculum of orthodontic education with online evaluation system has
   been structured and developed in the dental school, based on virtual
   reality simulation. Curriculum At Nanjing Medical University, a new
   online orthodontic curriculum with programmatic assessment process was
   constructed and implemented based on competency-based education (CBE).
   It was consisted of the online orthodontic theoretical lectures based on
   the National Open Online Course ``Orthodontics,{''} the online journal
   club via the online ``flipped classroom,{''} and the online orthodontic
   pre-clinical training via the virtual learning network platform. In
   order to evaluate this curriculum, 94 Year 4 dental students took part
   to complete the online orthodontic curriculum. The mean total score of
   all the students was 91.99, and the element scores of the online
   theoretical lectures, journal club, virtual pre-clinical training, and
   online final examination were respectively 96.83, 79.49, 96.00, and
   87.02, which showed a good performance. According to the student
   feedback toward this curriculum via the online questionnaire, nearly
   98\% of the students showed agreement or strong agreement that the
   online orthodontic curriculum has enhanced their orthodontic theoretical
   understanding and orthodontic practical ability. Conclusion As a
   student-centered CBE, this online orthodontic curriculum with online
   evaluation system could provide both orthodontic theory and practice
   teaching for all the dental students at all times and places based on
   the online virtual mode, which enriched learners' critical thinking,
   problem solving, and assessment skills.},

Abstract = {Background Tracheostomy management is considered an area of advanced
   practice for speech-language therapists (SLTs) internationally.
   Infrequent exposure and limited access to specialist SLTs are barriers
   to competency development. Aims To evaluate the benefits of postgraduate
   tracheostomy education programme for SLTs working with children and
   adults. Methods \& Procedures A total of 35 SLTs participated in the
   programme, which included a 1-day tracheostomy simulation-based
   workshop. Before the workshop, SLTs took an online knowledge quiz and
   then completed a theory package. The workshop consisted of part-task
   skill learning and simulated scenarios. Scenarios were video recorded
   for delayed independent appraisal of participant performance. Manual
   skills were judged as (1) completed successfully, (2) completed
   inadequately/needed assistance or (3) lost opportunity. Core non-medical
   skills required when managing a crisis situation and overall performance
   were scored using an adapted Ottawa Global Rating Scale (GRS). Feedback
   from participants was collected and self-perceived confidence rated
   prior, immediately post and 4 months post-workshop. Outcomes \& Results
   SLTs successfully performed 94\% of manual tasks. Most SLTs (29 of 35)
   scored > 5 of 7 on all elements of the adapted Ottawa GRS. Workshop
   feedback was positive with significant increases in confidence ratings
   post-workshop and maintained at 4 months. Conclusions \& Implications
   Postgraduate tracheostomy education, using a flipped-classroom approach
   and low- and high-fidelity simulation, is an effective way to increase
   knowledge, confidence and manual skill performance in SLTs across
   patient populations. Simulation is a well-received method of learning.},

Abstract = {The key idea of humanizing chemistry education is the integration of the
   values of humanity and society with the fundamental content of chemical
   science and its practical application. The humanizing of chemistry and
   pedagogy education in institutions of higher education is viewed through
   the humanizing of the content of chemistry education and the use of
   modern humanities-based teaching technologies. In the research, the
   humanizing of the content of chemistry education was provided by the
   introduction of historical and national elements, namely, information
   about the Kazakh chemists and their contribution to world science. For
   the formation, via chemistry education, of the basic educational values
   stipulated by the State Compulsory Standard of Higher Education of the
   Republic of Kazakhstan (Kazakh patriotism and civic responsibilities,
   respect, cooperation, openness), modern educational technologies such as
   project-based learning, game-based learning, interactive learning and
   flipped classroom (a model of blended learning) were used. Students of
   three universities attended the experiment. The control and experimental
   groups consisting of these students were established. To analyze the
   formation of basic values via chemistry education a questionnaire method
   and specially developed assessment criteria were used.
   The pedagogical experiment showed the effectiveness of the educational
   technologies used for the formation of Kazakh patriotism, respect,
   cooperation, and openness. The specifics of the application of modern
   humanities-based teaching technologies to chemistry education of
   students obtaining a bachelor's degree in pedagogy were revealed. These
   specifics conflict with the traditional approach to education.},

Abstract = {This study presents findings from three different disciplines in STEMM
   (Science, Technology, Engineering, Mathematics and Medicine) and across
   different models of student-focused teaching. Specifically, we assessed
   the feasibility and effectiveness of flipped classroom approaches
   combined with team based learning (TBL), and TBL alone within STEMM,
   particularly in the disciplines of Physics, Engineering and Medicine
   across different year levels. TBL activities were incorporated into
   undergraduate Physics and Engineering cohorts, with students from a
   diverse range of majors and backgrounds and a graduate level Doctor of
   Medicine (MD) cohort. Quiz scores from the Physics cohort were
   significantly improved following TBL, exam scores from the engineering
   cohort were more evenly distributed than pre-TBL quiz scores and
   students in the medical cohort had higher quiz scores when working
   within teams rather than alone. Qualitative survey responses from both
   the physics and engineering cohorts indicated that students felt TBL was
   positive and increased their understanding of key concepts. Informal
   feedback from medical students following TBL classes was also very
   positive and students demonstrated obvious engagement. Comparisons for
   pre- versus post-TBL quiz scores for Physics, for pre-TBL quartile
   versus exam scores in Engineering and for Team versus Individual
   learning quiz scores in Medicine all provide evidence of effective
   student engagement and performance. The observation study suggests that
   TBL is a feasible and effective method of student-focused learning
   within STEMM. More rigorously designed studies are now required to
   further explore these findings.},

Title = {How Do Secondary Science Teachers Perceive the Use of Interactive
   Simulations? The Affordance in Singapore Context},

Abstract = {Research has shown that teaching science with a modeling-oriented
   approach, particularly with interactive simulations, will promote
   student engagement and understanding. To date, many interactive
   simulations have been developed and adopted for classroom practices. The
   purpose of this study was to explore secondary school science teachers'
   perceived affordance of interactive simulation as well as their
   practical experience with simulation implementation in class. Twelve
   science teachers from seven schools were interviewed individually and
   the data was triangulated with their teaching plans and student
   assignments. Their past experiences of simulation implementation
   revealed that most teachers adopted simulations for demonstration
   purpose in teacher-led instruction. Their attempts to provide students
   opportunities to use the simulations to explore alternative modeling by
   themselves did not seem to work well. There are various reasons for
   this, such as the shortage of facilities, Internet bandwidth, and
   technological knowledge. There was also a pressing need for teachers to
   complete the required syllabus in limited classroom time. The majority
   of teachers' future intent to use simulation in class was quite weak,
   especially with the less proficient students who had some difficulty
   understanding simulations. Although interactive simulations have great
   potential to promote students' understanding in abstract science
   concepts, overcoming the difficulties of implementation may require
   other alternatives such as a flipped classroom approach. Future studies
   can investigate how to design learning activities outside class, to
   engage students in exploring modeling in simulations.},

Title = {Show me and I'll remember: association between instructional modality
   and memory for learning},
Journal = {JOURNAL OF INTERNATIONAL EDUCATION IN BUSINESS},
Year = {2019},
Volume = {12},
Number = {1},
Pages = {95-110},
Abstract = {Purpose The purpose of this paper is to explore the association between
   memory (short- and long-term), a foundational cognition in learning and
   face-to-face, video-based and flipped instructional modalities.
   Design/methodology/approach This study used a one-way analysis of
   variance and linear regression analyses to compare students' aggregated
   answers on multiple-choice questions over two different periods,
   including a repeat question from an earlier examination. Also,
   student-level answers were subjected to a binary logistic regression.
   Findings Face-to-face unambiguously was associated with superior
   short-term memory including ethics. Video-based performance was
   associated with a superior long-term memory, and flipped's performance
   lay in between for both memory types.
   Research limitations/implications This study does not account for
   students' learning styles, instructors' preferred teaching approach and
   computer-aided virtual simulations.
   Practical implications The findings of this study may serve as a
   reference point for optimally blending multiple instruction modalities
   to leverage its association with memory for learning matched to
   instructors' styles, students' curricular pathway and coping with
   institutional imperatives.
   Social implications This paper provides a way for higher education
   institutions to match instructional modalities to memory needs,
   including business ethics as students' progress on their pathways
   towards graduation.
   Originality/value This study illuminates the association between memory,
   a widely accepted foundational cognition in learning that has been under
   researched compared to critical thinking and reasoning, and three
   instructional modalities: face-to-face, video-based and flipped
   classroom.},

Abstract = {Practical demonstration of cardiomyocyte function requires substantial
   preparation, a source of freshly isolated animal hearts, and specialized
   equipment. Even where such resources are available, it is not conducive
   for demonstration to any more than a few students at a time. These
   approaches are also not consistent with the 3R principle (replacement,
   reduction, and refinement) of ethical use of animals. We present an
   implementation of the LabHEART software, developed by Donald Bers and
   Jose Puglisi, for medical students. Prior to the activity, students had
   lectures covering the physiological and pharmacological aspects of
   cardiac excitation-contraction (EC) coupling. We used this problem-based
   activity to help students consolidate their knowledge and to allow a
   hands-on approach to explore the key features of EC coupling. Students
   simulate and measure action potentials, intracellular calcium changes,
   and cardiomyocyte contraction. They also apply drugs that target ion
   channels (e.g., nifedipine or tetrodotoxin) or sympathetic input (using
   isoproterenol) and explore changes to EC coupling. Furthermore, by
   modifying the biophysical parameters of key ion channels involved in the
   electrical activity of the heart, students also explore the effect of
   channelopathies such as long QT syndromes. We describe approaches to
   implement this activity in a flipped classroom format, with recorded
   lecture materials provided ahead of the practical to facilitate active
   learning. We also describe our experiences implementing this activity
   online. The content and difficulty of the activity can be altered to
   suit individual courses and is also amenable to promote peer-driven
   learning.},

Title = {A virtual emergency: learning lessons from remote medical student
   education during the COVID-19 pandemic},
Journal = {EMERGENCY RADIOLOGY},
Year = {2021},
Volume = {28},
Number = {3},
Pages = {445-452},
Month = {JUN},
Abstract = {Purpose The COVID-19 pandemic resulted in the cancelation of traditional
   on-site clinical rotations for medical students across the country.
   Radiology educators have had to rapidly adapt to a new, virtual
   educational landscape. We describe our experience restructuring a Trauma
   and Emergency Radiology Elective to an online format and present survey
   data obtained from students who completed the course.
   Methods This elective is a 4-week course offered to third and fourth
   year medical students at a large Level 1 Trauma Center. Changes to the
   traditional rotation included assigning an increased number of
   self-study educational resources, independent review of unknown cases
   using a virtual workstation, and online interactive conferences. At the
   conclusion of each block, students were asked to complete post-course
   feedback surveys.
   Results Thirteen students enrolled in this online course; 92\% submitted
   post-course surveys. Students strongly agreed that the course was
   clinically relevant, with accessible, engaging material (average score,
   4.92/5), and 91.7\% of students were very likely to recommend this
   rotation to others. Students reported improved post-course confidence in
   ordering and interpreting imaging studies. A majority (60\%) of students
   who had previously taken an on-site course would have preferred a course
   that combined traditional and online learning elements.
   Conclusions The success of our online rotation highlights the merits of
   self-directed learning and flipped-classroom techniques. Many of the
   principles incorporated into this course could be applied and/or
   modified to increase medical student engagement when students return to
   the hospital.},

Abstract = {Learner-centered pedagogical methods that are based on clinical
   application of basic science concepts through active learning and
   problem solving are shown to be effective for improving knowledge
   retention. As the clinical relevance of biochemistry is not always
   apparent to health-profession students, effective teaching of medical
   biochemistry should highlight the implications of biochemical concepts
   in pathology, minimize memorization, and make the concepts memorable for
   long-term retention. Here, we report the creation and successful
   implementation of a flipped jigsaw activity that was developed to
   stimulate interest in learning biochemistry among medical students. The
   activity combined the elements of a flipped classroom for learning
   concepts followed by a jigsaw activity to retrieve these concepts by
   solving clinical cases, answering case-based questions, and creating
   concept maps. The students' reception of the activity was very positive.
   They commented that the activity provided them an opportunity to review
   and synthesize information, helped to gage their learning by applying
   this information and work with peers. Students' improved performance
   especially for answering the comprehension-based questions correctly in
   the postquiz as well as the depth of information included in the
   postquiz concept maps suggested that the activity helped them to
   understand how different clinical scenarios develop owing to deviations
   in basic biochemical pathways. Although this activity was created for
   medical students, the format of this activity can also be useful for
   other health-professional students as well as undergraduate and graduate
   students. (c) 2018 by The International Union of Biochemistry and

Abstract = {The aim of the current study is to explore and evaluate the current
   status of massive open online courses (MOOCs) in the field of
   Engineering Education. In line with this aim, the study intends to
   identify and map the role of ``MOOCs in engineering education
   research{''} through a review of empirical articles published in
   peer-reviewed journals indexed in the ``Web of Science,{''} ``IEEE
   Xplore,{''} ``Scopus,{''} ``Science Direct,{''} and the ``ACM Digital
   Library{''} databases. Social network analysis, content analysis, and
   inferential-descriptive statistics were applied in the study. The
   study's findings indicate a growing trend in ``MOOCs in engineering
   education research.{''} Online virtual labs, social networks, flipped
   classroom strategy, active learning, small private online courses, and
   motivation are the key lodestar topics in ``MOOCs in engineering
   education research{''} and engineering education researchers mostly
   employ practice-based and quantitative research approaches. Besides
   this, it was found that engineering education researchers use MOOCs for
   three main purposes: designing a domain-specific MOOC with unique
   features; developing a system/model for e-learning and MOOCs, or aiming
   to improve engineering education using interactive online technologies.
   The findings of the current study indicate that engineering education
   researchers primarily give importance to performance outcomes and
   motivation in learning, and try to increase the quality of engineering
   education through the use of MOOCs. Finally, the findings imply that the
   general discourse among the sampled articles is positive, and may be
   considered useful in the exploration of potential research into ``MOOCs
   in engineering education research.{''}},

Abstract = {English is the important international language in the world. In Asia,
   many non-English-speaking countries regard English writing education as
   one of the primary goals of English education reform. Faced with this
   trend, teachers tried to train students to master the skills of English
   writing to cope with the global villages in the twenty first century. In
   the flipped classroom, although students could effectively receive
   out-of-class and in-class opportunities for exercises to improve
   learning; however, summarizing, organizing, even evaluating others'
   writing remain difficult tasks for students. In order to develop
   students' learner autonomy or high-level thinking skills to achieve the
   goal of English teaching, the use of mind-mapping learning strategy is
   known an effective knowledge construction tool for helping students'
   organizational thinking and paraphrasing in English writing skills.
   Besides, many previous studies have considered the peer assessment an
   effective learning strategy in the writing classrooms to provide
   students with a teacher's perspective view to think and evaluate
   writing. Therefore, this research developed an online peer assessment
   approach to supporting mind-mapping flipped classrooms. Moreover, an
   experiment has been conducted to evaluate the advantages and
   disadvantages of the proposed approach on students' English learning
   analytics such as time involvement and learning reflections. It is
   important that educators could continuously create the online peer
   assessment learning environment for learners and aim for the goals to
   help learners become more critical, independent, and autonomous in
   English language learning.},

Abstract = {Background: With an aging population and increasing demand on health
   care systems, biomedical engineering as an undergraduate program fits a
   growing societal need. As such, many Canadian universities have
   implemented biomedical engineering undergraduate programs. This provides
   a unique opportunity for core engineering faculty, engineering education
   researchers, and curriculum specialists to implement proven educational
   theories in the core curriculum of these programs to ensure exemplary
   and competent Canadian-trained biomedical engineering graduates.
   Purpose: This paper discusses the need for biomedical engineering as a
   core undergraduate program in Canada, the historical context of
   educational theories as related to biomedical undergraduate engineering
   education, a framework for the implementation of proven strategies, and
   learner-centric methods that benefit the learner, mentor, and society as
   a whole.
   Scope/method: The historical context of curriculum theories related to
   biomedical engineering undergraduate education, evaluation of the
   intrinsic and extrinsic curriculum theories in current biomedical
   engineering undergraduate education, educating progressive learners and
   development of future biomedical engineering undergraduate education
   curriculum, is explored.
   Conclusion: The integration of educational theories in the development
   of a biomedical engineering undergraduate engineering education is
   essential to ensure learners are provided with opportunities to
   experience cutting edge, quality engineering education. Empirical
   evidence demonstrates the successful implementation of applied
   methodologies such as model-electing activities, problem-based learning,
   and the flipped classroom. Providing biomedical engineering faculty with
   professional development opportunities around the successfully
   implementation of these tools aimed at culturally diverse, globalized
   21st-century learners, can be catalytic in shifting to a new paradigm
   for engineering education in Canada and globally.},

Abstract = {The changing pattern of gaining knowledge and learning skills in
   response to the evolution of the nursing curriculum and generational
   cohort.s gap is a great challenge for the nurse educators in today.s
   generation. This paper has the goal to review the classroom pedagogical
   approaches in nursing education and analyze how efficient a certain
   pedagogy to the teaching-learning process of the student nurses.
   Nevertheless, it is generally accepted that the different pedagogy may
   depend on the nature of the learners, therefore, it is favorably
   considered relative. The systematic review involves the elements of
   population, the nursing students, innovative classroom learning pedagogy
   as intervention/s, reviewed in comparison to the traditional learning
   pedagogy and outcome/s desired is the active learning engagement and
   improved learning competencies of the student nurses. From three hundred
   twenty-one research articles identified through academic database
   searching, ten studies were included as it fulfilled the inclusion
   criteria after rigorous screening for eligibility and appraisal. The
   reviewed innovative pedagogies such as flipped classroom, collaborative
   classroom stimulation, self-directed learning, mastery modeling, used of
   apple technology, clicker technology, utilizing team-based learning, and
   application of expert patient illness narratives, have aimed for the
   engagement and enhancement of active learning and critical thinking of
   the learners. Underpinned by several studies, these pedagogies are
   significantly framed to dynamically explicit more interactive learnings.
   Predominantly, it provides the nurse educators a pedagogical repertoire
   in conceptualizing best to its finest pedagogy for student-centered
   nursing curriculum as perceived to be necessary and applicable to
   constantly connect with the learners. Copyright (C) 2019,},

Title = {A multilevel investigation of factors influencing university students'
   behavioral engagement in flipped classrooms},
Journal = {COMPUTERS \& EDUCATION},

Abstract = {Students' behavioral engagement is critical for flipped classroom
   success. Research on flipped and non-flipped classrooms has provided
   mixed findings regarding students' behavioral engagement. Using the
   motivation-opportunity-ability perspective and self-determination
   theory, in this study, we aim to empirically test how student-level
   motivation (i.e., autonomous and controlled), student-level ability
   (i.e., perceived self-efficacy), and class-level opportunity (i.e.,
   perceived teaching quality and perceived platform quality) influence
   students' behavioral engagement in flipped classrooms. Data were
   collected with a survey completed by 1002 students in 30 classes with
   flipped classrooms at public and private universities and tested using
   hierarchical linear modeling (HLM). The results revealed that autonomous
   motivation, controlled motivation, perceived self-efficacy, and
   perceived teaching quality were critical determinants of university
   students' behavioral engagement in flipped classrooms. When perceived
   self-efficacy was high, the positive relationship between autonomous
   motivation and behavioral engagement became stronger. Moreover, when
   perceived platform quality was high, the positive relationship between
   autonomous motivation and behavioral engagement became stronger. In
   addition, when perceived platform quality was low, the negative
   relationship between controlled motivation and behavioral engagement
   became stronger. Follow-up interviews with the students emphasized five
   contradictions in flipped classrooms that hindered behavioral
   engagement-there was tension between types of learning, the videos were
   boring, not all students actually participated in the discussions,
   students lacked sufficient time for in-class activities, and teachers
   did not have good interaction skills. Implications of flipped classrooms
   are also discussed.},

Abstract = {The paper shows the experience of BYOD-technology integration in
   teaching English at National Research Tomsk Polytechnic University
   (TPU). To find solutions to the problem, we studied the road maps of the
   leading universities in Russia, the unconditional goal of each is to
   enter the rating of 5-100 world universities. According to the analysis
   of language training current state, only 20-28\% of students have B1
   level, which indicates readiness for the certification exam. Training
   intensification requires the integration of innovative methods and
   approaches, such as the ``flipped classroom technology{''} method,
   m-learning, the Internet of Things, adaptive learning technologies,
   increasing and updating open educational resources, online textbooks and
   English learning platforms. The key direction of BYOD-technology is the
   presence of devices; we analyzed the use of social networks and mobile
   messengers among TPU students. An integrated approach through the
   improvement of BYOD-technology is used to eliminate the causes of
   English language insufficient knowledge. The intensification model of
   foreign language teaching process using BYOD-technology is
   substantiated. The rationale for the model use is the method of
   increasing student possessions by solving important pedagogical tasks,
   allowing the full range of interactive repositories to be used for the
   learning process. The key direction of the BYOD-technology is the
   presence of devices; the use of social networks and mobile messengers
   among TPU students was analyzed. The expedience of BYOD-technology
   integrating in the educational process for training foreign language
   intensification was defined. Training intensity when using this
   technology was empirically proven.},

Title = {Dissecting the Contemporary Clerkship: Theory-based Educational Trial of
   Videos Versus Lectures in Medical Student Education},
Journal = {AEM EDUCATION AND TRAINING},
Year = {2020},
Volume = {4},
Number = {1},
Pages = {10-17},
Month = {JAN},
Abstract = {BackgroundDespite increasing use of the flipped classroom (FC) technique
   in undergraduate medical education, the benefit in learning outcomes
   over lectures is inconsistent. Best practices in preclass video design
   principles are rarely used, and it is unclear if videos can replace
   lectures in contemporary medical education.
   MethodsWe conducted a prospective quasi-experimental controlled
   educational study comparing theory-based videos to traditional lectures
   in a medical student curriculum. Medical students enrolled in an
   emergency medicine clerkship were randomly assigned to either a lecture
   group (LG) or a video group (VG). The slide content was identical, and
   the videos aligned with cognitive load theory-based multimedia design
   principles. Students underwent baseline (pretest), week 1 (posttest),
   and end-of-rotation (retention) written knowledge tests and an observed
   structured clinical examination (OSCE) assessment. We compared scores
   between both groups and surveyed student attitudes and satisfaction with
   respect to the two learning methods.
   ResultsThere were 104 students who participated in OSCE assessments (49
   LG, 55 VG) and 101 students who participated in knowledge tests (48 LG,
   53 VG). The difference in OSCE scores was statistically significant 1.29
   (95\% confidence interval = 0.23 to 2.35, t(102) = 2.43, p = 0.017), but
   the actual score difference was small from an educational standpoint
   (12.61 for LG, 11.32 for VG). All three knowledge test scores for both
   groups were not significantly different.
   ConclusionsVideos based on cognitive load theory produced similar
   results and could replace traditional lectures for medical students.
   Educators contemplating a FC approach should devote their valuable
   classroom time to active learning methods.},

Title = {Enhancement of student perceptions of learner-centeredness and community
   of inquiry in flipped classrooms},
Journal = {BMC MEDICAL EDUCATION},
Year = {2018},
Volume = {18},
Month = {OCT 23},
Abstract = {BackgroundFlipped classrooms (FC) are expected to create a more
   student-centered, active learning environment than traditional lectures.
   This study assessed the effectiveness of FC in promoting a
   student-centered, active learning environment by examining the changes
   in student perceptions of the learning environment of FC in terms of
   student-centeredness and sense of community of inquiry (COI), which
   represents the elements of a successful learning
   environment.MethodsQuestionnaires were given to a cohort of Year 2
   students in a six-year undergraduate medical education program, who had
   taken an introduction to medicine course in a FC format. The
   questionnaire included 7 items on the teaching orientation (i.e.,
   teacher-centered vs. student-centered) and 34 items from the Community
   of Inquiry Survey Instrument, which consisted of three sub-scales -
   teaching, social, and cognitive presences. The questionnaires were
   administered in pre- and post-test format during the first and last week
   of the semester.ResultsA total of 55 students returned the
   questionnaires (100\% response rate). The student perceptions of
   student-centeredness of FC increased significantly over time (p<0.001),
   and their perceptions of COI in FC also increased significantly in all
   three presences (p<0.001). The student perceptions of
   student-centeredness and sense of COI in FC increased significantly in
   both high-achieving and low-achieving students (p<0.01).ConclusionsThis
   study indicates that the flipped classroom model is an effective
   approach to fostering a learner-centered learning environment and
   developing a community of inquiry among medical students.},

Title = {Digital practical course of otorhinolaryngology and examination
   technique ``to go{''}},
Journal = {GMS JOURNAL FOR MEDICAL EDUCATION},
Year = {2020},
Volume = {37},
Number = {7},
Abstract = {Objective: The development of presentation-free teaching formats for
   practical exercises is a particular challenge. The objective of the
   presented project was the implementation of the practical course in
   otorhinolaryngology for learning examination techniques through digital
   distance learning.
   Methods: Disposable instruments for a comprehensive otorhinolaryngologic
   examination were purchased and made available to the students. The
   necessary light sources were everyday sports headlamps or flashlight
   constructions. The theoretical basics were taught using the learning
   platform CaseTrain, including photographic, audio and video material.
   Corresponding success controls in the sense of a digital short test were
   integrated here. In addition, video tutorials were used to present the
   examinations to be imitated in detail. In order to increase motivation,
   a creative photo competition was also announced, in which the practical
   tasks that were finally carried out independently were checked.
   Results: All students of the semester received a set of instruments for
   independent practical training. The entrance exam was passed by all
   students, and at least one photo was received from all students, many of
   which were particularly creative in the competition.
   Conclusion: The presented concept is a possibility to convert practical
   teaching formats into a digital presence-free concept. It included the
   teaching and testing of basic knowledge, instructions for practical
   exercises, the independent performance of subject-specific examination
   techniques and an increase in motivation and simultaneous control
   through gamification. We consider this teaching principle to be an
   attractive option for future ``Flipped Classroom{''} concepts with a
   gradual resumption of face-to-face teaching.},

Title = {Students-As-Teachers: Fostering medical educators},
Journal = {CLINICAL TEACHER},
Abstract = {Background: While mounting evidence supports various benefits of
   Students-As-Teachers (SAT) curricula in preparing students to teach,
   limited SAT electives are offered across Canada. We developed a 4-week
   SAT selective for fourth-year medical students at the University of
   Toronto to enhance medical education knowledge and teaching skills. This
   study aimed to evaluate the SAT programme and its impact on students'
   development as educators, their experience as learners and educators,
   and their future plans for involvement with medical education.
   Approach: Students participated in highly interactive small group
   seminars and teaching opportunities in nonclinical and clinical
   environments. Course evaluation consisted of pre-selective and
   post-selective surveys and written reflections on the selective
   experience and future career aspirations. A theory-based evaluation
   approach was utilized to compare the SAT programme's theory with course
   outcomes.
   Evaluation: Post-SAT selective, students self-reported greater knowledge
   and confidence in teaching methods, provision of feedback, medical
   education scholarship, and interest in further medical education
   training. Student reflections highlighted three key themes. Identity
   formation as educators and the importance of mentorship in medical
   education aligned with our programme theory, while an unexpected outcome
   included a shifting perception on teaching and feedback from a learner
   to an educator lens.
   Implications: This study's findings demonstrate the ability of SAT
   curricula to build capacity for future medical educators. Positive
   factors contributing to the programme's outcomes included cohort size,
   course and seminar structure, and active group participation. Future
   iterations may explore use of flipped classroom models, additional
   clinical teaching opportunities, and near-peer teaching.},

Title = {Student Response Systems: A Multidisciplinary Analysis Using Visual
   Analytics},
Journal = {EDUCATION SCIENCES},
Year = {2020},
Volume = {10},
Number = {12},
Month = {DEC},
Abstract = {In recent years, several innovations have emerged in the field of
   education, including Blended-Learning, Massive Open Online Courses,
   Flipped Classroom and Gamification. In particular, several
   investigations have highlighted the effectiveness of student response
   systems, or clickers, in different subjects and disciplines. Although
   some literature reviews have been published on this subject, none of
   them offer a review of a large volume of publications from a
   multidisciplinary approach. Similarly, in the literature there are no
   studies that have analyzed scientific collaborations on this subject. To
   respond to these concerns, we proposed the use of a bot to retrieve
   information from a large number of papers (1696 documents co-authored by
   a total of 4091 researchers) included in the Scopus database. The
   disciplines covered include natural sciences, engineering and
   technology, medical and health sciences, agricultural and veterinary
   sciences, social sciences and humanities, and the arts. The review of
   the literature reveals that student response systems are generally
   well-perceived by teachers and students in all the disciplines. Another
   interesting result achieved from visual data obtained using network
   visualization software and word clouds is that student response systems
   are mainly used in some disciplines, such as physics, chemistry,
   medicine, and nursing. It is clearly observed that the relationship
   between researchers from the same country is stronger than between
   researchers from different countries. Finally, some reflections are
   included on the role of student response systems in online teaching,
   especially regarding the changes experienced after the COVID-19
   pandemic.},

Year = {2020},

Abstract = {Introduction: Indian medical schools contribute significantly to the
   global pool of doctors. To strengthen the medical education system
   further, this study was aimed at identifying existing lacunae and
   proposing solutions, from perspective of medical undergraduates.
   Methodology: Medical undergraduates participated in group discussions
   under mentorship of an expert in medical education. Identification and
   prioritisation of problems was done based on demand and impact on
   medical education. After critically reviewing available literature,
   solutions were reached by consensus.
   Results: Six interested students participated in discussions.
   Classification of identified problems was done into domains of
   knowledge, skill training, and research. Major problems in `knowledge'
   were: inefficient utilisation of time of students and teachers, and
   unyielding assessments; in `skill training': inadequate training in
   skills; and in `research': insufficient awareness and interest in
   research among undergraduates. Some solutions suggested for respective
   domains were prioritisation of teaching and training of medical
   students, advocation of innovative methods of teaching and assessment
   like flipped classroom approach and clinical vignettes respectively;
   early initiation of undergraduate training in skill development
   following the principle of competency-based education; and sensitization
   of undergraduates towards research by introducing it as basic core and
   advanced elective subject, besides setting up research advisory cells
   and organising research conclaves.
   Conclusion: Problems were classified into domains of knowledge, skill
   training, and research. Proposed solutions involve a radical alteration
   in perception of students and teachers in terms of teaching-learning
   principles. There is a need to highlight these points before policy
   makers and implementers for a more robust medical education system.},

Title = {Developing interdisciplinary thinking in a food and nutritional

Journal = {JOURNAL OF AGRICULTURAL EDUCATION \& EXTENSION},
Year = {2020},
Volume = {26},
Number = {1, SI},
Pages = {113-127},
Month = {JAN 1},
Abstract = {Purpose: The purpose of this study was to describe faculty and graduate
   students' motivation and learning experiences in a multi-institutional,
   interdisciplinary graduate course focused on the nexus of food and
   nutritional security, hunger, and
   sustainability.Design/Methodology/Approach: A one-group pre-experimental
   case study design was used. Faculty and students completed
   questionnaires, which included rating scales and open-ended questions.
   Data were analyzed and triangulated into key findings.Findings: Results
   indicated that faculty were interested and engaged in the development of
   the interdisciplinary course, and students were engaged in
   interdisciplinary learning and developed communication and education
   skills through experiential place-based learning.Practical Implications:
   Faculty developed a common understanding of their different disciplinary
   perspectives that helped provide a more cohesive and complementary
   interdisciplinary learning experience for students. Students learned
   about global challenges while identifying similar challenges in their
   local communities through the experiential learning
   assignments.Theoretical Implications: The design of the
   interdisciplinary course helped students think critically and creatively
   to learn complex issues. Advances in technology and active learning
   support a flipped classroom model to engage students. Place-based
   learning combined with interdisciplinary classroom experiences connected
   students to local real-world contexts and provided students with
   practical applications of problem-solving, critical thinking, and
   systems thinking skills.Originality/Value: Graduate students conducted
   an asset and needs assessment, which connected them to professionals in
   the community. Students think food and nutritional security, hunger, and
   sustainability are global challenges and seldom notice food insecurity
   in their local communities.},

Title = {Training in Neurology: Neuro Day An Innovative Curriculum Connecting
   Medical Students With Patients},
Journal = {NEUROLOGY},
Year = {2021},
Volume = {96},
Number = {10},
Pages = {E1482-E1486},
Month = {MAR 9},
Abstract = {Objective
   To determine whether increased patient interaction, exposure to the
   neurologic examination, and access to positive neurology mentors
   increase interest in neurology for first-year medical students.
   Methods
   Neuro Day was a 2-part experience for first-year medical students. The
   first part consisted of a flipped classroom to teach the standard
   neurologic examination. The second part involved patient encounters
   modeled off of the traditional patient rounds. Students rotated from
   room to room, listening to patients' experiences with different
   neurologic diseases and eliciting pathologic neurologic examinations.
   Students were surveyed before and after Neuro Day.
   Results
   The result of the binomial test indicated that the proportion of medical
   students interested in neurology significantly increased from 78\% to
   85\% (95\% confidence interval {[}CI] 0.79-0.92; p = 0.034) after
   participating in Neuro Day. The proportion of students' knowledge of
   clinical neurology increased from 45\% to 63.1\% (95\% CI 0.54-0.72; p <
   0.0001), comfort with performing a neurologic examination increased
   from30\% to 78.4\% (95\% CI 0.70-0.86; p < 0.0001), and fear of studying
   neurology decreased from 46\% to 26\% (95\% CI 0.17-0.34; p < 0.0001)
   following Neuro Day. One hundred percent of students indicated that they
   would recommend Neuro Day to their peers.
   Conclusion
   Neuro Day is a feasible and effective model to incorporate into medical
   education. There was increased interest in and decreased fear of
   neurology. We anticipate that this paradigm can be used in the future to
   encourage students to consider a career in neurology.},

Title = {Online learning and COVID-19: a meta-synthesis analysis},
Journal = {CLINICS},
Year = {2020},
Volume = {75},
Abstract = {The COVID-19 pandemic demanded a quick shift from presential to
   e-learning processes. Unlike planned e-learning programs, medical
   schools have had to quickly deliver the entire medical curriculum using
   remote strategies. This study aimed to perform a meta-synthesis of
   previous pandemic situations and describe the experience of the Sao
   Paulo University School of Medicine.
   We searched the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials, Medline,
   EMBASE, Lilacs, Scopus, Web of Science, and ERIC, using the following
   keywords: ({''}SARS{''} OR ``severe acute respiratory syndrome{''} OR
   ``severe acute respiratory syndrome{''} OR ``Middle East Respiratory

   ``Education, Distance{''} OR ``e-learning{''} OR ``course online{''} OR
   ``flipped classroom{''}) AND ({''}lockdown{''} OR ``social distance{''}
   OR ``quarantine{''}). The endpoints were the online platforms used for
   online learning, the model of class, recorded versus online interaction,
   duration of online lectures, and students' and teachers' perceptions of
   online learning.
   We retrieved 38 records; only seven articles studied online education
   methods related to the pandemic and social distancing rules. The most
   frequently used online platform was Zoom (R). The studies examined both
   synchronous and asynchronous approaches. There was no evidence regarding
   duration and students' and teachers' attitude.
   This study suggests that the online learning shift was feasible;
   however, because of the nature of the education shift (pandemic), future
   studies must further analyze the educational structure.},

Title = {Incorporating sleep medicine content into medical school through

Journal = {NEUROLOGY},
Year = {2018},
Volume = {91},
Number = {13},
Pages = {597-610},
Month = {SEP 25},
Abstract = {Objective
   To present (1) justification for earmarking sleep medicine education as
   an essential component of all medical school curricula and (2) various
   avenues to incorporate sleep medicine exposure into medical school
   curricula through (primarily) neuroscience and neurology courses.
   Methods
   Per consensus of a team of leading neurology and sleep medicine
   educators, an evidence-based rationale for including sleep medicine
   across a 4-year medical school curriculum is presented along with
   suggested content, available/vetted resources, and formats for
   delivering sleep medicine education at various points and through
   various formats.
   Results
   Growing evidence has linked sleep disorders (e.g., sleep-disordered
   breathing, chronic insufficient sleep) as risk factors for several
   neurologic disorders. Medical educators in neurology/neuroscience are
   now strongly advocating for sleep medicine education in the context of
   neurology/neuroscience pre and post graduate medical education. Sleep
   medicine education is also a critical component of a proactive strategy
   to address physician wellness and burnout. The suggested curriculum
   proposes a sleep educational exposure time of 2-4 hours per year in the
   form of lectures, flipped-classroom sessions, clinical opportunities,
   and online educational tools that would result in a 200\%-400\% increase
   in the amount of sleep medicine exposure that US medical schools
   currently provide. The guidelines are accompanied by the recommendation
   for use of technological education, to facilitate more seamless
   curricular incorporation.
   Conclusion
   Even in this era with limited flexibility to add content to an already
   packed medical school curriculum, incorporating sleep medicine exposure
   into the current medical school curriculum is both justified and
   feasible.},

Title = {Medical Student Education Roadblock Due to COVID-19: Virtual Radiology
   Core Clerkship to the Rescue},
Journal = {ACADEMIC RADIOLOGY},
Year = {2020},
Volume = {27},
Number = {10},
Pages = {1461-1466},
Month = {OCT},
Abstract = {Rationale and Objectives: Medical schools were upended by the COVID-19
   pandemic, resulting in suspension of all in-person educational
   activities, and leaving clinical clerkships on hold indefinitely. A
   virtual curriculum and novel teaching methods were needed to fulfill
   curricular requirements. We developed a comprehensive virtual radiology
   clerkship and evaluated the efficacy of this novel method of teaching.
   Materials and Methods: A 4-week virtual radiology clerkship was designed
   to accommodate medical students who had not yet completed the required
   clerkship. The design included online flipped classroom modules, large
   group didactic lectures, and small group homeroom activities. Student
   performance was assessed via a standardized online final exam. Feedback
   from students was collected using online surveys. Student performance
   was compared to the in-person radiology clerkship.
   Results: One hundred and eleven medical students were enrolled in the
   virtual radiology clerkship. Final exam scores were similar to the
   in-person clerkship. Students indicated that small group homeroom
   activities had the highest overall satisfaction. Students recognized
   enthusiastic teachers regardless of class format. Exceptional course
   content and organization were also noted. Course weaknesses included
   didactic lecture content which was repetitive or too advanced, the
   limited opportunity to build personal connections with faculty, and
   scheduling conflicts with other competing school activities.
   Conclusion: A completely virtual radiology core clerkship can be a
   successful educational experience for medical students during a time
   when remote learning is required. A small group learning environment is
   most successful for student engagement. Personal connections between
   faculty and students can be challenging in a virtual course.},

Abstract = {Introduction Due to the Covid-19 social distancing restrictions, in
   March 2020, Weill Cornell Medicine-Qatar decided to replace students'
   clinical instruction with novel online electives. Hence, we implemented
   an innovative online and remote pathology curriculum, anchored on
   virtual microscopy and Zoom videoconferencing: ideal tools to support
   online teaching. Objective To assess a new curriculum implementation at
   Weill Cornell Medicine-Qatar. Materials and Methods This for-credit,
   2-week elective included 6 synchronous Zoom sessions where complex
   clinicopathological cases were discussed in small groups. We used open
   access digital microscopy slides from the University of Leeds' Virtual
   Pathology Library (). Students independently prepared for these sessions
   by reviewing cases, slides, readings, and questions in advance
   (asynchronous self-directed learning anchored on a flipped classroom
   model), and wrote a final review of a case. An assessment and feedback
   were given to each student. Results Four elective iterations were
   offered to a total of 29 students, with learners and faculty spread over
   4 countries. During the Zoom sessions, students controlled the digital
   slides and offered their own diagnoses, followed by group discussions to
   strengthen autonomy and confidence. We surveyed learners about the
   elective's performance (program evaluation). Students conveyed high
   levels of satisfaction about the elective's overall quality, their
   pathology learning and online interactions, with minimal challenges
   related to the remote nature of the course. Discussion and Conclusions
   Technological innovations mitigate sudden disruptions in medical
   education. A remote curriculum allows instruction at any distance, at
   any time, from anywhere, enhancing educational exchanges, flexibility
   and globalization in medical education.},

Abstract = {The paper presents the results of a research based on the evaluation
   culture approach and particularly on the social corporate responsibility
   of universities and their duty to account for the quality of their
   mission, researches, teaching and dissemination of knowledge. Metrics
   and international rankings have been developed to measure value and
   performance of the universities; as a consequence, the academic world
   must express appropriate means in order to improve its position in
   quality evaluation rankings. The research project focuses on ``La
   Sapienza{''} University of Rome and especially on international rankings
   and metrics used to measure its degree of information literacy. The
   indicators that would take advantage of a program devoted to digital
   competences are here listed and analyzed to underline: a) the
   instructional plan, based on the cooperation between
   researchers-professors and librarians; connectivism as a pedagogical
   concept; the flipped classroom methodology; the necessity of taking into
   due account visual competencies and social networks; Educational Digital
   Objects as Web didactic materials; b) the educational plan meant to
   enhance visual competences, given the relevance of virtual and augmented
   reality for university education. The best Visual Literacy standards are
   selected to empower iconic and visual reading and to envision effective
   goals, learning units, methodology and quality. The evaluation must then
   be considered as one of the principal results of the research itself: it
   must be based on competencies and quality, and the 13 indicators
   suggested to measure the educational program - feedback and other
   metrics included - will be of great use to help the University to
   highlight its quality standards.},

   review and the education program implemented at Jichi Medical University},
Journal = {JOURNAL OF MEDICAL ULTRASONICS},
Abstract = {The concept of point-of-care ultrasound has been widely accepted owing
   to the development of portable ultrasound systems and growing body of
   evidence concerning its extensive utility. Thus, it is reasonable to
   suggest that training to use this modality be included in undergraduate
   medical education. Training in ultrasonography helps medical students
   learn basic subjects such as anatomy and physiology, improve their
   physical examination skills, and acquire diagnostic and procedural
   skills. Technological advances such as simulators, affordable handheld
   devices, and tele-ultrasound systems can facilitate undergraduate
   ultrasound education. Several reports have indicated that some medical
   schools have integrated ultrasound training into their undergraduate
   medical curricula. Jichi Medical University in Japan has been providing
   medical students with ultrasound education to fulfill part of its
   mission to provide medical care to rural areas. Vertical integration of
   ultrasound education into a curriculum seems reasonable to ensure skill
   retention and improvement. However, several issues have hampered the
   integration of ultrasound into medical education, including a lack of
   trained faculty, the need to recruit human models, requisition of
   ultrasound machines for training, and limited curricular space; proposed
   solutions include peer teaching, students as trained simulated patients,
   the development of more affordable handheld devices, and a flipped
   classroom approach with access to an e-learning platform, respectively.
   A curriculum should be developed through multidisciplinary and bottom-up
   student-initiated approaches. Formulating national and international
   consensuses concerning the milestones and curricula can promote the
   incorporation of ultrasound training into undergraduate medical
   education at the national level.},

Title = {``Game on!{''} Teaching gamification principles for library instruction
   to health sciences information professionals using interactive, low-tech
   activities and design-thinking modalities},
Journal = {JOURNAL OF THE MEDICAL LIBRARY ASSOCIATION},

Volume = {107},

Month = {OCT},
Abstract = {Background: Gamification is correlated with increased motivation and
   engagement of learners and is increasingly being incorporated into
   library instruction. Opportunities for librarians to learn and practice
   principles of gamification can be helpful for those desiring to
   incorporate gamification into instruction. This report describes the
   development and delivery of an interactive special content session at
   MLA `18, the 2018 Medical Library Association annual meeting in Atlanta,
   Georgia, focusing on principles of low-tech game design for health
   sciences library classroom instruction.
   Case Presentation: The special content session, titled ``Design, Play,
   Learn: A Special Content Session to Design a Game for Database
   Instruction,{''} was designed and delivered using multimodal instruction
   (e.g., flipped classroom, didactic component, active learning) that also
   incorporated principles of design thinking. A pre- and post-survey was
   given to all participants at the beginning and end of the session to
   measure confidence and desire to incorporate gamification into
   instruction and as a formative feedback indicator for instructors.
   Participants reported increased confidence and desire to use games for
   library instruction after participating in the session. A selection of
   games was uploaded to a shared content folder designed for course
   participants as an ongoing repository for ideas and communication.
   Conclusions: For librarians who are interested in incorporating
   principles of gamification into library instruction, attending a
   relatively short hands-on workshop can facilitate learning and
   confidence around prototyping and creating games for use in library
   instruction. We intend to improve upon the workshop and offer it again
   in additional contexts, based on direct observations of the session and
   participant feedback.},

Title = {Blended learning to teach gender in medical school},
Journal = {CLINICAL TEACHER},
Year = {2018},
Volume = {15},
Number = {3},
Pages = {208-213},
Month = {JUN},
Abstract = {Background: Teaching gender and sexuality in medical school is critical
   to prepare students for future clinical practice. Yet curriculum gaps
   exist in teaching these topics in medical schools. To address this,
   medical schools are integrating gendered perspectives into their
   curricula.
   Context: Acknowledging the need to teach gender and sexuality, Western
   Sydney University School of Medicine introduced a lecture on ``Gendered
   Perspectives on Health' in 2015. However, the delivery of the content
   took more time than anticipated, as some students lacked a basic
   understanding of gender and sexuality. Engagement with the didactic
   teaching method was low.
   Innovation: Using blended learning techniques, a flipped classroom
   workshop on gender and sexuality was developed in 2016. The workshop had
   online components that gave basic information on gender and sexuality,
   which students viewed prior to the face-to-face session. Students then
   discussed specific gender-related topics with expert facilitators using
   a timed multi-station approach during the face-to-face session. A
   plenary session provided students with the opportunity to address any
   remaining questions. Evaluation suggests that the workshop increased the
   students' self-reported knowledge on gender and sexual health topics and
   services. Students also found the workshop useful and engaging.
   Implications: The workshop provided an engaging and informative way for
   students to discuss gender and sexuality. The workshop also created a
   safe learning environment for students to clarify their perceptions of
   gender and sexuality. Increasing students' knowledge and understanding
   of gender and sexuality promoted a gender-sensitive approach to patient
   care, which can help students to avoid stereotyping and to provide
   comprehensive care to gender-diverse groups.},

Title = {Let me explain! The effects of writing and reading short justifications
   on students' performance, confidence and opinions in audience response
   systems},

Abstract = {Background The feedback offered to students in audience response systems
   may enhance conformity bias, while asking closed-type questions alone
   does not allow students to externalize and elaborate on their knowledge.
   Objectives The study explores how writing short justifications and
   accessing peer justifications as collective feedback could affect
   students' performance, confidence and opinions in multiple-choice
   audience response systems that apply the Peer Instruction model of
   voting/revoting. Methods For 8 weeks, 98 students, enrolled in an
   undergraduate course, attended each lecture following a flipped
   classroom approach. At the beginning of each lecture, students
   participated in a quiz with eight multiple-choice questions. Four of
   these questions included a justification form in which students could
   elaborate on their answers. The students were randomly grouped into two
   conditions according to the collective feedback they received: the
   Shared group (n = 54) could see both the percentage each question choice
   received from the class and the respective peer justifications, while
   the Unshared group (n = 44) could only see the percentage information.
   Results Analysis showed that students in both groups performed
   significantly better in questions with the justification form being
   available. Also, the two groups were comparable in terms of performance
   and self-reported level of confidence suggesting no main effect for
   making peer justification available. Despite this, students in the
   Shared group expressed a significantly more positive opinion in the
   end-of-activity questionnaire in terms of perceived learning gains and
   the helpfulness of writing justifications for their answers. Take Away
   Writing short justifications can have a positive impact on students'
   academic performance.},

Title = {Neuroanatomy, the Achille's Heel of Medical Students. A Systematic
   Analysis of Educational Strategies for the Teaching of Neuroanatomy},

Abstract = {Neuroanatomy has been deemed crucial for clinical neurosciences. It has
   been one of the most challenging parts of the anatomical curriculum and
   is one of the causes of ``neurophobia,{''} whose main implication is a
   negative influence on the choice of neurology in the near future. In the
   last decades, several educational strategies have been identified to
   improve the skills of students and to promote a deep learning. The aim
   of this study was to systematically review the literature to identify
   the most effective method/s to teach human neuroanatomy. The search was
   restricted to publications written in English language and to articles
   describing teaching tools in undergraduate medical courses from January
   2006 through December 2017. The primary outcome was the observation of
   improvement of anatomical knowledge in undergraduate medical students.
   Secondary outcomes were the amelioration of long-term retention
   knowledge and the grade of satisfaction of students. Among 18 selected
   studies, 44.4\% have used three-dimensional (3D) teaching tools, 16.6\%
   near peer teaching tool, 5.55\% flipped classroom tool, 5.55\% applied
   neuroanatomy elective course, 5.55\% equivalence-based instruction-rote
   learning, 5.55\% mobile augmented reality, 5.55\% inquiry-based clinical
   case, 5.55\% cadaver dissection, and 5.55\% Twitter. The high in-between
   study heterogeneity was the main issue to identify the most helpful
   teaching tool to improve neuroanatomical knowledge among medical
   students. Data from this study suggest that a combination of multiple
   pedagogical resources seems to be the more advantageous for teaching
   neuroanatomy.},

Abstract = {Students learn and process information in many different ways. Learning
   styles are useful as they allow instructors to learn more about
   students, as well as aid in the development and application of useful
   teaching approaches and techniques. At the undergraduate level there is
   a noticeable lack of research on learning style preferences of students
   enrolled in gross anatomy courses. The Index of Learning Styles (ILS)
   questionnaire was administered to students enrolled in a large
   enrollment undergraduate gross anatomy course with laboratory to
   determine their preferred learning styles. The predominant preferred
   learning styles of the students (n=505) enrolled in the gross anatomy
   course were active (54.9\%), sensing (85.1\%), visual (81.2\%), and
   sequential (74.4\%). Preferred learning styles profiles of particular
   majors enrolled in the course were also constructed; analyses showed
   minor variation in the active/reflective dimension. An understanding of
   students' preferred learning styles can guide course design but it
   should not be implemented in isolation. It can be strengthened (or
   weakened) by concurrent use of other tools (e.g., flipped classroom
   course design). Based on the preferred learning styles of the majority
   of undergraduate students in this particular gross anatomy course,
   course activities can be hands on (i.e., active), grounded in concrete
   information (i.e., sensing), utilize visual representation such as
   images, figures, models, etc. (i.e., visual), and move in small
   incremental steps that build on each topic (i.e., sequential). Anat Sci

Abstract = {Background Active participation in group assignments is an invaluable
   way to realize collaborative learning; however, there are several
   challenges attributed to the traditional way of doing group assignments.
   This study explores the synergistic effects of flipped classrooms and a
   wiki-authoring group activity on students' learning outcomes and the
   quality and quantity of their group-work. Methods In this action
   research, 205 master students of a medical school were involved in a
   course blended with flipped classrooms. While learning from online and
   in-class activities, students did their group assignment on an
   educational wiki (n = 85) or in a conventional way (n = 120). Assessment
   in this study was done in both formative and summative ways. Formative
   assessment included quizzes at the beginning of each class and students'
   self-assessment (focused on their satisfaction with different
   educational activities of the course, using an 11-item validated
   satisfaction questionnaire). The summative assessment incorporated
   assessment of the quantity and quality of students' participation in
   doing group assignments(by a five-item checklist); quizzes at the end of
   each class; the final exam; assessment of students' competency in
   transferring their learning into creating an outline for a hypothetical
   article and writing topic sentences. Using SPSS 21.0 and employing
   independent samples t or Mann -Whitney U tests, the educational impacts
   of the course were compared in two groups. Results Students in the
   wiki-group were more satisfied with the course. Both quantity and
   quality of the group assignment among students in the wiki group
   outweighed those among the students in the non-wiki group. Univariate
   linear regression analysis of the models between students' satisfaction
   with flipped classrooms and the quality of their participation in doing
   their group as well as their attitude towards the group assignment
   showed that the changes in the quality of the wiki students' group
   assignment and their attitude were dependent on the changes of their
   satisfaction with flipped classrooms. Conclusions The findings of this
   study confirm that a wiki-authoring group assignment is effective in
   achieving student learning outcomes and integrating a wiki with flipped
   classrooms increases wiki accomplishment. Collaborating on a wiki
   activity improves both quality and quantity of group assignments among
   students.},

Abstract = {The aim of this research was to analyze the teaching experience of
   Physical Education teachers in their classes during COVID-19 confinement
   in Mexico.This is a descriptive and cross-sectional study with a mixed
   approach; participants were 79 Physical Education teachers at public
   elementary schools, in the State of Chihuahua, Mexico; 52 males and 27
   females (M-age = 40.3, SD= 8.2); With teaching experiences (M-years =
   14.1, SD= 7.6) , 12.7\% at preschool level, 83.5\% at primary, 3.8\% at
   secondary 60.8\% in schools located in urban areas, and 39.2\% in rural
   areas .The variables of didactic strategies, learning assessment,
   teacher resilience, effects of COVID-19 confinement on the students, and
   training required by teachers were analyzed; For this purpose, an ad hoc
   instrument was designed and applied, which consists of 13 items.The
   results indicated that most teachers used the flipped classroom
   methodology and taught virtual classes, the evaluation was complex and
   challenging, however, they developed attitudes and values of tolerance
   and empathy, as well as skills in ICT, they were also able to identify
   the possibilities of psychological problems appeared in their students,
   some teachers mentioned the need for training in pedagogy, ICT and
   recommendations for action when returning to face-to-face classes. It
   was concluded that Physical Education teachers are faced with various
   challenges in their class; however, teachers' resilience manifested with
   patience, empathy, and the development of ICT skills allowed them to
   carry out their work.},

Abstract = {Purpose - This study intends to examine these misconceptions in a bid to
   reaching a valid conclusion. More importantly, this study intends to
   elicit information from instructors and preservice teachers on their
   experiences, successes and challenges on the sudden switch from flipped
   classroom to emergency remote online teaching.
   Design/methodology/approach - The study adopted a qualitative research
   design and the main focus of this research design which was is a form of
   exploratory research design was to understand the reasons opinions and
   viewpoints of a particular group of people concerning a situation. This
   paper deems this research design fit for eliciting relevant information
   from instructors and preservice teachers on their opinions and
   perceptions on the sudden shift from flipped classrooms to emergency
   remote online teaching during the previous semester. Data collection for
   this study was carried out through the use of focus group discussions
   where participants were asked questions based on the objective of the
   study.
   Findings - The present findings confirm that the mode of instruction
   delivery was not online teaching rather emergency remote online
   teaching. Another conclusion that was drawn was with regards to
   training, use of resources and issues of measurement and evaluation. The
   study summarized that there was little or no training for the teaching
   staff before the switch to EROT as instructors were only given
   guidelines on what to do to implement their lesson plans.
   Originality/value - Emergency remote online teaching is a newly emerging
   approach to lesson delivery, especially in an emergency situation. This
   study elaborates more on this new dimension of teaching and future
   prospects as well.},

Title = {Blended learning of radiology improves medical students' performance,

Abstract = {Purpose To evaluate the impact of blended learning using a combination
   of educational resources (flipped classroom and short videos) on medical
   students' (MSs) for radiology learning. Material and methods A cohort of
   353 MSs from 2015 to 2018 was prospectively evaluated. MSs were assigned
   to four groups (high, high-intermediate, low-intermediate, and low
   achievers) based on their results to a 20-MCQs performance evaluation
   referred to as the pretest. MSs had then free access to a self-paced
   course totalizing 61 videos based on abdominal imaging over a period of
   3 months. Performance was evaluated using the change between posttest
   (the same 20 MCQs as pretest) and pretest results. Satisfaction was
   measured using a satisfaction survey with directed and spontaneous
   feedbacks. Engagement was graded according to audience retention and
   attendance on a web content management system. Results Performance
   change between pre and posttest was significantly different between the
   four categories (ANOVA, P = 10(-9)): low pretest achievers demonstrated
   the highest improvement (mean +/- SD, + 11.3 +/- 22.8 points) while high
   pretest achievers showed a decrease in their posttest score (mean +/-
   SD, - 3.6 +/- 19 points). Directed feedback collected from 73.3\% of
   participants showed a 99\% of overall satisfaction. Spontaneous feedback
   showed that the concept of ``pleasure in learning{''} was the most cited
   advantage, followed by ``flexibility.{''} Engagement increased over
   years and the number of views increased of 2.47-fold in 2 years.
   Conclusion Learning formats including new pedagogical concepts as
   blended learning, and current technologies allow improvement in medical
   student's performance, satisfaction, and engagement.},

Abstract = {Introduction: Pharmacy student-perceived stress may impact academic
   experiences. This research aimed to investigate whether there was an
   increase in student-perceived stress due to the COVID-19 pandemic.
   Methods: Current pharmacy students were surveyed in May 2020 at a public
   pharmacy school that utilizes an active learning design and follows a
   flipped classroom approach. In addition to measuring perceived stress,
   the survey measured coping behaviors, self-efficacy, and emotional
   status. The collected data were compared with archived data that were
   collected for internal use in 2018. Student's t-test analyses were used
   to compare 2020 with 2018 data.
   Results: A total of 66 students completed the 2020 survey (response rate
   26.2\%) and 192 students completed the 2018 survey (response rate
   63.2\%). On a scale from 0 (never or not applicable) to 5 (multiple
   times each day), average student-perceived stress was 1.75 (SD = 0.93)
   in 2020. This value of perceived stress presented a slight, but not
   statistically significant, reduction from 1.85 (SD = 1.04) in 2018.
   Comparing 2018 and 2020 datasets showed no significant differences in
   coping behavior, self-efficacy, or emotional status.
   Conclusions: Based on the sample with the lower response rate that
   completed the survey in 2020, student-perceived stress did not increase
   during online, remote learning associated with the COVID-19 pandemic as
   compared to the sample with a higher response rate prior to the
   pandemic. Perhaps the COVID-19 related changes were seamless to students
   due to their aptitude for remote, online learning. (C) 2021 Published by

Title = {The role of motivation, ability, and opportunity in university teachers'
   continuance use intention for flipped teaching},

Abstract = {On-site teaching practice is changing due to the development of digital
   technology. Traditional lecturing has long focused on instructor-based
   teaching but now has transitioned to a flipped classroom that emphasizes
   student learning. In the past, quasi-experimental methods or qualitative
   interviews were primarily used to explore learner? learning performance,
   learning satisfaction, and the interaction between teachers and
   students. Studies on teacher? points of view are rare, as are studies on
   factors that influence teachers to continue flipped teaching. Thus, the
   empirical results of this innovative teaching strategy must be assessed
   to confirm the expectations of practice and theory. Drawing on theories
   of self-determination and motivation-opportunity ability, this paper
   proposes and empirically supports the notion that teacher? motivational
   factors, perceived self-efficacy, and supportive flipped teaching
   resources interact to perpetuate flipped teaching in the higher
   education context. To test the proposed research model, a survey was
   conducted among 169 university teachers. The results indicate that
   intrinsic challenge motivation and extrinsic compensation motivation are
   critical predictors of teacher? continuance use intention for flipped
   teaching. Perceived self-efficacy was also shown to critically moderate
   teachers' continuance use intention for flipped teaching. Specifically,
   when teachers have high perceived self-efficacy, challenge motivation
   leads to continuance use intention. Conversely, when teachers have low
   perceived self-efficacy, compensation motivation leads to continuance
   intention. Further, the results also suggest that teachers' continuance
   use intention for flipped teaching is highest when challenge motivation,
   perceived self-efficacy, and supportive flipped teaching resources are
   all sufficient and mutually reinforcing.},

Abstract = {Given that most humanities courses in higher education are already
   interactive and constructive, it is not clear whether a flipped model of
   learning adds any additional value to student learning. This study
   assessed the impacts of flipped learning on EFL learners' performance
   and perceptions of a two-semester linguistics course in a Taiwan
   university. For the flipped units, EFL students learning linguistics in
   the partially flipped classroom viewed instructor-made videos prior to
   the scheduled class and then participated in class activities, which
   required analysis and evaluation of the concepts acquired from the
   videos to solve real-world problems. For other units, students
   experienced learning via live lectures. Student responses from a
   questionnaire indicated that the flipped model promoted higher-order
   thinking and made differentiated and self-paced learning possible. Video
   lectures were favored over textbook chapters, but not over live
   lectures. The results of correlational analyses between questionnaire
   items and exam performance indicated that success in flipped learning
   depends on students' appreciation of the cohesive alignment of
   prerecorded lectures and in-class activities to support learning and
   investing time in video lectures. There was no evidence that devoting
   28\% less class time to transmitting knowledge over the two semesters
   impaired exam performance in the flipped students when compared to the
   students taking the same course but with live lectures in the previous
   year. This article calls for a careful reexamination of how to balance
   the use of flipped learning and live lectures in humanities disciplines
   in higher education.},

Title = {Using spoken dialogue technology for L2 speaking practice: what do
   teachers think?},
Journal = {COMPUTER ASSISTED LANGUAGE LEARNING},
Abstract = {Often, second/foreign (L2) language learners receive little opportunity
   to interact orally in the target language. Interactive,
   conversation-based spoken dialog systems (SDSs) that use automated
   speech recognition and natural language processing have the potential to
   address this need by engaging learners in meaningful, goal-oriented
   speaking practice. However, these technology-based learning tools are
   often developed without input from teaching professionals. As part of a
   larger development effort, this study examined English as a second
   language (ESL) teachers' perceptions regarding SDS-based speaking tasks,
   addressing the following research questions: (a) What do teachers think
   about the SDS-based tasks? (b) How would they use them in the context of
   their English instruction? Overall, 16 ESL instructors in an intensive
   English program in the United States were asked to interact with four
   SDS-based speaking tasks designed to elicit specific linguistic
   phenomena (e.g. making requests; wh-questions). The teachers completed a
   survey after each task to gauge their user experience, level of
   engagement, and perceptions of the usefulness of the tasks for their
   teaching contexts. A subgroup of instructors (n = 7) also participated
   in audio-recorded focus group meetings. Descriptive statistics were
   calculated for each survey item and the open-ended responses from the
   surveys and focus groups were analyzed qualitatively for major themes.
   The findings show that teachers had positive views of the SDS tasks'
   potential for speaking practice and diagnostic purposes, primarily in a
   flipped classroom model. Their perceptions seemed to be related to their
   own user experience and, in particular, to the perceived authenticity of
   a given task.},

Abstract = {Background: Role modelling is a fundamental method by which students
   learn from residents. To our knowledge, however, resident-as-teacher
   curricula have not explicitly addressed resident role modelling. The
   purpose of this project was to design, implement and evaluate an
   innovative programme to teach residents about role modelling.
   Methods: The authors designed a resident role-modelling programme and
   incorporated it into the 2015 and 2016 McGill University
   resident-as-teacher curriculum. Influenced by experiential and social
   learning theories, the programme incorporated flipped-classroom and
   simulation approaches to teach residents to be aware and deliberate role
   models. Outcomes were assessed through a pre- and immediate
   post-programme questionnaire evaluating reaction and learning, a delayed
   post-programme questionnaire evaluating learning, and a retrospective
   pre-post questionnaire (1 month following the programme) evaluating
   self-reported behaviour changes.
   Results: Thirty-three of 38 (87\%) residents who participated in the
   programme completed the evaluation, with 25 residents (66\%) completing
   all questionnaires. Participants rated the programme highly on a
   five-point Likert scale (where 1=not helpful and 5=very helpful; mean
   score, M=4.57; standard deviation, SD=0.50), and showed significant
   improvement in their perceptions of their importance as role models and
   their knowledge of deliberate role modelling. Residents also reported an
   increased use of deliberate role-modelling strategies 1 month after
   completing the programme.
   Discussion: The incorporation of resident role modelling into our
   resident-as-teacher curriculum positively influenced the participants'
   perceptions of their role-modelling abilities. This programme responds
   to a gap in resident training and has the potential to guide further
   programme development in this important and often overlooked area.},

Title = {The effect of online and in-person team-based learning (TBL) on
   undergraduate endocrinology teaching during COVID-19 pandemic},
Journal = {BMC MEDICAL EDUCATION},
Year = {2022},

Abstract = {Background Team-based learning (TBL) combines active and collaborative
   learning, while incorporating aspects of the flipped classroom approach
   and problem-based learning. The COVID-19 pandemic presented certain
   challenges in the delivery of TBL in class. In this study, we
   investigated the impact of TBL on the academic performance of final year
   Biomedical Sciences' undergraduate students in the context of an
   ``Endocrine Disorders{''} study block. We did so by comparing the
   classical in-person approach and online delivery due to the COVID-19
   pandemic. Methods A non-compulsory TBL session was introduced to the
   curriculum of this block, which followed the traditional 2-h lecture
   delivery. Comparative analysis was performed for the exam and coursework
   performance of students who attended the TBL sessions (online and
   in-person) and those that did not. Results Both cohorts of students who
   attended either in-person (n = 66) or online TBL sessions (n = 109)
   performed significantly better in their exams (p < 0.05) and a related
   coursework (p < 0.001 and p < 0.05, respectively) when compared to those
   that did not attend. For both these cohorts the exam mark distribution
   was much narrower compared to those that did not attend the TBL sessions
   where the majority of fails and ``no shows{''} were recorded.
   Conclusions Online and in-person TBL, can successfully supplement
   traditional lecture-based teaching and enhance the learning/performance,
   for complex medical subjects/topics. Our findings demonstrate that it is
   possible to deliver these sessions online with demonstrable benefit for
   students suggesting that there is greater flexibility in the use of TBL
   in higher education.},

Title = {Integrating iPads into Team-Based Learning in the Pediatrics Clerkship:
   Do They Provide Any Value?},
Journal = {JOURNAL OF MEDICAL EDUCATION AND CURRICULAR DEVELOPMENT},
Year = {2020},
Volume = {7},
Month = {SEP},
Abstract = {Background: Team-Based Learning (TBL) is an instructional strategy that
   embraces the concept of a flipped classroom. At our institution, the
   Clerkship in Pediatrics utilizes TBL sessions to deliver curricular
   content rather than lecture format. In 2016, matriculating medical
   students were given iPads for the purpose of transitioning to electronic
   delivery of curricular materials in the pre-clinical phase of their
   study. In 2017, the Clerkship in Pediatrics was tasked with
   investigating methods to integrate iPad use into clinical education.
   Activity: We employed the web-based platform Examplify to deliver test
   questions for TBL sessions over the span of 1 academic year (2018-2019).
   Curricular content was converted to Examplify for half of the TBL
   sessions and team performance for the sessions was compared to those
   administered traditionally. Students participating in the course were
   surveyed regarding their satisfaction with the 2 formats using a 15-item
   survey with a 4-point rating scale and open-ended questions.
   Results and discussion: Integration of technology into TBL sessions was
   met with mixed results. Performance on the eTBL sessions was
   significantly higher for 2 of the 6 sessions: the Abdominal Pain (90.2\%
   vs 84.1\%,P = .04) and the Toxicology (85.6\% vs 79.4\%,P = .03)
   sessions. A majority of students felt that the eTBL sessions facilitated
   multiple learning styles, promoted discussions, and nurtured different
   learning styles. However, students also felt that the electronic
   sessions were more cumbersome and difficult to navigate. Future research
   comparing the 2 modalities using a more comprehensive integration of
   media content, such as video and audio files, will further inform the
   success of this endeavor.},

Abstract = {The teaching effectiveness of China's university design theory course
   has not undergone any major reforms in recent years to keep pace with
   new technology, modern teaching methodologies or student expectations.
   This is mainly due to the traditional approach of emphasizing practice
   rather than design theory and is inherent in design education in China,
   a view supported by design major students. The key to solve this problem
   is to effectively match and link the design theory course with universal
   practice in the world today. Therefore, endogenous, autonomous, targeted
   and unique design theory course practice resources and platforms are
   extremely important. This paper empirically takes the design theory
   course of ``Advertising Copywriting{''} as the case study and introduces
   Micro-lecture. This is advocated by China's Ministry of Education to
   achieve accurate imparting of core knowledge points of the design
   theoretical contents. At the same time, it combines five new stratified
   progressive multiple teaching approaches namely: meta-cognitive,
   self-inspiration, research-discussion, flipped classroom and scholarly
   exploration to effectively improve the course teaching form and enrich
   classroom activities. In addition, this paper recommends the
   implementation of the ``Maker{''} practice including real time projects
   as well as training Maker ideology. ``3M Model: Multiple innovative
   pedagogies, Micro-lecture and Maker practice{''} performability creative
   practical platform application is aimed to fundamentally improve
   teaching quality management performability and change the less effective
   present teaching situation of the design theory course with a
   comprehensive reform of the situational, pluralistic and practical
   course teaching content, form and structure. It provides a reference for
   the comprehensive promotion of teaching reform with a detailed case
   analysis and demonstration.},

Journal = {SMART LEARNING ENVIRONMENTS},

Abstract = {It is widely recognized that feedback is important for the improvement
   of second language (L2) writing skills; however, teachers are facing
   challenges in providing sufficient and quick feedback on students'
   written works. This study proposes to employ the flipped classroom
   approach and peer feedback in L2 writing classes. Though previous
   studies provided sufficient theoretical frameworks and design guidelines
   in both fields, there is still a lack of actionable process designs
   specifically for L2 writing that combine flipped learning and peer
   feedback. To address the aforementioned gaps, this article uses a
   `design thinking' approach to establish a framework named the Flipped
   Learning Wheel (FLW), which contains the components and principles of a
   typical flipped learning class. To achieve collaborative and reflective
   learning, which have been rarely specified in previous flipped learning
   research, this study involves the jigsaw technique and process writing
   approach in the design. The paper presents a detailed explanation of the
   FLW implementation process in L2 writing classes that contains 18 steps.
   We also interviewed eight L2 writing teachers about their perceptions on
   the FLW framework's feasibility in practice. Respondents report that the
   teaching process is specific, actionable and feasible for real-life
   teaching, which also leaves sufficient freedom for teachers to make
   adjustments. However, more attention should be paid to classroom
   management, class size and teacher competence. The FLW framework and
   implementation process presented in this article can be directly used,
   adapted or reshaped by L2 writing teachers for students with middle and
   upper language ability. Future studies can also implement this process
   design in practice and test its impact on writing ability and
   engagement.},

Title = {Evaluation of integrated modular teaching in Chinese ophthalmology
   trainee courses},
Journal = {BMC MEDICAL EDUCATION},

Abstract = {Background Before attending ophthalmology trainee courses in Zhongshan
   Ophthalmic Centre, the medical students from Sun Yat-sen University had
   finished two years of premedical education after the six-year medical
   courses including basic medical courses, clinical medical courses,
   clerkship, and research training in medical college. Integrated modular
   teaching using different problem-based teaching methods in ophthalmology
   was designed by the teaching steering committee of Zhongshan Ophthalmic
   Centre. This study aimed to evaluate the effectiveness and satisfaction
   scales of the integrated modular teaching among the trainee students.
   Methods A total of 100 medical students attending ophthalmology trainee
   courses in Zhongshan Ophthalmic Centre were enrolled and randomly
   allocated into 4 groups according to the teaching arrangement. The
   trainee courses consisted of several sessions delivered in multiple
   methods, such as ``flipped classroom{''} session and team-based learning
   session. The pre- and post-class tests were delivered to evaluate the
   effectiveness of the integrated modular teaching. The satisfaction
   survey questionnaire was collected from all participants to investigate
   the degree of satisfaction. Results Compared with the first-day-test
   score, the total last-day-test score was significantly improved by a
   paired t-test (t = 3.288, P = 0.001). Nineteen students obtained a
   significant improvement in ranking increased by more than 10 in the
   last-day-test, whereas they failed to obtain a higher average score for
   daily performance than other students (t = 0.469, P = 0.654). According
   to the participant satisfaction questionnaires, these innovative
   teaching methods were considered as effective and satisfactory.
   Conclusions Integrated modular teaching in ophthalmology trainee courses
   is effective and appreciated by the medical college students.},

Abstract = {Aim People with developmental disabilities (DDs) experience significant
   barriers accessing and receiving optimal health care resulting in poorer
   health-care outcomes. Continuing professional development (CPD)
   represents an effective means to alter health-care staff behaviour to
   improve the care of people with DDs. However, given the scepticism
   regarding the effectiveness of certain CPD models' ability to alter
   learner's workplace behaviour, the current pilot study developed and
   determined the feasibility of a novel CPD programme aimed at improving
   the health care provided to children with DDs. Methods Motivation for
   Change (MFC) is a novel CPD programme based on empirically based
   behaviour and educational strategies including motivational
   interviewing, flipped classroom and process mapping. It utilises input
   of patients, practitioners, and family members during administration of
   the programme. MFC was administered with 14 staff members in a Sydney
   Children's Hospital Sleep service. Results After MFC engagement, staff
   reported significant improvements in their knowledge of behavioural
   characteristics of children with DDs, the difficulties they face, how
   best to support them within the learner's work setting and confidence in
   working with children with DDs. There was a non-significant decline in
   their reported need for further training and expressed high level of
   satisfaction with the MFC programme. Conclusion MFC represents a
   feasible means of providing CPD to health-care staff but further
   research is needed to determine objective clinical behavioural change.
   Evaluation of the impact on patient health outcomes, parent/child
   satisfaction, staff sustainability and overall system functioning is
   also needed. It may represent an effective model of CPD for other
   targets of health-care improvement.},

Title = {Effectiveness of the Adolescent Medicine Rotation in Improving Pediatric
   Residents Self-Assessed Skill and Confidence Caring for Youth},

Abstract = {Purpose: Practicing and resident pediatricians report inadequate skill
   in caring for adolescents, despite adolescents comprising roughly
   one-quarter of most general and subspecialty practices. This study
   examined the effectiveness of participation in an adolescent medicine
   rotation at improving pediatric residents' self-perceived skills and
   confidence across nine key adolescent health domains. We also evaluated
   the impact of didactic instruction during the rotation.
   Methods: Resident and recent-graduate participants (n=34) completed
   milestone-based self-assessment of their skill and confidence caring for
   adolescent patients in nine key adolescent health-related domains. This
   study employed a post-test then retrospective pretest, an educational
   study design used to minimize response-shift bias whereby participants
   rate their skill and confidence at the end of the intervention
   (post-test), and then reflect back to retrospectively rate their
   preintervention skill (retrospective pretest). Additionally, differences
   in gains between those who did and did not participate in didactic
   instruction were evaluated. Didactic instruction was delivered during
   the adolescent medicine rotation utilizing a flipped-classroom model;
   participants received standardized preparatory materials and
   participated in active-learning workshops.
   Results: Participants demonstrated a significant (p=.0001) increase in
   self-perceived skill levels for all assessed domains after the rotation
   as compared to before the rotation, whether or not they received
   didactic instruction. Participation in didactic instruction did not
   yield significant (p=.05) additional benefit for any of the assessed
   domains.
   Conclusions: Participation in an adolescent medicine rotation is of
   value to pediatric resident trainees and leads to increased
   self-assessed skill and confidence in caring for youth. Published by
   Elsevier Inc. on behalf of Society for Adolescent Health and Medicine.},

Title = {Medical Student Education During the COVID-19 Pandemic: Initial
   Experiences Implementing a Virtual Interventional Radiology Elective
   Course},
Journal = {ACADEMIC RADIOLOGY},
Year = {2021},
Volume = {28},
Number = {1},
Pages = {128-135},
Month = {JAN},
Abstract = {Rationale and objectives: In response to the COVID-19 pandemic reducing
   medical student presence on clinical services and in classrooms,
   academic institutions are utilizing a virtual format to continue medical
   student education. We describe a successful initial experience
   implementing a virtual elective in interventional radiology (IR) and
   provide the course framework, student feedback, and potential
   improvements.
   Materials and methods: A 2-week virtual IR elective curriculum was
   created utilizing a combination of synchronous and asynchronous learning
   and the ``flipped{''} classroom educational model. Students virtually
   participated in daily IR resident education conferences, resident-led
   case review sessions, and dedicated lectures. Asynchronous prelearning
   material consisted of text and video correlating to lecture topics.
   Anonymous precourse and postcourse surveys were sent to all
   participating students (n =10).
   Results: Ten students (100\%) completed precourse and seven (70\%)
   completed postcourse surveys. Enrolled students were considering
   residencies in surgery (50\%), internal medicine (40\%), interventional
   radiology (30\%), and/or diagnostic radiology (30\%). Students'
   understanding of what IRs do and the procedures they perform (p <
   0.001), when to consult IR for assistance in patient management (p =
   0.005), and the number of IR procedures students could recall (p =
   0.015) improved after the course. Case-review sessions and virtual
   lectures ranked as having the highest education value. Students
   recommended additional small-group case workshops.
   Conclusion: This successful virtual IR elective provides a framework for
   others to continue IR medical student education during the pandemic and
   grow the specialty's presence within an increasingly virtual medical
   school curriculum. The described model may be modified to improve IR
   education beyond the COVID-19 era.},

Abstract = {COVID-19 has resulted in an expansion of webinar-based teaching
   globally. Socially distanced e-learning is the new normal. The delivery
   of regional OMFS teaching programmes in the UK and the Republic of
   Ireland, for Specialty Trainees (ST's) under the Joint Committee on
   Surgical Training (JCST) and Intercollegiate Surgical Curriculum
   Programme (ISCP) umbrellas is variable. We recognised the need to
   provide additional teaching to supplement this teaching, at a time of
   crisis in our countries and healthcare systems, which had jointly led to
   a significant impact on the progression of training. The membership
   category of Specialty Trainees within the national specialty
   association-the British Association of Oral and Maxillofacial Surgeons
   (BAOMS) is Fellows in Training abbreviated to FiT. We designed an OMFS
   FiT (Fellows in Training) webinar series based on the current Oral and
   Maxillofacial Surgery (OMFS) curriculum. Senior trainers delivered
   weekly national web-based teaching using learning theories of education.
   Thirteen webinars were conducted between the 14th of May and the 4th of
   August 2020. Webinars were attended by 40-75 ST's with 98 percent of
   trainees rating the webinars as `excellent' or `very good', and 99\%
   found the content `extremely useful' or `very useful'. We discuss the
   learning theories used for this teaching which include - Bloom's
   taxonomy, Bruner's spiral model, Vygotsky's zone of proximal
   development, the flipped classroom model, and Knowles' andragogy model.
   This pilot national teaching programme has been extremely well received
   by OMFS trainees and is here to stayl (C) 2021 The British Association

Title = {A hemodialysis curriculum for nephrology fellows using a blended

Abstract = {A comprehensive, hands-on hemodialysis curriculum during nephrology
   training is necessary for effective learning and optimal patient care.
   Traditional instructive approaches are unable to fully meet the needs of
   the digitally inclined learner and are limited by time constraints and
   increasing clinical workload. Internet based learning (E-learning) is
   becoming increasingly popular in medical education and nephrology and
   gaining even greater relevance in the COVID era. However, it presents
   technical challenges and may create an environment of social isolation.
   A `blended learning approach' combines E-learning with traditional
   methods of teaching and offers advantages over either approach alone. We
   have designed and implemented a formalized hemodialysis curriculum at
   our institution that is based on blended learning, utilizing
   faculty-created E-learning tools combined with traditional pedagogical
   methods (bed-side and classroom). The web-based tools discuss
   hemodialysis adequacy, principles of urea transport, hemodialysis access
   examination and access complications. These tools are open access and
   structured around the science of cognitive learning using animation,
   interactivity, self-assessment and immediate feedback features. They
   have been viewed by a wide audience of nephrologists, dialysis nurses as
   well as medicine house-staff and have received strong validation in a
   post-test survey. The online tools have supported a `flipped classroom'
   instructive model and our blended curriculum has been successfully used
   for nephrology fellow training at our institution. Incorporating faculty
   designed/approved E-learning tools to create a `blended' nephrology
   curriculum for trainees at various levels of medical education, can help
   streamline active and time-efficient learning, with the goal of
   improving learner engagement, knowledge acquisition and academic
   curiosity in the field.},

Title = {Sustainable Education through E-Learning: The Case Study of iLearn2.0},
Journal = {SUSTAINABILITY},
Year = {2021},
Volume = {13},
Number = {18},
Month = {SEP},
Abstract = {The present paper studies a blended learning approach provided by a
   university in central Taiwan from 2018 to 2020. In this approach, a
   Moodle E-learning platform called iLearn2.0 was used along with an
   onsite classroom. iLearn 2.0 has four major features, including cloud
   services, mobile learning, flipped classroom, and data analysis. The
   platform was used during 2018-2020 in the Citizen Participation course,
   helping the researcher/teacher to design an interactive course content
   and aiding students to complete classroom activities through their
   devices. In total, 127 students enrolled in citizen participation
   courses were taught during 2018-2020, using different teaching methods.
   In 2018, students studied in a physical classroom. iLearn2.0 was
   integrated with the physical classroom for the 2019 course; lastly, the
   iLearn2.0 platform was used alone in 2020. To evaluate the effect of
   virtual teaching on the students' performance, the researcher used
   summative assessment as the dependent variable. The findings show that
   the class that received the iLearn2.0- assisted teaching had a
   significantly better learning performance than the other two classes.
   However, when researchers used iLearn2.0 alone, both the scores and the
   feedback from students were lower than those in blended and face-to-face
   teaching. The results suggest the effectiveness of iLearn2.0 assistance,
   while learners' performance did not show any significant change in a
   totally online class. Results were assessed in the view of
   sustainability, and three sustainability dimensions were found to be
   improved in the hybrid classroom. The researcher suggests that iLearn2.0
   be integrated with other learning tools for maximum results, as it
   allows students to have a more diverse learning experience, strengthen
   sustainable learning, and grasp the progress of their courses and
   learning activities in a timely manner.},

Title = {``PEM Pals{''}-Cultivating a Learning Community During the Pandemic},

Abstract = {Objectives
   The current pandemic has pushed medical educators to rethink traditional
   learning constructs as residents are experiencing fewer patient contacts
   in the pediatric emergency department (PED). Especially for those bound
   for a career in pediatric emergency medicine (PEM), we designed a
   curriculum to proactively address this emerging learning gap,
   incorporating a wellness ``check-in{''} at the beginning of each
   session. The objective of this report is to share the themes of this
   wellness check-ins with those engaged in pediatric emergency medicine
   education and mentorship. Additionally, we share our curricular approach
   as we plan to continue PEM Pals after the pandemic restrictions are
   lifted. Methods
   ``PEM Pals{''} is a twice-weekly video conference meeting made up of
   pediatric residents with an expressed interest in PEM and those
   residents currently on rotation in the pediatric emergency department.
   Following a flipped classroom model, participants complete a presession
   learning activity and then core PEM topics are covered through
   literature review, case discussions, and telesimulations. Each meeting
   begins with a wellness ``check-in.{''} Themes generated from these
   check-ins were member checked by our core learning contingent. Results
   Nine residents make up our core learning contingent and we have had 11
   ``PEM Pals{''} sessions since March 2020. Three themes emerged from the
   wellness check-ins. The first was each postgraduate year's unique
   concern over professional transitions. The second was a pervasive sense
   of guilt. And the third was a grave concern about their ability to
   support and be supported from their personal communities. Conclusions
   The goal of our curriculum was to supplement an anticipated knowledge
   gap. Through use of a wellness ``check-in,{''} we elicited important
   themes for PEM educational leaders to consider as they mentor pediatric
   residents toward a career in PEM during the pandemic.},

Title = {Technology-enhanced learning: a role for video animation},
Journal = {BRITISH DENTAL JOURNAL},
Year = {2021},

Number = {2},
Pages = {93-96},
Month = {JAN},
Abstract = {The last 20 years has seen a shift in medical education from printed
   analogue formats of knowledge transfer to digital knowledge transfer via
   media platforms and virtual learning environments. Traditional
   university medical teaching was characterised by lectures and printed
   textbooks, which to a degree still have an important role to play in
   knowledge acquisition, but which in isolation do not engage the modern
   learner, who has become reliant on digital platforms and `soundbite'
   learning. Recently, however, traditional methods of teaching and
   learning have been augmented by, and indeed sometimes replaced by, the
   alternative learning methods such as: problem-based learning; a greater
   integration of basic science and clinical considerations; smaller
   teaching groups; the `flipped classroom' concept; and various
   technological tools which promote an interactive learning style. The aim
   of these new teaching methods is to overcome the well-documented
   limitations of traditional lectures and printed material in the transfer
   of knowledge from expert to student, by better engaging the minds of
   more visual learners and encouraging the use of diverse resources for
   lifelong learning. In this commentary paper, we share the concept of
   video animation as an additional educational tool, and one that can help
   to integrate molecular, cellular and clinical processes that underpin
   our understanding of biology and pathology in modern education.
   Importantly, while they can provide focused and attractive formats for
   `soundbite' learning, their aim as a tool within the broader educational
   toolbox is to direct the interested reader towards more traditional
   formats of learning, which permit a deeper dive into a particular field
   or concept. In this manner, carefully constructed video animations can
   serve to provide a broad overview of a particular field or concept and
   to facilitate deeper learning when desired by the student.},

Title = {The Formation of Professional ICT-Competence in Teaching Programming to
   Future Teachers of Informatics and IT-Experts},
Journal = {TOMSK STATE UNIVERSITY JOURNAL},

Abstract = {The research aims to identify conditions for the formation of
   professional ICT-competence when learning programming and to
   experimentally verify their effectiveness. This is especially relevant
   in the context of the changing requirements for IT-experts and computer
   science teachers. The analysis of the current state and problems of
   professional training of IT-experts and computer science teachers is
   based on: (1) scientific works of recognized experts in the field of
   teaching computer sciences and, in particular, programming; (2) current
   orders of the Government of the Russian Federation on the approval of
   the teacher's professional standard and the program ``Digital Economics
   of the Russian Federation{''}; (3) educational programs in relevant
   areas; (4) the authors' personal experience reflected in the relevant
   research articles. In the research, a number of scientific methods were
   used. To identify the conditions for the effective formation of
   professional ICT-competence, a general scientific analysis method was
   applied. To verify the identified factors in specially created and
   controlled conditions, a pedagogical experiment was conducted. The
   research was carried out in several phases. The first phase included a
   general analysis of programming teaching systems and the formation of
   professional ICT-competence in the framework of training future
   informatics teachers and IT-experts in higher education institutions.
   During the second phase, the conditions for the effective formation of
   professional ICT-competence in the context of teaching programming were
   identified. The first condition is the possibility of constructing a
   process of teaching programming on the basis of the problem-semiotic
   approach. The second condition is the use of STEM-technology. The third
   condition is the use of specialized video content in accordance with the
   trends of modern IT-technologies (the flipped classroom concept). At the
   third phase of the research, a qualitative assessment of the
   effectiveness of the selected conditions was made. For this, an approach
   was applied in which the main measurement criterion is the
   characteristic of advancing to higher levels of professional
   ICT-competence, which implies the formation of special competencies
   decomposed into knowledge, abilities, and skills. This approach allowed
   formalizing the assessment process and proving the hypothesis about the
   influence of the selected conditions on the effectiveness of the
   formation of professional ICT-competence using statistical measurement
   (a chi-square test). Thus, the research allows considering the
   application of the problem-semiotic approach, modern IT-technologies,
   and exercises within the framework of STEM-education as effective
   conditions for the formation of professional ICT-competence when
   teaching programming to future computer science teachers and IT-experts.},

   costs and complex design can limit their wide adoption. In 2020, the
   COVID-I9 pandemic forced programs to identify unique ways to still
   provide authentic research experiences while students were virtual. We
   report here a complete guide for the successful implementation of a
   semester-long virtual CURE that uses Drosophila behavioral assays to
   explore the connection between pain and addiction with the use of an
   at-home ``lab-in-a-box.{''} Individual components were piloted across
   three semesters and launched as a 100-level introductory course with 19
   students. We found that this course increased science identity and
   successfully improved key research competencies as per the Undergraduate
   Research Student Self-Assessment (URSSA) survey. This course is ideal
   for flipped classrooms ranging from introductory to upper-level
   biology/neuroscience courses and can be integrated directly into the
   lecture period without the need for building a new course. Given the low
   cost, recent comfort with virtual learning environments, and current
   proliferation of flipped classrooms following the 2020 pandemic, this
   curriculum could serve as an ideal project-based active-learning tool
   for equitably increasing access to authentic research experiences.},

Title = {Effects of gamifying questions on English grammar learning mediated by
   epistemic curiosity and language anxiety},
Journal = {COMPUTER ASSISTED LANGUAGE LEARNING},
Abstract = {Different types of gamification can be advantageous to enhancing
   students' learning. In contrast to the extant gamification literature
   focusing on designing reward systems and/or facilitating teachers'
   gamification of learning contents, this study focuses on the gamifying
   of learning content by students. To verify the efficacy of gamification
   as a learning activity, the effects of students posing and gamifying
   questions in relation to second language grammar learning are explored.
   A gamification platform calledTipOnwas designed to allow students to
   pose and gamify questions according to different game modes to
   facilitate their classmates' practicing English grammar. To examine the
   emotional regulation effects of posing and gamifying questions on
   learning performance, this study explored the effectiveness of gamifying
   content by examining how participants' two types of epistemic curiosity
   (i.e., interest-type epistemic curiosity (IEC) and deprivation-type
   epistemic curiosity (DEC)) related to posing questions affected their
   attitude towards gamification (ATG) and their learning progress. In this
   experiment, participants had to pose English grammar questions related
   to verb tense, and gamify the questions using TipOn. They then played
   games using other students' content. Data were collected from 96
   ninth-grade students, and the correlations between constructs were
   evaluated using the path-analytical technique. The research results
   indicated that, first, English learning anxiety is negatively related to
   the two aforementioned types of epistemic curiosity. Second, IEC had no
   significant impact on ATG; however, DEC was positively associated with
   ATG. Third, ATG could positively predict students' learning progress.
   The results imply that teachers could use this gamifying system in a
   flipped classroom to motivate students to tap into their epistemic
   curiosity to increase their content learning and enhance the effects of
   learning.},

Title = {Towards effective e-learning on sustainability: a case study-course on
   participatory processes in environmental politics},

Abstract = {Purpose
   Distance universities are of great importance for establishing
   sustainability literacy, as they operate as multipliers for thousands of
   students. However, despite several advantages of e-learning environments
   compared to traditional class-teaching, there are still challenges
   regarding suitable e-learning tools and didactical models. The purpose
   of this paper is to evaluate the effectiveness of several e-learning
   tools on students' knowledge and skills growth and to compare two
   learning paths, synchronous vs asynchronous, exploring how each affects
   the level of students' knowledge achievement and skills acquisition.
   Design/methodology/approach
   The empirical analysis is based on an online course ``Participatory
   processes in environmental politics{''}. International MSc and PhD
   students who enrolled in the course were from FernUniversitat in Hagen
   (Germany) and Aberta University (Portugal). The course was designed as
   the flipped classroom, applying different e-learning tools and
   activities, some synchronous and others asynchronous. A pre- and
   post-evaluation questionnaire was applied to evaluate students'
   knowledge and skills. Descriptive statistical analyses were carried out
   on this data.
   Findings
   Results showed that in the synchronous group, knowledge about
   theoretical approaches to citizen participation and sustainable
   environmental governance improved to a greater extent, whereas the
   asynchronous group showed greater improvement in nearly all skills
   related to intercultural communication and e-learning. Also, in the
   synchronous path, students enhanced their knowledge on ``research
   application{''} to a greater extent.
   Originality/value
   Evaluating the effectiveness of different e-learning tools on students'
   sustainability knowledge and information and communication technologies
   skills is a fundamental issue. The study discusses these issues,
   contributing to enhancing the use of adequate and grounded e-learning
   models on sustainable development in higher education.},

Abstract = {There are limited opportunities for undergraduate nursing students to
   take part in hands-on critical care. A course was developed to expose
   students to the critically ill patient in the intensive care unit
   environment and introduce skills that students may not have the
   opportunity to engage in during their clinical hours. Led by two faculty
   currently practicing in critical care, this course used multiple
   learning modalities, including high-fidelity simulation; didactic
   teaching; online discussion; and narrative, reflective writing, to teach
   critical care concepts and entry-level skills.},

Title = {p Radiology Medical Student Education 2020: Surveys of the Alliance of
   Medical Student Educators in Radiology and Medical Students},
Journal = {ACADEMIC RADIOLOGY},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {29},

Month = {FEB},
Abstract = {Rationale and Objectives: The coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19)
   pandemic has resulted in significant changes to medical student
   education by disrupting clinical rotations, licensing exams, and
   residency applications. To evaluate the pandemic's impact and required
   modifications of radiology medical student courses, the authors
   developed and administered surveys to Alliance of Medical Student
   Edu-cators in Radiology (AMSER) faculty and enrolled medical students.
   The surveys requested feedback and insight about respondents'
   experiences and innovations. Materials and Methods: Anonymous
   twenty-question and seventeen-question surveys about the pandemic's
   impact on medical student education were distributed via email to AMSER
   members and medical students. The surveys consisted of multiple choice,
   ranking, Likert scale, and open-ended questions. Differences in the
   Likert score agreement was performed using one-sided
   Wilcoxon-Mann-Whitney tests. Survey data were collected using
   SurveyMonkey (San Mateo, California). This study was IRB exempt.
   Results: The AMSER survey indicated 96\% of institutions cancelled
   medical student courses and 92\% resumed with virtual courses,
   typi-cally general radiology. A total of 64\% of faculty enjoyed online
   teaching, although 82\% preferred on-site courses. A total of 62\% of
   stu-dents felt an online radiology course was an excellent alternative
   to an on-site rotation, although 27\% disagreed. A total of 69\% of
   students who completed both on-site and online courses preferred the
   on-site format. Survey-reported innovations and free response comments
   have been collated as educational resources. Conclusion: Faculty were
   able to adapt radiology courses to the online environment utilizing
   interactive lectures, self-directed learning, flipped classroom
   sessions, and virtual readouts, which were effective for student
   respondents. Hybrid rotations with on-site and online elements may offer
   the best of both worlds.},

Title = {Case-Based Curriculum With Integrated Smartphone Applications Improves
   Internal Medicine Resident Knowledge Of Contraceptive Care},
Journal = {ADVANCES IN MEDICAL EDUCATION AND PRACTICE},
Year = {2019},
Volume = {10},
Pages = {971-977},
Abstract = {Background: Contraception is an essential preventive service for all
   women. However, the literature suggests that internal medicine residents
   have low levels of confidence and knowledge of contraceptive care.
   Objective: We designed and implemented a novel contraception curriculum
   promoting active, collaborative learning. We sought to evaluate whether
   this curriculum improved internal medicine resident knowledge of and
   comfort with contraceptive care through the administration of
   pre-/post-surveys.
   Methods: Our curriculum was delivered in a two-hour session as part of
   the mandatory ambulatory curriculum for internal medicine interns at our
   institution in the academic year 2017-2018. Interns were provided with
   select online resources and two smartphone applications at the beginning
   of the session, which they then used in case-based small group work.
   Small group work was followed by a large group case review,
   co-facilitated by OB/GYN and internal medicine faculty.
   Results: Thirty-eight participants completed surveys assessing knowledge
   of and comfort with contraceptive care immediately before and after the
   curriculum; 20 participants completed surveys assessing the same domains
   4-6 months after the curriculum. Data from surveys administered
   immediately post-curriculum demonstrated significant improvements in
   knowledge about and comfort with counseling about, assessing medical
   eligibility for, and initiating multiple forms of contraception. Many of
   these improvements in knowledge and comfort were maintained on follow-up
   surveys 4-6 months following the curriculum.
   Conclusion: Our case-based curriculum with integrated smartphone
   applications resulted in significant improvements in internal medicine
   resident knowledge of and comfort with the key skills of contraceptive
   care. In contrast to active, collaborative learning methodologies such
   as the flipped classroom, our methodology supports active, collaborative
   learning without requiring advance learner preparation, and is thus well
   suited to the time constraints of the graduate medical education
   setting. Our methodology is readily translatable to other clinical
   topics and residency curricula.},

Abstract = {Nowadays, different technological solutions are already embedded into
   higher education: Web platforms, collaborative cloud environments,
   massive online courses, the flipped classroom, intelligence collective,
   etc. Besides, the current implementation of the European Higher
   Education Area has opened the doors to these new and revolutionary
   techniques and proposes a strategic action plan for 2019 derived from
   digital transformation, through the promotion of a collaborative
   European hackathon. Among these solutions, wikis are proved to match
   perfectly the requirements of the future learning framework 3.0 in which
   the student is the protagonist of his/her own education. Thus, many
   different universities around the world are nowadays supporting
   activities and events about the edition of wikis. In this work, we are
   interested in a special and universal wiki, Wikipedia. This encyclopedia
   is often used for student learning in high schools and university
   classrooms. However, today, there are few educational university
   projects dedicated to the editing of articles, and even fewer to the
   editing of scientific articles. There is no literature, to the knowledge
   of the authors that gathers both. Therefore, this work has a double
   objective, on the one hand, to highlight the international educational
   projects in which this great encyclopedia is edited and improved,
   especially by indicating the theme of the chosen edition, edition dates
   and achievements. On the other hand, once the action framework has been
   introduced, we show the specific educational project, which has been
   working with students from the first courses of the Universidad
   Politecnica de Madrid (UPM) since 2009 and promoted by one of the
   authors. Finally, and to go into more detail, the authors analyze a
   particular educational experience about the Wikipedia edition carried
   out at the UPM in 2017. The results show that editing Wikipedia produces
   a relevant improvement in the five proposed objectives.},

Title = {How to. . . train your skills goes digital! A project report on the
   development and implementation of practice-oriented digital student
   tutorials},
Journal = {GMS JOURNAL FOR MEDICAL EDUCATION},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {39},
Number = {1},
Abstract = {Objective: This project report outlines the development and
   implementation of digital tutorials ({''}How to... train your skills
   goes digital!{''}) by peer tutors (TUTs) based on previously established
   in-person tutorials, as well as the subsequent combination of both
   approaches. The TUTs' objective, in spite of corona-related restrictions
   and strict hygiene requirements during the pandemic, was to provide
   fellow students with the opportunity to learn, practice and reflect on
   clinical-practical skills.
   Methodology: In a collaborative undertaking, the TUTs first analyzed the
   learning objectives of the in-person tutorials in order to be able to
   design content-matched digital tutorials without entirely abandoning the
   practical aspect. The Moodle learning management platform was selected
   as the appropriate tool for delivery of the relevant theoretical
   knowledge. Practical exercises are embedded in the digital tutorials
   during online meetings. The participants (PTs) create their own models
   in the sense of a home skills station based on instructions provided via
   Moodle. Acceptance was systematically documented via questionnaires.
   Results: The digital tutorials were well accepted by the PTs (n=64).
   Evaluation (response rate: 37.5\%) outcomes were consistently positive.
   Both course implementation and the PTs' own progress were rated
   ``good{''} to ``very good{''}. Nevertheless, the PTs do not yet feel
   well-prepared to carry out the various activities practiced
   independently. In the winter semester of 2020/21, the in-person
   tutorials were also reintroduced in a combined format. The marked demand
   for the tutorials may indicate the PT preference for practice on the
   simulation center models.
   Conclusion: The systematic combination of digital and in-person
   tutorials using the flipped classroom approach would appear to make
   sense in the long run. The effectiveness and sustainability of this
   approach in comparison with in-person tutorials only should be further
   investigated.},

Title = {Effectiveness of an interprofessional patient safety team-based learning
   simulation experience on healthcare professional trainees},
Journal = {BMC MEDICAL EDUCATION},
Year = {2018},
Volume = {18},
Month = {AUG 8},
Abstract = {Background: Although the American Council of Graduate Medical Education
   (ACGME) mandates formal education in patient safety, there is a lack of
   standardized educational practice on how to conduct patient safety
   training. Traditionally, patient safety is taught utilizing
   instructional strategies that promote passive learning such as
   self-directed online learning modules or didactic lectures that result
   in suboptimal learning and satisfaction.
   Methods: During the summer of 2015, 76 trainees consisting of internal
   medicine interns and senior-level nursing students participated in an
   interactive patient safety workshop that used a flipped classroom
   approach integrating team based learning (TBL) and interprofessional
   simulated application exercises.
   Results: Workshop trainees demonstrated an increase in knowledge
   specifically related to patient safety core concepts on the Team
   Readiness Assurance Test (TRAT) compared to the Individual Readiness
   Assurance Test (IRAT) (p = 0.001). Completion rates on the simulation
   application exercises checklists were high except for a few critical
   action items such as hand-washing, identifying barriers to care, and
   making efforts to clarify code status with patient. The Readiness for
   Interprofessional Learning Scale (RIPLS) subscale scores for Teamwork
   and Collaboration and Professional Identity were higher on the
   post-workshop survey compared to the pre-workshop survey, however only
   the difference in the Positive Professional Identity subscale was
   statistically significant (p = 0.03). A majority (90\%) of the trainees
   either agreed that the safety concepts they learned would likely improve
   the quality of care they provide to future patients.
   Conclusions: This novel approach to safety training expanded teaching
   outside of the classroom and integrated simulation and engagement in
   error reduction strategies. Next steps include direct observation of
   trainees in the clinical setting for team-based competency when it comes
   to patient safety and recognition of system errors.},

Title = {Students Teaching Students: Student-Led Ultrasound Curriculum in Medical
   School Education},

Abstract = {Introduction
   With the expanding use of point-of-care ultrasound throughout medical
   specialties for the rapid bedside assessment integral to patient care,
   medical schools have sought to incorporate ultrasound education into
   their curriculum. Second-year medical students (MS2s) at our institution
   met this demand by forming the Ultrasound Student Instructor Cadre
   (USSIC), a longitudinal ultrasound curriculum where MS2s teach first
   year medical students (MS1s). The objectives of this study were to
   assess the ultrasound knowledge of medical students and their
   perceptions of ultrasound incorporation into their medical education.
   Methods
   Our flipped classroom curriculum consisted of four lessons
   (cardiopulmonary, gastrointestinal, genitourinary, and musculoskeletal)
   composed of videos, didactic lessons, and hands-on probe-time, with
   15-minute pre-and post-assessments. Paired Wilcoxon signed-rank tests
   were performed to evaluate the differences in the pre-and
   post-assessment scores for each teaching session. Additionally, an
   end-of-the year survey assessed the perceived preparedness and overall
   satisfaction of the MS1s with the course.
   Results
   The differences between the pre-and post-assessments for each teaching
   session were statistically significant: cardiopulmonary (45.6 +/- 16.9\%
   vs. 82.9 +/- 9.4\%, p < 0.0001, n = 55), gastrointestinal (53.9 +/-
   18.0\% vs. 84.1 +/- 13.5\%, p < 0.0001, n = 54), genitourinary (68.9 +/-
   19.1\% vs. 91.4 +/- 14.4\%, p < 0.0001, n = 64), and musculoskeletal
   (33.6 +/- 14.7\% vs. 78.2 +/- 18.2\%, p < 0.0001, n = 55).
   Conclusion
   Our study suggests that MS1s met the learning objective for each
   teaching session. Furthermore, MS1s who became USSIC instructors as MS2s
   felt more prepared and were more satisfied with the course. This study
   demonstrates the efficacy of student-led instruction in ultrasound, and
   we offer our model for adoption into other medical schools.},

Title = {Investigating Students' Experiences and Perceptions of a Flipped and
   Adaptive Online Engineering Thermodynamics Class},
Journal = {INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF ENGINEERING EDUCATION},

Pages = {362-375},
Abstract = {The trend of incorporating flipped learning to create active and
   effective learning environments has become increasingly popular in
   higher education in recent years. Existing research in Science
   Technology Engineering and Mathematics (STEM) suggests that students
   have a positive attitude towards flipped learning. This positive
   attitude strongly correlates to the perceptions of enhanced motivation,
   effective learning, and engagement. However, most of the studies on
   flipped learning in higher education only yield quantitative results.
   Students' perceptions of their experiences of online learning, in
   particular of their motivation in flexible and effective learning
   environments are rarely investigated qualitatively to provide in-depth
   reasoning. Recent online pedagogy has integrated adaptive learning tools
   to meet individual learning needs. This study focused on both flipped
   and adaptive learning strategies implemented in an online thermodynamics
   class. The flipped classroom freed up lecture time for interactive and
   effective online learning activities. This study aimed to interview,
   analyze, and explore underlying themes of college students' perceptions
   and experiences in an online Thermodynamics class using flipped and
   adaptive learning. A total of 14 out of 54 students volunteered for a
   semi-structured interview. Students from the Students Assessing Teaching
   and Learning program were trained to conduct the individual interviews
   and transcribe the recording for analysis. Three researchers analyzed
   the data using thematic analysis. The results indicate that flipped
   learning enhances the students' learning experience and perceptions of
   learning effectiveness, ownership, and motivation. Nevertheless,
   applying adaptive learning with predesigned learning algorithms can
   cause student frustration. Through examination of the three
   psychological needs of the self-determination theory, adaptive learning
   can be perceived as a positive experience if a student's extrinsic
   motives align well with his needs and values. The qualitative findings
   of this study not only demonstrate the effectiveness of modern learning
   technologies in an engineering course, but also provide a foundation for
   future pedagogical design.},

Title = {The Attractiveness of Reversing Teaching Forms Feedback on an Electrical

Abstract = {The transformation of teaching practices in universities remains
   necessary to better motivate, involve and promote the success of
   increasingly ``connected{''} students. These new practices can be
   off-putting to teachers because of the complexity of their
   implementation. New practices, such as those in the inverted/flipped
   classroom model, which consists of reversing the nature of in-classroom
   and out-of-class activities, are well documented in the pedagogical
   literature; however, few empirical studies are available that allow us
   to objectively analyze their effect on student learning. As such,
   university teachers are not being encouraged to change their traditional
   pedagogical practices. This manuscript proposes a rather simple method,
   which draws on but is not directly equivalent to the inverted classroom
   model. The aim here is to reverse the traditional pedagogical sequence
   of ``Lectures; Tutorials; then Practical work{''}. This mode of teaching
   is still very popular in the university system, particularly in France.
   More precisely, in the proposed model, teaching begins with practical
   work, followed by tutorials and finishing with lectures that offer time
   for questions and debates. This method places much more importance on
   collaborative working and the consolidation of students' knowledge and
   skills. An online course platform called Celene has been widely used to
   support student learning and to maximize teacher-learner interactions.
   The proposed approach was tested with students of an electrical
   engineering course in their final year of engineering school. A full
   six-year feedback period is discussed to demonstrate the interactivity
   and effectiveness of the approach. The results of the various
   experiments carried out show that this method ``smooths{''} out some of
   the difference in student competence. In particular, it is a powerful
   remediation approach to restore energy to students, who sometimes feel
   overwhelmed by the traditional approach, which is very transmissive. As
   a result, the proposed method significantly reduces failure rates.},

Abstract = {In science courses in general, but especially in first year chemistry
   classes, the amount of content that is delivered is often overwhelming
   and too complex for the student to easily cope with. Students not only
   have to gain knowledge in a variety of different field, they also have
   to learn new laboratory skills and analytical techniques. Additionally,
   there is an issue with more and more information being available to
   everybody through the internet, while our education often still focusses
   on delivering that knowledge, rather than exploring ways how students
   can be guided to understanding and using the knowledge provided. There
   have been different approaches on how to make `dry' scientific concepts
   more interesting and how enhance student engagement, ranging from
   problem-based learning approaches, case studies or flipped classroom
   models. We have recently turned a fairly classic first year chemistry
   course on its head. In the new structure, students are gaining knowledge
   and understanding purely through the completion of a range of
   challenges. We have removed all lectures, tutorials and the final exam,
   and all interaction with the student happens in the laboratory.
   Throughout the semester, students attempt to complete a range of
   challenges, both theoretical and practical, find relevant information,
   propose approaches to solving the challenges, and discuss these and
   subsequent outcomes with academic staff. In order to analyse the design,
   we have conducted structured interviews with students from 2016-2018.
   Initial assessment of the data suggests a high level of engagement of
   the students, paired with a better preparation of students for their
   subsequent studies. Students enjoyed having the freedom to choose and
   design their own experiments. Additionally, students improved
   significantly in non-content related aspects such as time-management,
   organisation, planning and self-learning, with notable impact on their
   learning in higher years.},

Title = {Anatomy education in US Medical Schools: before, during, and beyond
   COVID-19},
Journal = {BMC MEDICAL EDUCATION},

Abstract = {Background Anatomy education in US medical schools has seen numerous
   changes since the call for medical education reform in 2010. The purpose
   of this study was to survey US medical schools to assess recent trends
   in anatomy education, the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on anatomy
   teaching, and future directions of medical school anatomy curricula.
   Methods We sent a 29-item survey to anatomy course directors of 145
   AAMC-associated allopathic medical schools inquiring about their
   schools' anatomy curricula. The survey contained objective discrete
   questions concerning the curricula changes preceding COVID-19 and those
   directly related to COVID-19. We also asked subjective and open-ended
   questions about the impact of COVID-19 and future directions of anatomy
   education. Results A total of 117/143 course directors (82\%) completed
   the survey. Most schools (60\%) reported a major change to their anatomy
   course within the past five years, including a decrease in total course
   time (20\%), integration of anatomy into other courses (19\%), and
   implementation of a ``flipped classroom{''} (15\%) teaching style. Due
   to COVID-19, there was a decrease in the fraction of course time
   dedicated to ``hands-on{''} learning (p < 0.01) and teaching of clinical
   correlates (p = 0.02) and radiology (p < 0.01). Most course directors
   (79\%) reported that COVID-19 had a negative impact on quality of
   learning due to decreased interactive or in-person (62\%) learning and
   lack of dissection (44\%). Incorporation of virtual-reality applications
   or 3D anatomy software (23\%) and a decrease in cadaver dissection
   (13\%) were the most common future anticipated changes. Conclusion The
   constraints conferred by COVID-19 highlight the importance of maximizing
   interactive learning in the discipline of anatomy. In an era of social
   distancing and decreased emphasis on conventional anatomy dissection,
   adaptations of new technologies and teaching modalities may allow for
   traditional educational rigor to be sustained.},

Title = {Online Module Builds Skills for Internal Medicine Interns in Responding
   to Emotions During Complex Serious Illness Conversations},

Abstract = {Context. Responding to emotion cues is an essential skill for
   communicating with patients and families, but many health care trainees
   have difficulty applying this skill within the context of a complex
   conversation.
   Objectives. We created an original online module to facilitate
   deliberate practice of a three-skill framework for responding to emotion
   cues during complex or nonlinear serious illness conversations.
   Methods. Our original online module uses a gamebook format, which
   prompts trainees to engage in focused and repetitive practice of three
   well-defined skills for responding to emotion cues in a simulated family
   conference. We implemented the module as a part of a communication
   skills curriculum for interns rotating in the intensive care unit. After
   completing the module, all interns answered an open-ended survey
   question about their perceived skill acquisition. Results were analyzed
   by a qualitative method and coded into themes.
   Results. About 71\% of interns (n = 65 of 92) completed the online
   module and open-ended survey question. About 89\% of participants
   responded that they would use a naming, understanding, respecting,
   supporting, or exploring statement in response to an emotion cue. Nearly
   two-thirds of participants articulated their rationale for using naming,
   understanding, respecting, supporting, or exploring statements (e.g.,
   preparing patients to process complex medical information, eliciting
   information about patient perspective.)
   Conclusion. Our online emotion cue module is a novel tool for deliberate
   practice of advanced skills for responding to emotion cues in serious
   illness conversations. In future studies, we will investigate whether
   our module's efficacy is enhanced by using it as a part of a flipped
   classroom curriculum with an in-person simulation session. (C) 2020

Month = {SEP},
Abstract = {I nterventional pulmonology (IP) is experiencing a rapid evolution of
   new technologies. There is a need to develop structured training
   programs, organized in high volume expert centers in order to improve
   trainee education, and including the development of validated metrics
   for their competency assessment. Concerning teaching methods, a gradual
   progression from theory to practice, using new teaching techniques,
   including live sessions and low and high-fidelity simulation, flipped
   classroom models and problem-based learning (PBL) exercises would
   provide a training setting more suitable for our current need to improve
   skills and update professionals. Training programs should be
   learner-centered and competence-oriented, as well as being based on a
   spiral-shaped approach in which the same subject is addressed many
   times, from new and different perspectives of knowledge, ability,
   behavior and attitude, until the trainee has demonstrated a high degree
   of skill and professionalism. Furthermore there is a need to standardize
   the training programs as guide for physicians wishing to undertake a
   gradual and voluntary improvement of their own competencies, and assist
   those planning and organizing training programs in IP. The article
   includes a general part on core curriculum contents, innovative training
   methods and simulation, and introduces the following articles on the
   skills that the Interventional Pulmonologist must master in order to
   perform the different procedures. This monography should be considered a
   starting point that will evolve over time and results in better training
   for practitioners and better care for our patients. The task of
   establishing a trainee's competence to practice independently as an
   Interventional Pulmonologist remains the responsibility of the IP
   fellowship program director and faculty, who validate logbooks and
   assess competence for each procedure. These standards need to be
   reviewed and approved by national and International Scientific Societies
   and Healthcare Institutions with the aim to improve, disseminate and
   incorporate them in healthcare programs.},

Title = {Fostering the use of online learning resources: results of using a
   mobile collaboration tool based on gamification in a blended course},
Journal = {INTERACTIVE LEARNING ENVIRONMENTS},
Abstract = {Over the past years, higher education institutions have been exploring
   different mechanisms to adapt their learning and teaching practices to
   increase students' engagement. One of the proposals has been to reuse
   Massive Online Open Courses (MOOCs) as Small Online Private Courses
   (SPOCs), or as complementary resources in traditional courses through
   blended learning practices, such as flipped classroom. However, the
   integration of online courses as a complement to face-to-face courses
   poses some challenges. First, students are not used to such blended
   learning approaches and it is generally difficult for teachers to
   motivate them to access online resources for the preparation of
   face-to-face sessions. Second, students are not used to the dynamics of
   blended learning scenarios, which are less teacher-centered and require
   their active participation. We propose the use of the mobile application
   MyMOOCSpace (MMS) to meet these challenges and increase students'
   motivation and use of learning resources in blended learning courses
   that use SPOCs as a complement. MMS is a mobile learning application
   based on gamification mechanisms to promote collaboration and motivation
   of students in the use of digital resources as a complement to blended
   learning courses. In this paper, we present the results of a
   quasi-experiment in a blended course with 294 students that uses a SPOC
   as a complement, with the aim to assess the effect of MMS on students'
   motivation and learning resources consumption. In particular, the
   behavior of two groups of students with the main digital resources of
   the SPOC (videos and formative assessments) was analyzed: one using the
   MMS (GTest group), and the other not using MMS (GTrad group). The
   results suggest that the use of MMS had a positive correlation with the
   videos consumption, besides increasing student' interaction with
   assessment exercises in the SPOC.},

Abstract = {ObjectiveDespite procedural skills being recognized as an important
   component of medical school education, medical students are not
   confident in their ability to carry out a range of medical procedures.
   We conducted an institutional needs assessment and used the results to
   inform the creation of a procedure-based preclinical elective for first-
   and second-year students.
   MethodsWe surveyed second-, third-, and fourth-year medical students at
   Alpert Medical School as well as select program directors to guide
   selection of a list of procedures to be taught in the elective. We then
   created an extracurricular 10-week procedural skills course for
   preclerkship medical students utilizing a hands-on, flipped classroom
   practice model. Volunteer preceptors were recruited from the Department
   of Emergency Medicine to participate with a student-to-faculty ratio not
   exceeding 5:1. Knowledge and skill acquisition were assessed using a
   multiple-choice knowledge exam and 4-station practical exam,
   respectively. Pre- and post-course online surveys were used to assess
   self-perceived confidence for all procedures.
   ResultsWe implemented our procedural skills training course for first-
   and second-year medical students in the fall of 2015. Forty-four
   students applied for the first iteration of the course and 15 students
   were selected to participate. Fourteen students ultimately completed the
   elective as well as the subsequent course surveys, multiple-choice exam,
   and practical exam. Students who participated in the elective had
   increased levels of self-reported confidence at the conclusion of the
   elective and performed better on a practical exam and multiple-choice
   exam compared to students who participated in only the standard
   curriculum.
   ConclusionA longitudinal preclerkship procedural course early during
   medical school is a feasible method of teaching procedural skills to a
   cohort of learners. A number of adjustments could be made to the course
   in order to scale up and include a larger cohort of students at our own
   or another institution.},

Title = {Gamified experimental physics classes: a promising active learning
   methodology for higher education},
Journal = {EUROPEAN JOURNAL OF PHYSICS},
Year = {2019},
Volume = {40},
Number = {4},
Month = {JUL},
Abstract = {Gamification is defined as the use of game design elements in a non-game
   context. In higher education, gamification is a methodology intending to
   motivate students to acquire academical knowledge and soft skills, while
   keeping them engaged and pleased with the learning process. This study
   reports the application of a gamified class concerning electric
   resistors, the first of a 12-topic discipline offered to 2nd-year
   students in physics and engineering. Adopting a Flipped Classroom
   methodology and a narrative based on household power consumption,
   traditional contents about resistors and electricity were taught. Also,
   instructions about how to use an ohm-meter and how to configure an
   electronic spreadsheet to do basic statistics were given. In order to
   customize and enrich the class, some optional contents (usually in a
   video) were made available. The access to the experimental activities
   was constrained by approval in four graded quizzes. Every activity was
   acknowledged by virtual coins to be converted in benefits (extra time to
   run final examinations, permission to consult class appointments and the
   opportunity to re-discuss a mistake in the final examination) and
   points, to rank students (leaderboard). Forty-five students attended the
   gamified class. No control group was implemented because this study
   aimed to find a good design for a gamified class, not to compare
   traditional to active methodologies. The overall student acceptance was
   excellent, and they reported that gamification can be a more engaging
   methodology than traditional classes, further developing soft skills and
   academic knowledge. However, the time spent to run the gamified class
   must be arranged, reducing the time inside the classroom. The
   opportunity to perform the experiment was considered essential, and
   could not be substituted by videos or texts since new doubts and
   concerns are pointed out during the practice when the teacher is
   present. Gamification can be a methodology capable of engaging and being
   enjoyable students, giving them more than just information but also soft
   skills.},

Title = {The virtues of the virtual medical school interview},
Journal = {MEDICAL EDUCATION ONLINE},
Year = {2021},
Volume = {26},
Number = {1},
Month = {JAN 1},
Abstract = {The COVID-19 pandemic has mandated the use of virtual interactions in
   medical school. Although this falls mainly in the area of didactic
   instruction, of necessity, it has extended to the critical Admissions
   Process and the Medical School Interview itself. The California
   University of Science and Medicine (CUSM) with their flipped classroom
   approach had previously entered a virtual space of instruction even
   before COVID-19. Because CUSM was, in a sense, already committed to
   `virtual' education, in the face of the COVID-19 pandemic, CUSM focused
   not on what it might lose but what it might gain and what their
   applicants to medical school might gain with the virtual format. The
   COVID-19 pandemic provided a unique opportunity to initially compare the
   Virtual Interview with the traditional On-Campus (In-Person) Interview
   during the hybrid 2020 year when the COVID-19 pandemic began. The
   Virtual Interview was patterned after the On-Campus Interview with some
   modifications. The same faculty conducted both interviews. A number of
   inherent advantages of the Virtual Interview surfaced to these faculty
   interviewers based on their subjective observations and conclusions. The
   overall interviewee satisfaction with the Virtual Interview was very
   positive based on their subjective observations and conclusions. The
   objective data from the Virtual Interviews compared to the On-Campus
   Interviews in the hybrid year resulted in a greater percentage of both
   offers of acceptance (p = .001) and matriculations (p = .001). In order
   to strengthen our initial observations, we expanded our study to include
   2 pre-COVID-19 years (2018, 2019) of exclusively On-Campus interviews (n
   = 743) and 1 additional COVID-19 year (2021) of exclusively Virtual
   Interviews (n = 529). In this expanded study, interviewee demographics
   were not confounding and the Virtual Interview gave rise to overall
   greater interviewee satisfaction (p = .001), a trend to greater
   interviewer satisfaction and a greater percentage of both offers of
   acceptance (p = .047) and matriculations (p = .036).},

Title = {Teaching anatomy using an active and engaging learning strategy},
Journal = {BMC MEDICAL EDUCATION},
Year = {2019},
Volume = {19},
Month = {MAY 16},
Abstract = {BackgroundVarious evidence-based and student-centered strategies such as
   team-based learning (TBL), case-based learning (CBL), and flipped
   classroom have been recently applied to anatomy education and have shown
   to improve student engagement and interaction. These strategies shift
   the focus of teaching from knowledge transmission to knowledge
   construction by students and encourage the use of tasks. This study
   discusses the use of an active and engaging learning strategy to teach
   the musculoskeletal system to Year 1 MBBS students (Faculty of Medical
   Sciences, The University of the West Indies, Cave Hill, Barbados) and
   examines the correlation between assessment modalities and student
   performance.MethodsThe Active and Engaging Learning Strategy was used to
   assess student learning in the form of oral presentations. Students had
   presentations on muscle attachments, muscle actions, blood and nerve
   supply, and applied anatomy of the limb musculature. Questions on the
   limbs (Locomotor System) were included in pre and post-presentation
   spotters, in-course assessments, and final examinations. Percentages,
   paired t-test, independent sample t-test, and zero-order correlations
   were performed to confirm the results for the different objectives of
   the study.ResultsThe main modes of presentation chosen were poems
   (37.1\%), followed by stories (21.2\%), songs (11.4\%), and skits
   (10.6\%). The majority of students (84\%) found the strategies
   beneficial and recommended such sessions for future cohorts (92\%).
   Students achieved significantly better scores in post-presentation
   spotters (p<0.01) and the marks of in-course and final examinations also
   showed significant improvement (p<0.01).ConclusionOur study highlighted
   that the active and engaging learning strategy can be used as an
   effective learning tool in anatomy. Students were proactive in preparing
   the muscle presentations by utilizing their own creativity, curiosity,
   and intelligence. Further studies should be conducted using randomized
   controlled trials to assess the effectiveness of various learning
   strategies which could open a new door to medical education.},

Title = {Deep Learning-Based Teaching Strategies of Ideological and Political
   Courses Under the Background of Educational Psychology},
Journal = {FRONTIERS IN PSYCHOLOGY},
Year = {2021},

Abstract = {At present, low teaching efficiency has been the common problem of
   ideological and political education in colleges and universities in
   China. It is essential to improve the teaching efficiency and realize
   the intelligent information transformation of the ideological and
   political courses in colleges and universities. First, the relationship
   between ideological and political courses and the educational psychology
   of college students was analyzed based on the theoretical
   characteristics of educational psychology and college ideological and
   political courses. Additionally, the teaching efficiency of ideological
   and political courses based on deep learning (DL) was analyzed through a
   literature survey. Combined with online teaching modes such as the
   flipped classroom and Massive Open Online Courses, a comprehensive
   online teaching mode of college ideological and political courses was
   proposed via educational psychology and the Single Shot MutiBox Detector
   networks of DL. Then, a total of 100 research subjects were selected
   randomly from the freshmen and sophomores of the Southwest University of
   Science and Technology, and their acceptability to the online
   ideological and political courses was analyzed by a questionnaire
   survey. The results show that the adopted questionnaire had high
   reliability and validity, and the proportion of respondents of different
   genders, grades, and majors was essentially balanced. More than half of
   the students had a good understanding of the comprehensive ideological
   and political courses and made progress in their values, ideology,
   morals, and knowledge reserves. More than half of the students had a
   positive attitude to the course, and they thought that the class
   atmosphere of the course was active, which was conducive to a
   satisfactory learning effect. This indicates that the teaching strategy
   of ideological and political courses in colleges and universities that
   integrates educational psychology, DL, and online information can
   attract students. The contribution of this study is that the research
   outcome can be applied to the concrete formulation of the teaching
   strategies of ideological and political courses for college
   students.</p>},

Title = {Development of disaster nursing education and training programs in the
   past 20 years (2000-2019): A systematic review},
Journal = {NURSE EDUCATION TODAY},
Year = {2021},
Volume = {99},
Month = {APR},
Abstract = {Background: Nurses play a pivotal role in disaster management across the
   globe. With the call for all nurses to be prepared for disasters,
   disaster nursing education and training programs have expanded globally.
   However, a clear picture of the development and coverage of disaster
   nursing education and training programs is lacking. Objectives: This
   study aimed to establish an overall picture of the development of
   disaster nursing education and training programs in the last 20 years,
   outline the contents included, approaches adopted and outcomes reported.
   Methods: A systematic search for relevant literature published between
   January 2000 to December 2019 was conducted using electronic databases
   including the CINAHL, MEDLINE, PubMed, Web of Science, and Scopus with
   the keywords on disaster nursing education and training.
   Findings.
   A total of 75 eligible studies were identified from 3395 potentially
   relevant articles. The numbers of disaster nursing education and
   training programs increased gradually over the past 20 years. They were
   offered in various countries with an unbalanced geographical
   distribution. Most of the existing programs focused on disaster
   preparedness and response, especially on the skills of triage during
   disaster response, instead of addressing the full spectrum of disaster
   management that included mitigation, preparedness, response, and
   recovery phases. Multiple approaches and technologies were adopted,
   including competency-based, all-hazard, inter-professional, flipped
   classroom, simulation, tabletop exercises, and virtual reality ones.
   Nearly half of the included programs adopted a pre- and post-test
   evaluation to examine the outcomes of learning and all of the programs
   reported significant increases in nursing professionals? knowledge and
   skills of related content on disaster management covered in the training
   programs.
   Conclusions: This review provides nurse leaders, educators and
   researchers in nursing with an understanding of the state-of-art of the
   existing disaster nursing education and training programs. More disaster
   nursing research are necessary to enhance the knowledge, skills and
   readiness of the nursing professionals for disaster management in
   meeting global disaster challenges.},

Title = {VIDEOS IN LEARNING MATHEMATICS OF 5 - 6 FORMS STUDENTS},
Journal = {INFORMATION TECHNOLOGIES AND LEARNING TOOLS},
Year = {2021},
Volume = {85},
Number = {5},
Pages = {14-28},
Abstract = {The use of information and communication technologies has become a
   necessary part of the educational process and has led to changes in the
   methodology of teaching mathematics. The problem of creation and use of
   video lectures in the educational process is especially relevant in the
   conditions of active use of blended and distance learning. The national
   and foreign source base of the problem is explored in the article. The
   content of the concepts of video lectures (specially created video based
   on a pre-developed pedagogical script) and video of a logically
   completed piece of educational material interrupted by questions related
   to the revised piece are explained in the article. Creating of video
   lectures that are part of the Global Innovation Online School's
   educational platform are described. It has been shown that video
   lectures can be used in lessons and extracurricular event. In a math
   lesson, video lectures can be used at different stages of the lesson for
   different purposes: at the beginning of the lesson - in order to update
   the basic knowledge; when explaining new material - to provide interest
   and motivation to learn the topic; at the end of the lesson - to
   consolidate the material learned, develop skills and gain experience.
   Besides, video lectures can be used to replicate the learned material or
   to organize blended learning (for example, an `flipped classroom') after
   lessons. Survey results of over 500 students of 5-6 forms are presented,
   as well as their attitudes toward using video lectures in the process of
   mathematics teaching are clarified. It is found that the vast majority
   of students enjoy watching mathematics teaching videos and learning in
   this way. The introduction of video lectures diversifies the process of
   teaching mathematics. In addition, everyone works at a convenient pace,
   in a convenient mode, in a convenient place and at a convenient time.
   Further exploration of technical, methodological, content, aesthetic and
   other components of video lectures, is promising in the future.},

Title = {Curriculum Development with the Implementation of an Open-Source
   Learning Management System for Training Early Clinical Students: An
   Educational Design Research Study},
Journal = {ADVANCES IN MEDICAL EDUCATION AND PRACTICE},
Year = {2021},
Volume = {12},
Pages = {53-61},
Abstract = {Background: Learning management systems (LMSs) have not been explored
   from an educational design research (EDR) perspective for developing
   clinical curricula and supporting novice clinical students with
   self-regulated learning during their early clinical rotations.
   Methods: An EDR approach was used to inform a de novo implementation of
   an LMS during an early clinical rotation of medical students. The EDR
   consisted of three phases: analysis and exploration; design and
   construction; and evaluation and reflection. Process and evaluation data
   (including academic years 2018 and 2019) from two student cohorts (total
   n = 190, 107 without and 83 with LMS exposure) at one academic teaching
   hospital were analyzed.
   Results: Learning theories and concepts of self-regulated learning were
   used to develop and implement an LMS clerkship prototype. For design and
   construction, the maturing prototype design included flipped-classroom
   elements, in-class activation, voluntary digital self-assessments, and
   clinical teaching videos. For evaluation and reflection, global
   satisfaction improvement was significant (from 3.9 to 4.4 on a 5-point
   Likert scale, p < 0.05). There was a positive evaluation trend for all
   evaluation items related to learning climate, self-regulated learning,
   and perceived usefulness of the LMS prototype; however, these changes
   were not statistically significant. The teaching hospital also improved
   its ranking after the introduction of the LMS prototype. Nearly all
   students (94\%) used the LMS material. The average number of times the
   LMS course was accessed per student was 70 (range: 7-172), and the
   average duration students spent online was 58 minutes (range: 9-165).
   Conclusion: Our data indicate that using an EDR approach was helpful for
   systematically introducing an LMS in a clerkship curriculum informed by
   learning theory. Our evidence-oriented curriculum reform was associated
   with higher student satisfaction and appeared to support self-regulated
   learning in the workplace. Further research should explore which
   elements of an LMS most effectively help to achieve educational
   outcomes.},

Abstract = {Background While the Association of American Medical Colleges encourages
   medical schools to incorporate quality improvement and patient safety
   (QI/PS) into their curriculum, medical students continue to have limited
   QI/PS exposure. To prepare medical students for careers that involve
   QI/PS, the Institute for Healthcare Improvement chapter at an allopathic
   medical school and school of allied health professions initiated
   self-directed learning by offering student-led workshops to equip
   learners with skills to improve the quality and safety of healthcare
   processes. Methods In this prospective cohort study, workshops were
   hosted for medical students between 2015 and 2018 on five QI/PS topics:
   Process Mapping, Root-Cause Analysis (RCA), Plan-Do-Study-Act (PDSA)
   Cycles, Evidence Based Medicine (EBM), and Patient Handoffs. Each
   workshop included a hands-on component to engage learners in practical
   applications of QI/PS skills in their careers. Change in knowledge,
   attitudes, and behaviors was assessed via pre- and post-surveys using
   5-point Likert scales, and analyzed using either the McNemar test or
   non-parametric Wilcoxon signed-rank test. Surveys also gathered
   qualitative feedback regarding strengths, future areas for improvement,
   and reasons for attending the workshops. Results Data was collected from
   88.5\% of learners (n = 185/209); 19.5\% of learners reported prior
   formal instruction in these topics. Statistically significant
   improvements in learners' confidence were observed for each workshop.
   Additionally, after attending workshops, learners felt comfortable
   teaching the learned QI/PS skill to colleagues (mean pre/post difference
   1.96, p < 0.0001, n = 139) and were more likely to pursue QI/PS projects
   in their careers (mean pre/post difference 0.45, p < 0.0001, n = 139).
   Lastly, learners demonstrated a statistically significant increase in
   knowledge in four out of five skills workshop topics. Conclusion Few
   medical students have formal instruction in QI/PS tools. This pilot
   study highlights advantages of incorporating an innovative,
   student-directed modified `flipped classroom' methodology, with a focus
   on active experiential learning and minimal didactic instruction.},

Title = {Multimodular Ultrasound Orientation: Residents' Confidence and Skill in
   Performing Point-of-care Ultrasound},
Journal = {CUREUS},

Abstract = {Introduction
   The objectives of this study were to determine if a multimodular
   introductory ultrasound course improved emergency medicine intern
   confidence in performing a point-of-care ultrasound and if our
   educational objectives could he met with our chosen structure.
   Methods
   This is a prospective, observational study evaluating three consecutive
   incoming emergency medicine residency classes from three residency
   programs. A one-day introductory ultrasound course was delivered. The
   course consisted of 1) flipped classroom didactics, 2) in-person,
   casebased interactive teaching sessions, and 3) check-listed,
   goal-driven, hands-on instruction.
   Results
   Over three years, 73 residents participated in this study. There was no
   significant difference in performance on the written test (p = 0.54) or
   the skills assessment (p = 0.16) between years. Performance on the
   written pre-test was not a predictor of performance on the skills test
   (R-2 = 0.028; p = 0.19). Prior to training, residents were most
   confident in performing a focused assessment with sonography for trauma
   examination (median confidence 5.5 (interquartile range (IQR): 3 - 7) on
   a 10-point Likert scale where 1 represents low confidence and 10
   represents high confidence). They reported the lowest confidence in
   performing a cardiac ultrasound (3 (IQR: 2 - 6)). Following training,
   residents reported increased confidence with all applications (p <
   0.001). Eighty-five percent (confidence interval (CI): 73, 92) of
   residents agreed that the online ultrasound lectures effectively teach
   point-of-care ultrasound applications and 98\% (CI: 88, 100) agreed that
   case-based interactive sessions helped them understand how ultrasound
   changes the management of acutely ill patients.
   Conclusions
   A written test of knowledge regarding the use of point-of-care
   ultrasound does not correlate with procedural skills at the start of
   residency, suggesting that teaching and evaluation of both types of
   skills are necessary. Following a multimodular introductory ultrasound
   course, residents showed increased confidence in performing the seven
   basic ultrasound applications. Residents reported that an asynchronous
   curriculum and case-based interactive sessions met the learning
   objectives and effectively taught point-of-care ultrasound applications.},

Title = {BLENDED LEARNING MODELS IN THE TRAINING OF LANGUAGE STUDENTS},
Journal = {PHILOLOGICAL CLASS},
Year = {2021},
Volume = {26},

Pages = {222-230},
Abstract = {The article is devoted to the problems of blended learning at a higher
   educational institution. The material of the article is a brief review
   of German-language methodological literature on this issue, as well as
   the results of a survey of university language students. The relevance
   of the research is determined by the current level of development of
   electronic technologies in conjunction with the desire of the education
   system to innovative processes, which dictates the need to transform the
   learning process in educational institutions of higher education and
   optimize the management of time in independent training of students. The
   aim of the study was to determine the theoretical and methodological
   foundations of blended learning in higher education based on the
   analysis of German- language methodological literature. The basic
   concepts of blended learning theory were clarified and blended learning
   models and scenarios for foreign language learning were described such
   as Flipped Classroom, Flex model, A La Carte model, Rotation Stations.
   A questionnaire survey was conducted to find out the attitude of the
   students of the Institute of Foreign Languages of Ural State Pedagogical
   University towards blended learning, and to assess the readiness of
   language students to e-learning and blended learning.
   Based on the analysis of the methodological literature and the results
   of the questionnaire, the features of the implementation of blended
   learning models in relation to foreign language teaching were
   considered. Four possible scenarios for the integration of blended
   learning models in the training process of language students were
   presented. The scenarios are based on the following principles of
   blended learning: the principle of differentiated learning, the
   principle of personalization, the principle of interactivity and the
   principle of learner independence. The study confirmed the conclusion
   about the need to improve the effectiveness of the use of electronic
   educational resources in the context of informatization of higher
   education.

Abstract = {Purpose - In this work, a reflexive experiential learning process is
   collected, which relates concepts the strategic management and learning
   the game of chess in a flipped classroom and blending learning process
   for the 2017/18 and 2018/19 courses.
   Research methodology - The method followed has been the initial approach
   of the learning curves and the time series of the analysis of learning
   patterns in the game of chess. Also, for the study of the relationship
   between the game of chess and its analogy with strategic management, we
   used a questionnaire, and we apply cluster and network analysis.
   Findings - The main results reveal the existence of different learning
   patterns (linear, quadratic, random walk), associated with the various
   skills of the students. Likewise, different learning groups have been
   identified concerning the times and learning levels by activities. The
   underlying idea is the motivation that the game of chess exerts on
   students to foster greater understanding.
   Research limitations - The limitations are related to the size of the
   classroom and the different initial levels of chess knowledge, which
   have been a real challenge to carry out this work. Finally, the
   combination of activities, between chess and strategic management
   knowledge is complicated to handle, requiring large doses of planning.
   These limitations are perhaps challenging to solve, although possible
   help could be associated with more teachers being involved in the
   process.
   Practical implications - The simultaneous learning of chess with the
   consequent increase of cognitive skills and Strategic Management
   concepts could intensify the motivation of the student and generate a
   virtuous circle that drives both areas.
   Originality/Value - This new experience in Spain contributes to filling
   a perhaps significant gap in the literature. In parallel, the practice
   of chess in the classroom has corroborated a level of commitment and
   motivation of students in the knowledge of the concepts of strategic
   management. The results achieved could suggest the incorporation of
   chess practice as a motivating factor in management subjects.},

Title = {Digital learning designs in physiotherapy education: a systematic review
   and meta-analysis},
Journal = {BMC MEDICAL EDUCATION},
Year = {2021},
Volume = {21},
Number = {1},
Month = {JAN 13},
Abstract = {Background: Digital learning designs have the potential to support
   teaching and learning within higher education. However, the research on
   digital learning designs within physiotherapy education is limited. This
   study aims to identify and investigate the effectiveness of digital
   learning designs in physiotherapy education.
   Methods: The study was designed as a systematic review and meta-analysis
   of randomized and non-randomized trials. A search of eight databases on
   digital learning designs and technology was conducted. Study selection,
   methodology and quality assessment were performed independently by three
   reviewers. The included studies were mapped according to the types of
   digital interventions and studies. For similar interventions, the
   learning effects were calculated using meta-analyses.
   Results: Altogether, 22 studies were included in the review (17
   randomized controlled trials and five cohort studies). A blended
   learning design was used in 21 studies, a flipped classroom model in
   five and a distance learning design in one. Altogether, 10 of the 22
   articles were included in meta-analyses, which showed statistically
   significant effects for flipped classrooms on knowledge acquisition
   (standardized mean difference {[}SMD]: 0.41; 95\% confidence interval
   {[}CI]: 0.20, 0.62), for interactive websites or applications (apps) on
   practical skills (SMD: 1.07; 95\% CI: 0.71,1.43) and for students
   self-produced videos on a practical skill in a cervical spine scenario
   (SMD: 0.49; 95\% CI: 0.06, 0.93). Overall, the effects indicated that
   blended learning designs are equally as or more effective than
   traditional classroom teaching to achieve learning outcomes. Distance
   learning showed no significant differences compared to traditional
   classroom teaching.
   Conclusions: The current findings from physiotherapy education indicate
   that digital learning designs in the form of blended learning and
   distance learning were equally or more effective compared to traditional
   teaching. The meta-analyses revealed significant effects on student
   learning in favour of the interventions using flipped classrooms,
   interactive websites/apps and students self-produced videos. However,
   these results must be confirmed in larger controlled trials. Further,
   research should investigate how digital learning designs can facilitate
   students' learning of practical skills and behaviour, learning retention
   and approaches to studying as well as references for teaching and
   learning in digital learning environments.},

Title = {The effectiveness of using blended learning teaching and learning
   strategy to develop students' performance at higher education},
Journal = {JOURNAL OF APPLIED RESEARCH IN HIGHER EDUCATION},
Abstract = {Purpose - The research aims to identify the effectiveness of using the
   blended learning strategy on achievement among students of higher
   colleges of technology in the United Arab Emirates (UAE), through the
   answer to the following question: Is there a statistically significant
   difference at the significance level (a = 0.05) in students'
   achievements in general studies courses at higher education attributed
   to the method of teaching (blended learning, traditional).
   Design/methodology/approach - The research applied a Quasi-experimental.
   The current research used two groups experimental group and controlled
   group across two phases: pilot study and experimental study. Phase 1
   examined the difference between the pilot group and the nonpilot group
   at Sharjah colleges across three different courses: Fundamentals of
   Applied Mathematics, Professional Communication and Reporting and Basic
   Research Methods during the spring semester 2019 at Sharjah colleges.
   Phase 2 examined the difference between the experimental group (using
   blended learning during summer 2019) and the controlled group (learned
   the same courses during summer 2018) across three different courses and
   the same three courses.
   Findings - There is no statistically significant difference at
   significance level (a = 0.05) in students' achievements in the
   Fundamentals of Applied Mathematics (LSM 1000) course between the
   experimental and controlled groups. There is a statistically significant
   difference at significance level (a = 0.05) in students' achievements in
   the Professional Communication and Reporting (LSC 1103) in favor of the
   experimental group course at higher education attributed to the method
   of teaching (blended learning, traditional). There is no statistically
   significant difference at significance level (a = 0.05) in students'
   achievements in the Basic Research Methods (LSS 1123) between the
   experimental and controlled groups.
   Research limitations/implications - 1. The study is limited to students
   of Higher Colleges of Technology in the UAE. 2. The study is limited to
   the General Studies Department at Higher Colleges of Technology. 3. The
   achievement test used in the study is a standardized test developed by
   the college.
   Originality/value - This research considered the first research to
   discuss the effectiveness of using blended learning where three teaching
   strategies are combined together (normal face-to-face classes, flipped
   classroom and online face-to-face classes) in students' achievement at
   higher education in the UAE.},

Abstract = {Objective Progress in electronic learning (e-learning) and health
   sciences education is an indicator of the national and international
   efforts to achieve sustainable development goals regarding good health
   and quality education. The objective of the current study was to
   describe research volume and trends on e-learning in the health sciences
   education. Methods A bibliometric methodology was adopted. The study
   period was from database inception until December 31, 2020. The data was
   downloaded from Scopus as a ``csv{''} file. The data was analyzed to
   reveal prominent contributing countries, institution, authorship
   patterns, the degree of collaboration, international research
   collaboration, prominent sources for publications, frequent author
   keywords, the impact of research in terms of citations, and healthcare
   groups targeted in research. Results In total, 4576 records were
   retrieved. The analysis revealed an increasing growth in number of
   publications with time. There was a sharp peak in 2020. Recent
   literature on e-learning in health education included keywords such as
   flipped classroom, mobile learning, blended learning, and COVID-19.
   Countries in the European region and the region of the Americas have the
   highest contribution while countries in the African and the South-East
   Asian region have the least contribution. There was an increasing trend
   in the degree of author collaboration with time. However, the extent of
   international research collaboration was inadequate. The USA had the
   least percentage of documents with international authors (18\%) while
   Sweden had the highest (70.6\%). Documents published from Canada had the
   highest number of citations per document. The Karolinska Institute,
   based in Sweden, was the most active institution. The Medical Teacher
   journal ranked first in the number of publications while documents
   published in the Academic Medicine journal received the highest number
   of citations per document. The bulk of the retrieved literature was
   about medical or nursing education. The retrieved documents had an
   average of 12.7 citations per document and an H-index of 81. Conclusion
   Data presented can be used to develop and enhance e-learning in health

Abstract = {Many engineering professors teach their classes without having received
   previous training in psycho-pedagogy and neuroscience. While a few of
   them have received some form of pedagogical training during their
   academic career, the vast majority have not acquired any training in the
   field of didactics, that is, in the science of teaching. Teaching is a
   difficult task, and teaching effectively is even more difficult. Much
   literature exists on different teaching-learning methodologies that have
   been empirically tested in engineering studies. However, practically
   none of these works make reference to the main factor in any learning
   process: how does the human brain learn? This paper analyses learning
   from the perspective of its three main phases (motivation, attention,
   memorization), and how these phases should be addressed in a lecture,
   since many of the Engineering classes at universities around the world
   are given as lectures. The current knowledge of neuroscience is used in
   the paper to provide twelve recommendations on how a lecture should be
   successfully given in Engineering Degrees. For the selection of these
   twelve tips, we use two criteria: they must be relevant in a lecture,
   and they must have a neuroscientific basis, which is explained in the
   framework of the paper. The relationship between the twelve tips and the
   seven principles of good practice in undergraduate studies enunciated by
   Chickering and Gamson has also been established. The relation of each
   tip with the learning phases to which it refers is explained, and an
   example of how to apply it in a lecture is given. This paper presents a
   new way of working in engineering education: how to apply the knowledge
   provided by neuroscience to the teaching-learning process. This work
   provides some ideas about how this can be done in a lecture, but it is
   also necessary to conduct experiments to validate the effectiveness of
   the twelve tips proposed herein. It is likewise necessary to carry out
   similar work for other teaching methodologies such as PBL, flipped
   classroom or service-learning. The future of education cannot be
   developed without taking into account the functioning of the human brain
   or by applying educational practices that are unsupported by scientific
   evidence of their effectiveness.},

Title = {Effectiveness of non-bedside teaching during the COVID-19 pandemic: a
   quasi-experimental study},
Journal = {BMC MEDICAL EDUCATION},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {22},
Number = {1},
Month = {JAN 31},
Abstract = {Background The COVID-19 pandemic poses a huge challenge for clinical
   teaching due to contact restrictions and social distancing. Medical
   teachers have to balance potential risks and benefits of bedside
   teaching, especially in course formats intended to foster practical
   clinical skills. In this context, we aimed to address the question,
   whether presence-based teaching formats without patient involvement are
   suitable to teach practical skills. Methods In this quasi-experimental
   study, presence-based teaching formats with and without patient contact
   were retrospectively compared regarding their effects on medical
   students' theoretical knowledge and practical skills, i.e. the
   performance and clinical interpretation of the neurological exam. To
   this end, evaluations from 102 students and their lecturers
   participating in a neurological bedside teaching course at a German
   university hospital between October 2020 and April 2021 were obtained.
   Students were initially randomly assigned to course dates. However, 53
   students assigned to courses in November and December 2020, were not
   able to go bedside due to contact restrictions. These students formed
   the interventional group and the remaining 49 students the control
   group. The primary outcome measures were students' overall grading of
   the course (school grades, 1-6) as well as ratings of knowledge and
   skills provided by the students themselves and their lecturers on a
   numerical rating scale (0-10). Comparison between groups was performed
   using frequentist and Bayesian t-statistics. Results The teaching format
   without patient contact received a significantly poorer overall grade by
   the students (p = 0.018). However, improvements in the students'
   self-ratings of knowledge and skills did not differ between the two
   formats (all p > 0.05, BF10max = 0.42). Moreover, especially practical
   skills were even rated significantly better in the group without patient
   contact by the lecturers (p < 0.001). Conclusions Teaching formats
   without patient contact are less well-received by the students. However,
   they are able to teach practical skills regarding the performance and
   clinical interpretation of examination techniques. Still, the
   evaluations obtained might not adequately capture the importance of
   bedside teaching in preparing future physicians for their practice.
   Perspectively, hybrid teaching approaches including flipped-classroom
   concepts hold considerable potential to enhance effectiveness of bedside
   teaching in the present pandemic situation and in the future.},

Abstract = {Purpose The purpose of this paper is to critically evaluate the learning
   effectiveness and engagement of blended learning tools in a management
   course of negotiation skills. The study addresses the dilemma brought to
   light through literature regarding the learning effectiveness of
   roleplays as a teaching tool in negotiation training. The study compares
   the impact of traditional roleplays vis-a-vis roleplays fused with
   blended tools on learner's performance. The endeavour is to investigate
   the learning effectiveness of traditional tools (roleplay simulation and
   lecture) vs blended learning tools (flipped classroom, massive open
   online courses, independent study fused with roleplay simulation).
   Design/methodology/approach The current study delves into a negotiation
   course to conduct experimental research comparing traditional and
   blended learning tools. The total number of students who participated in
   this study were 80. Findings The findings indicate the improved learning
   effectiveness of blended learning tools vis-a-vis traditional tools.
   Generation Z students were more engaged with the use of blended learning
   tools and enjoyed the experience. The study recommends blended learning
   tools for educators aiming to transition from traditional learning to
   interactive learning to create experiential classrooms. Research
   limitations/implications Limited sample size and single group
   experimentation are some limitations of the study. Some latent flaws in
   the implementation of roleplay simulations in negotiation training were
   revealed during the study. The study focuses solely on a negotiations
   course taught to management students. Practical implications The study
   would help academic institutes to comply with the pressing need to
   impart experiential learning in the classroom. The research would act as
   a bridge between the industry expectations and academia deliverables.
   Social implications The study would help academic institutes to comply
   with the pressing need to impart experiential learning through blended
   learning in the classroom. The research would act as a bridge between
   the industry expectations and academia deliverables. Originality/value
   The study addresses the dilemma in the literature, which, on the one
   hand, upholds the learning effectiveness of roleplays as a teaching
   tool, and on the other hand, suggests that roleplays have lost their
   applicability due to advancement in students' exposure to technology.
   The study in itself is unique, as it addresses the need for higher
   student engagement in the classroom.},

Title = {Factors affecting assignment completion in higher education},
Journal = {JOURNAL OF APPLIED RESEARCH IN HIGHER EDUCATION},
Year = {2020},
Volume = {12},
Number = {5},
Pages = {1251-1264},
Month = {FEB 28},
Abstract = {Purpose The purpose of this paper is to simultaneously investigate a
   variety of factors related to assignment completion (AC) (i.e. task
   orientation, cooperation, teacher feedback, time management and time
   spent on AC). Design/methodology/approach The study relied on a
   self-report survey to assess students' perceptions in relation to six
   variables. Participants included 1,106 undergraduate students from six
   public Thai universities. Analysis involved structural equation
   modeling. Findings This study provided new results related to task
   orientation as the strongest predictor of AC and time management.
   Cooperation and feedback improved AC with time management as an
   intervening variable. Time management and feedback did not predict time
   spent on AC.
   Research limitations/implications - Future studies might explore the
   potential range of assignments that, for example, count for a higher
   portion of the grade versus those that are less or unimportant in terms
   of the course. Future studies might also look at the role of group
   assignments in relation to completion. Semi-structured interviews or
   observations might provide insights into how students manage their time
   and why task orientation has the most effect on AC. Future research
   might investigate more specifically at what point time management does
   or does not affect completion. In general, given the growth of online
   learning and contexts in which students may be increasingly called on to
   complete assignments independently, factors such as those investigated
   in this study will require more attention in varying countries and
   contexts, generically and for individual subjects.
   Practical implications - Instructional designers and instructors can
   promote task orientation through reliance on strategic scaffolding. For
   designing a task-oriented environment, instructors need to offer
   challenging assignments. Instructors should also assign work that
   encourages motivation, effort and achievement. To ensure that
   cooperative learning positively affects time management, instructors and
   designers can allot specific in-class time for completion of tasks,
   reliance on flipped classroom activities and student conversations
   regarding time restrictions and time-management skills. Instructors can
   be supported to help them provide appropriate types of feedback, as well
   as ideas for implementing the feedback in practice.
   Originality/value Little research has been conducted on AC in higher
   education. Those studies that have been conducted have focused on the
   elementary and secondary levels. Furthermore, studies have not always
   taken into account the complex relationships between different factors
   that can potentially influence AC.},

Title = {A Study on Students' Perceptions for Online Zoom-app based Flipped Class
   Sessions on Anatomy Organised during the Lockdown Period of COVID-19
   Epoch},

Abstract = {Introduction: In the present situation of containment for COVID-19
   epoch, the physical classroom sessions in medical colleges were
   suspended by different Government advisories. Faculties have been guided
   by the university as well as institution to carry on the online teaching
   to the medical students. As the students were not present physically, so
   flipped class model has been implemented using the Zoom cloud app for
   teaching Anatomy.
   Aim: To explore the perception of undergraduate students of Anatomy
   regarding online Zoom-app based flipped class sessions and to obtain the
   suggestions for improvement of such classes organised during the
   lockdown period of COVID-19.
   Materials and Methods: Ten gross Anatomy topics and 10 histology slides
   (total 15 sessions; one session for each gross anatomy topics and five
   sessions covering two slides for each day) were discussed in flipped
   class mode. For each session, the text materials were served to the
   students two days before. On the third day, face to face interactive
   classes were undertaken using the Zoom platform; for the entire 199
   students of Anatomy. After completion of one month, students'
   perceptions were obtained by semi-structured questionnaire made with
   Google form.
   Results: Although the department has organised almost daily Zoom
   sessions with pre-shared study material; in flipped classroom mode, but
   majority of the students opined for maximum three days per week Zoom
   sessions instead of every day's classes. Total 92\% preferred the
   current strategy of advanced sharing of study material instead of
   concurrent sharing of text. Almost 93.5\% students felt the study
   material helpful to them, 79\% students found the Zoom sessions helpful
   for their doubt clearance. Strikingly, 40\% students confessed that they
   failed to keep up with the progress of the classes in daily mode. There
   was a mixed reaction for continuing such mode of teaching in the
   post-lockdown era. The network connectivity became a broad issue as
   constrain to almost all of them to participate in online discussion
   platform.
   Conclusion: As the students and teachers were new in the online mode of
   teaching; so students feedbacks were felt need for future planning. The
   students had an opinion to lessen the number of classes so that they can
   cope up with the study material. However, majority of them wanted to
   move back to their classrooms rather than remain in the online mode of
   learning.},

Title = {Opportunities and challenges of e-learning in vocational training in
   General Practice - a project report about implementing digital formats
   in the KWBW-Verbundweiterbildung(plus)},
Journal = {GMS JOURNAL FOR MEDICAL EDUCATION},
Year = {2020},
Volume = {37},
Number = {7},
Abstract = {Background: The task of the Competence Centers for vocational training
   (KW) is to increase the attractiveness and quality of vocational
   (=post-graduate) training in general practice. For this purpose, they
   offer, among other things, a structured seminar program for
   post-graduate trainees in general practice (GP-trainees). During the
   Covid-19 pandemic the seminar program of the
   KWBW-Verbundweiterbildung(plus)(R) in Baden-Wurttemberg was converted to
   digital formats. The goal of the paper is to evaluate the acceptance by
   the GP-trainees and lecturers, to describe experiences with the
   conversion to e-learning and to derive recommendations with regard to
   the future orientation of seminar programs in postgraduate as well as
   continuing medical education.
   The implementation was based on a modified Kern-cycle and aimed at
   offering eight teaching units of 45 minutes each to a large number of
   GP-trainees. It tried to maintain the high quality of content and
   education as well as the interactive character of the previous seminars.
   For this purpose, the events were designed as synchronous webinars (six
   units) with asynchronous preparation and post-processing (two units)
   according to the flipped classroom method. The evaluation by the
   participating GP-trainees and lecturers was performed online using a
   multi-center developed and pre-piloted questionnaire.
   Results and discussion: N=101 GP-trainees participated in the evaluation
   of five individual seminar days in the second quarter of 2020 (response
   rate 97\%). 58\% (N=59) of the trainees were satisfied or very satisfied
   with the implementation. 82\% (n=83) rated pre-tasks as helpful. 99\%
   (n=100) would participate in an online seminar again. For 52\% (n=53) of
   the trainees, the attitude towards e-learning had changed positively.
   The main advantages mentioned were no travel, save in time and costs as
   well as increased flexibility. The main disadvantages mentioned were
   less personal interaction and technical obstacles.
   The high acceptance of the new digital format showed the fundamental
   potential of e-learning in continuing medical education. The experiences
   can be a source of inspiration for other departments and KW. However, it
   also shows that important goals of KW, such as the personal interaction
   of the peer group, could not be achieved. In the future, it is important
   to develop a suitable mix of presence and digital formats with the aim
   to improve the attractiveness as well as sustainability of continuing
   medical education.},

Abstract = {Blended learning has steadily gained in popularity at the higher levels
   of education. This marks a change in pedagogical approaches from
   one-directional instruction to an interactive and technology-aided
   class. However, to manage fluent in-class activities and proper data
   analysis, real-time and fine-grained data collection activities are
   still needed. We propose an approach which provides rich information
   about student activities and automates processes which are
   time-consuming and which otherwise require extraneous effort. First, we
   implemented a program to collect real-time and fine-grained data and to
   provide an integrated experience during in-class activities. Second, we
   undertook a data analysis with the collected real-time, fine-grained
   data. Our blended learning is a type of flipped learning with personal
   response systems (PRSs) of the type commonly known as clickers. We used
   clickers for attendance, quizzes, and daily surveys, and collected the
   resulting data. Our outcome shows that the blended learning approach
   improves student achievement levels with a relatively small standard
   deviation compared to traditional classes. In addition, the present
   findings are factors related to student satisfaction and seat position,
   as analyzed from the data collected using the clickers.},

Title = {Pilot Study of an Online Self-Directed Learning Module for Medical

Pages = {408-412},
Month = {AUG},
Abstract = {Objective This study assessed the impact of an online, self-directed
   learning module on medical student knowledge and attitudes regarding
   decision-making capacity. Methods The authors created a 15-min didactic
   video on decision-making capacity and sorted medical students on the
   psychiatry clerkship to teaching as usual or teaching as usual plus
   watching the video. The authors assessed student knowledge about and
   attitudes toward decisional capacity assessment using a pre/posttest
   design. Results Thirty-eight students completed the study (24\% of all
   psychiatry clerkship students in one academic year). Students who
   watched the video (n = 14) achieved higher scores on the posttest
   compared with students who did not watch the video (n = 24) (90\% vs
   84\% on general knowledge and case examples), though this difference was
   small and not statistically significant. The degree of improvement from
   pretest to posttest was higher for students who watched the video but
   did not reach statistical significance. Conclusions Overall, students
   found the online teaching module to be a helpful augmentation strategy
   for learning decisional capacity assessment. The authors incorporated
   student feedback and additional review to create an enhanced video,
   which is available on ADMSEP's Clinical Simulation Initiative website.},

Title = {Video delivery of toxicology educational content versus textbook for
   asynchronous learning, using acetaminophen overdose as a topic},
Journal = {CLINICAL TOXICOLOGY},
Year = {2019},
Volume = {57},
Number = {10},
Pages = {842-846},
Month = {OCT 3},
Abstract = {Objectives: Advances in technology have brought with them innovations in
   delivery of medical educational content; for example, audio and video
   podcasts, flipped classroom learning, and e-books. These new modalities
   may be useful for delivery of content asynchronously, as an adjunct to
   traditional lecture-based and bedside clinical teaching. Here, we
   measured the differences in knowledge acquisition between medical
   students using a video-based content delivery method and students using
   a traditional method of asynchronous content delivery (a textbook
   chapter). We also measured student preferences regarding asynchronous
   content delivery. Methods: A 4.5-minute educational video was created by
   a content expert using VideoScribe software. Acetaminophen toxicity was
   selected as the sample topic. Survey Monkey software was used to create
   a pre-test, post-test, and to gather data regarding student preferences.
   Students were given the pre-test, then they were randomized to either
   read a chapter on acetaminophen overdose from an emergency medicine
   reference text or to view the video; they were then given the post-test
   and the preferences survey. The results were then categorized and
   analysed using descriptive statistics and linear regression. Results:
   Sixty-nine student responses were initiated, 14 of whom did not complete
   the full survey, leaving 55 students who were included in the final
   analysis. Fifteen first year, 27 second-year, 8 third-year, and 5
   fourth-year students participated. Twenty-eight students were randomized
   to reading the textbook chapter, and 31 were randomized to view the
   video; 4 students in the textbook group did not finish the educational
   activity. On average, students who took the video training correctly
   answered 1.1 (95\% CI: 0.1-2.2, p = .03) more questions correctly after
   adjusting for pretest score and year in medical school than those who
   read the textbook chapter. A preference for watching a video over
   reading a textbook chapter was expressed by 78.4\% of students, while
   98\% of students either agreed or strongly agreed with the statement
   that they would be comfortable using the internet to learn new concepts.
   No students reported that they were very satisfied and 57\% of students
   reported being satisfied reading the textbook chapter, while 93.3\% were
   either satisfied or very satisfied viewing the video. Conclusions: Video
   delivery of educational content was associated with higher student
   satisfaction and relative improvement in score compared to textbook.
   Students overall expressed comfort using the internet and new technology
   to obtain new medical education. The authors were involved with creation
   of the video and quiz, which may confound results. Future exploration
   into retention of knowledge could be warranted.},

Abstract = {Fostering students' abilities to deal with practical problems is an
   important objective of professional training. To enable students to have
   more practicing time under the supervision of trainers in class, flipped
   learning has been adopted to shift the lecture time to the before-class
   stage, and hence more time is available for in-class practicing.
   Although flipped learning has been recognized by scholars as an
   effective teaching mode, researchers have also indicated the challenges
   of implementing it; in particular, many students have difficulty
   learning before the class on their own. In this research, a
   self-regulated flipped learning approach was proposed to cope with this
   problem by guiding students to set their learning goals, and supporting
   them in monitoring their learning status in five stages, namely, goal
   setting, flipped learning (including pre-class video-based instruction
   and in-class discussion), task sharing, self-evaluation, and
   self-regulation feedback. In addition, an experiment was conducted in a
   professional training program to examine the effectiveness of the
   proposed approach. From the experimental results, it was found that the
   approach significantly improved the students' learning achievement,
   self-efficacy, self-regulation, and critical thinking, which could be a
   good reference for future research related to flipped professional
   training.},

Abstract = {The purpose of this study was to examine the undergraduate students'
   adoption of video lessons. The data were collected from 313
   undergraduate students from Education, Health Sciences, and Letters
   Faculties within a large university in Turkey using a questionnaire with
   six constructs: ease of use, usefulness, enjoyment, intention, computer
   self-efficacy and relative advantage. The Technology Acceptance Model
   and Diffusion of Innovation Theory were used as the research framework
   for the study, and the data were analysed by Structural Equation
   Modeling. The results showed that ease of use and computer self-efficacy
   had a significant influence on usefulness of video lessons. Computer
   self-efficacy had a significant influence on ease of use regarding video
   lessons and usefulness of a video lesson had a significant influence on
   relative advantage. In addition, relative advantage and enjoyment had a
   significant effect on student intention to use a video lesson.
   Interestingly, it was found that perceived ease of use, perceived
   usefulness, and computer self-efficacy had no effect on the intention to
   use video lessons. Consequently, five constructs account for 38\% of the
   variance intention to use video lessons. The research model was found to
   have a good fit.},

Title = {Medical Morphology Training Using the Xuexi Tong Platform During the
   COVID-19 Pandemic: Development and Validation of a Web-Based Teaching
   Approach},
Journal = {JMIR MEDICAL INFORMATICS},
Year = {2021},
Volume = {9},
Number = {3},
Month = {MAR},
Abstract = {Background: Histology and Embryology and Pathology are two important
   basic medical morphology courses for studying human histological
   structures under healthy and pathological conditions, respectively.
   There is a natural succession between the two courses. At the beginning
   of 2020, the COVID-19 pandemic suddenly swept the world. During this
   unusual period, to ensure that medical students would understand and
   master basic medical knowledge and to lay a solid foundation for future
   medical bridge courses and professional courses, a web-based medical
   morphology teaching team, mainly including teachers of courses in
   Histology and Embryology and Pathology, was established.
   Objective: This study aimed to explore a new teaching mode of Histology
   and Embryology and Pathology courses during the COVID-19 pandemic and to
   illustrate its feasibility and acceptability.
   Methods: From March to July 2020, our team selected clinical medicine
   undergraduate students who started their studies in 2018 and 2019 as
   recipients of web-based teaching. Meanwhile, nursing undergraduate
   students who started their studies in 2019 and 2020 were selected for
   traditional offline teaching as the control group. For the web-based
   teaching, our team used the Xuexi Tong platform as the major platform to
   realize a new ``seven-in-one{''} teaching method (ie, videos, materials,
   chapter tests, interactions, homework, live broadcasts, and case
   analysis/discussion). This new teaching mode involved diverse web-based
   teaching methods and contents, including flipped classroom,
   screen-to-screen experimental teaching, a drawing competition, and a
   writing activity on the theme of ``What I Know About COVID-19.{''} When
   the teaching was about to end, a questionnaire was administered to
   obtain feedback regarding the teaching performance. In the meantime, the
   final written pathology examination results of the web-based teaching
   and traditional offline teaching groups were compared to examine the
   mastery of knowledge of the students.
   Results: Using the Xuexi Tong platform as the major platform to conduct
   ``seven-in-one{''} teaching is feasible and acceptable. With regard to
   the teaching performance of this new web based teaching mode, students
   demonstrated a high degree of satisfaction, and the questionnaire showed
   that 71.3\% or more of the students in different groups reported a
   greater degree of satisfaction or being very satisfied. In fact, more
   students achieved high scores (90-100) in the web-based learning group
   than in the offline learning control group (P=.02). Especially, the
   number of students with objective scores >60 in the web-based learning
   group was greater than that in the offline learning control group
   (P=.045).
   Conclusions: This study showed that the web based teaching mode was not
   inferior to the traditional offline teaching mode for medical morphology
   courses, proving the feasibility and acceptability of web-based teaching
   during the COVID-19 pandemic. Our findings lay a solid theoretical
   foundation for follow-up studies of medical students.},

Title = {An Interactive, Multimodal Curriculum to Teach Pediatric Cardiology to
   House Staff},
Journal = {PEDIATRIC CARDIOLOGY},
Abstract = {Pediatricians must be able to diagnose, triage, and manage infants and
   children with congenital heart disease. The pediatric cardiology
   division at the Medical University of South Carolina updated their
   curriculum for pediatric residents to a format supported by
   constructivist learning theory. The purpose of this study is to
   determine if shorter, interactive learning with fellow and faculty
   involvement improved pediatric cardiology knowledge demonstrated through
   test scores and resident satisfaction. A curriculum of short lectures
   and interactive workshops was delivered over 6 weeks in August and
   September 2018. Residents answered a 10-question pretest prior to the
   curriculum, followed by a post-test immediately after the last session
   and a delayed post-test 8 months later. Residents also provided
   summative feedback on the educational sessions. Sixty-six residents were
   eligible to participate in the curriculum with 44 (67\%) completing the
   pretest, 40 (61\%) completing the post-test, and 33 (50\%) completing
   the delayed post-test. The mean score increased significantly from 56 to
   68\% between the pretest and post-test (p = 0.0018). The delayed
   post-test mean score remained high at 71\% without significant change (p
   = 0.46). Overall feedback was positive highlighting the interactive
   nature of lectures and the participation of cardiology fellows. Using an
   interactive, multimodal educational series, pediatric residents had a
   significant increase in pediatric cardiology test scores and
   demonstrated good retention.},

Abstract = {Wilderness medicine (WM) education has traditionally been conducted as
   in-person training. The current COVID-19 pandemic has forced medical
   schools to cancel clerkships and clinical electives and pivot to remote
   education. With online media modalities, it is possible to conduct a WM
   student elective remotely. The use of recorded audio lectures,
   instructional videos, choice-based simulations, and video conferencing
   allows students access to nearly all necessary content under the
   guidance of instructors. Although hands-on practicums are still
   essential to WM education, the process outlined here enables a temporary
   alternative during the time of necessary social distancing.},

Abstract = {Teaching the medical sciences using team-based learning (TBL) is a
   complex task, which requires knowledge of both the subject matter and
   pedagogy. To deal with these increased demands on the teacher, a
   strategy where every TBL session is co-taught by a Content Expert and a
   Facilitator was implemented. Twelve classroom sessions focusing on the
   interaction between these groups of teachers and their contribution in
   class were observed. There are quantitative and qualitative differences
   in the nature of the questions that they ask. The findings provide
   insight into how effective TBL sessions arise from complementary
   questioning strategies from these parties.},

   This qualitative phenomenology study included records review from 130
   accelerated second-degree undergraduate nursing students and a focus
   group and interviews to discover what motivates students to prepare for
   class. The data analysis revealed five prominent themes: knowing what to
   study, deep learning, accountability, getting into the textbook, and
   content engagement. The study validated several interventions that
   successfully motivate students to prepare for class.},

Title = {Analysis of a multifaceted interactive pedagogy program in an upper limb
   anatomy course: A time series study},
Journal = {ANATOMICAL SCIENCES EDUCATION},
Abstract = {Many new methods have contributed to the learning of anatomy, including
   several interactive methods, increasing the effectiveness of educational
   programs. The effectiveness of an educational program involving several
   interactive learning methods such as problem-based learning and
   reciprocal peer teaching was researched in this study. A
   quasi-experimental before-after study on three consecutive groups of
   second-year students at the Grenoble School of Medicine was conducted.
   The lectures were replaced by an educational program based on the
   problem-based learning method and reciprocal peer teaching. The first
   session was dedicated to reading clinical cases illustrating the medical
   concept, so that the learning objectives for the second session could be
   set. Then, after viewing digital courses, the second session was
   dedicated to a synthetic presentation by the students themselves,
   followed by an interactive summary with the teacher. The analysis of 630
   students showed a significant increase in the theory test results for
   those who took part in the intervention: 9.71 versus 9.19 (beta = 0.57,
   P = 0.036). Moreover, satisfaction was high after the intervention (mean
   = 4.5/5), and when comparing the two pedagogical approaches the students
   showed a clear preference for the program implemented with the concepts
   highlighted such as interactivity, in-depth work, group work, and
   autonomy. A multifaceted interactive pedagogy program could have a
   significant impact on the results of the theoretical concepts presented
   and on satisfaction as well as increased investment by students in
   learning anatomy.},

Abstract = {Neurologists regularly confront complex clinical scenarios that require
   the application of ethical principles to achieve a respectful and fair
   resolution. In this article, we describe the types of ethically
   precarious scenarios neurologists encounter, the current status of
   standards for ethics and communication training for neurology residents,
   and the present practice of ethics training in neurology residency
   programs. We make recommendations for optimizing bioethics training for
   neurology residents and suggest methods for assessing the efficacy of
   these training initiatives. We emphasize the current need for
   strengthening the practical bioethics skills of neurologists.},

Abstract = {In this paper, I outline the challenges that I faced in teaching an
   enterprise modeling (EM) course after I lost the ability to have
   face-to-face interactions and describe a solution that proved to be at
   least equally effective and appreciated when moved online. The revised
   course design primarily adopted exercise and assignment work, provided
   course content in a ``piecemeal{''} fashion, and relied almost
   exclusively on asynchronous interactions. I distill the solution into
   specific and more general design principles that educators can apply to
   other EM courses (and potentially beyond).},

Abstract = {University instructors have increasingly turned to flipped classrooms as
   a way to promote engaged, student-centered learning. At the same time,
   scholars across disciplines have shown the power of visual assignments
   for developing critical thinking and achieving higher level learning. In
   this article I discuss a flipped class design that uses
   student-generated photography in the Political science classroom to
   cement core concepts, help students critically analyze and evaluate
   academic theory, encourage students to identify class concepts in their
   daily lives, and develop a dynamic learning environment that encourages
   active participation both in and outside of the class.},

Abstract = {Contribution: An improved inverted lecturing (IIL) framework based on
   blending flipped lectures and hands-on experiments provides
   instructional benefits, compared to traditional teaching (TT) and
   inverted lecturing (IL), in an introductory course in digital systems.
   Background: IL has proven more effective than TT in improving student
   learning in engineering courses, but has mostly been used for theory
   sessions. The impact of combining inverted lectures and hands-on
   experiments on student learning has not still been thoroughly assessed
   in engineering courses. Intended Outcomes: Attendance, marks, and
   satisfaction should improve for students in IL-based theory lectures,
   compared with those receiving TT, and should improve still further for
   students receiving the IIL-based method. Workload both for student and
   instructor should not increase significantly. Application Design: The
   three methods were compared in six consecutive offerings of the course.
   In the first two, TT was used for both theory and laboratory classes; in
   the next two, IL was used for theory lectures; and in the final two
   offerings the IIL-based scheme was used. The instructor, intended
   learning outcomes (ILOs), course syllabus, and student grading scheme
   were constant over the six semesters. A total of 184 students with
   similar backgrounds participated. Findings: Students under the IL- and
   IIL-based frameworks were more engaged than those receiving TT, and were
   more satisfied with their learning process. The IIL-based learners
   achieved the deepest conceptual understanding. Finally, the IL- and
   IIL-based methods did not significantly increase workload for either the
   students or the instructor.},

Title = {Learning about the economic analysis of inequality through team-based
   learning},
Journal = {REVISTA DE EDUCACION},

Month = {JAN-MAR},
Abstract = {Introduction: We seek to describe how students' conceptual knowledge
   about the economic analysis of inequality and their ability to apply it
   changed through a contextualized team-based learning (TBL) process
   carried out in the Bachelor's of Business Administration and Management
   program at the University of Barcelona.
   Method: Data was collected in 2018-2019 from a sample of 318 students
   distributed in five groups. Data was collected three times, using an
   initial individual test (Ci), a test carried out in teams during class
   time (Cg), and a final individual exam (Pfa). Percentages of students
   who passed and mean scores were analyzed quantitatively, and we compared
   changes overall, within groups and between groups.
   Results: We observed a clear positive change for the whole sample and
   for each group between Ci and Cg, for both conceptual knowledge and its
   application. The mean scores improved by 49.8\%, while passing
   percentages grew by 30\%. In contrast, this positive trend was reversed
   between Cg and Pfa in the application of knowledge, although we found
   substantial intergroup differences, attributable to differences in the
   Pfa.
   Conclusion: The TBL process contributed to students' conceptual
   knowledge of the economic analysis of inequality, suggesting that
   teamwork favors the learning of elementary cognitive processes such as
   remembering and understanding. In contrast, while a certain degree of
   reversal between Cg and Pfa was expected, intergroup differences in
   knowledge application suggest that, despite what the literature has
   sometimes suggested, group tests for knowledge application in TBL should
   be identical, rather than merely comparable.},

   experiences focusing on pathological neurologic exam findings.
   Qualitative and quantitative data were collected from end-of-course

Title = {Active Learning in Psychiatry Education: Current Practices and Future
   Perspectives},

Abstract = {Over the past few decades, medical education has seen increased interest
   in the use of active learning formats to engage learners and promote
   knowledge application over knowledge acquisition. The field of
   psychiatry, in particular, has pioneered a host of novel active learning
   paradigms. These have contributed to our understanding of the role of
   andragogy along the continuum of medical education, from undergraduate
   to continuing medical education. In an effort to frame the successes and
   failures of various attempts at integrating active learning into
   healthcare curricula, a group of educators from the A. B. Baker Section
   on Neurological Education from the American Academy of Neurology
   reviewed the state of the field in its partner field of medical
   neuroscience. Herein we provide a narrative review of the literature,
   outlining the basis for implementing active learning, the novel formats
   that have been used, and the lessons learned from qualitative and
   quantitative analysis of the research that has been done to date. While
   preparation time seems to present the greatest obstacle to acceptance
   from learners and educators, there is generally positive reception to
   the new educational formats. Additionally, most assessments of trainee
   performance have suggested non-inferiority (if not superiority).
   However, occasional mixed findings point to a need for better
   assessments of the type of learning that these new formats engender:
   knowledge application rather than acquisition. Moreover, this field is
   relatively nascent and, in order to ascertain how best to integrate
   active learning into psychiatry education, a framework for quantitative
   outcome assessments is needed going forward.},

Title = {Using Technology Adoption Theories to Maximize the Uptake of E-learning
   in Medical Education},
Journal = {MEDICAL SCIENCE EDUCATOR},
Abstract = {Introduction While the use of e-learning tools in medical education is
   guided by robust literature on their design and evaluation, there is
   sparse literature on strategies that maximize their adoption among
   trainees. Methods In this scoping review, we searched Web of Science for
   studies on technology adoption theories as applied to education, using a
   final censoring date of August 1, 2021. Results Based on our findings,
   we identified three representative theories: (1) technology acceptance
   model, (2) technology adoption life cycle, and (3) domestication theory.
   Discussion We describe these theories in detail, examine their prior
   applications, and propose specific uses within medical e-learning.},

Abstract = {The use of video productions in chemistry courses, though pedagogically
   beneficial, is not sufficient in and of itself. Students must also be
   willing to engage with these productions, especially when the videos are

   implementation of two simple but effective strategies to promote student
   engagement with prelecture videos in a sophomore organic chemistry
   course. These two strategies, e-mail reminders and online homework
   assignments, represent easy-to-implement tools that have allowed us to
   achieve consistently high levels of student engagement with assigned

Abstract = {Objective: The objective of this review was to collate and map gross
   anatomy curricular and pedagogical approaches for physiotherapy
   students.
   Introduction: Knowledge of anatomy is essential for physiotherapy
   clinical diagnosis, treatment effectiveness and safe practice. The
   information on this topic is sparse, and what does exist is diverse.
   This scoping review describes anatomy educational approaches for
   physiotherapy students and provides needed insight into this topic.
   Inclusion criteria: No limits were applied on the date of the database
   search or age of participants. Languages were limited to English,
   French, German and Spanish. Studies had to include information on gross
   anatomy curricula or pedagogy for physiotherapy students, or information
   from qualified physiotherapists or those teaching gross anatomy to
   physiotherapy students.
   Methods: Included studies were mainly sourced from EBSCOhost (CINAHL,
   ERIC and MEDLINE), PubMed and Scopus databases. Perusal of reference
   lists facilitated further retrievals. Studies published from inception
   up to 21 July 2019 were included. Studies were identified and screened,
   and the process was reported in a PRISMA flow diagram. JBI methodology
   for scoping reviews was followed. Selected studies were charted
   according to a template created and published in a JBI scoping review
   protocol.
   Results: Fifty-four studies satisfied the inclusion criteria. Various
   studies gave calculable length of intervention in weeks (n=14, 26\%),
   hours (n=7, 13\%) or both (n=21, 39\%). The majority of studies (n=50,
   93\%) were cross-sectional studies; three were randomized controlled
   trials (6\%). Mean sample sizes varied from 55.330.4 (professional
   behaviors, ethical and humanistic aspects) to 323.2 +/- 219.7
   participants (multi-modal and blended learning). Overall, 29 studies
   (54\%) included physiotherapy students or personnel in physiotherapy
   anatomy programs exclusively in the sample. Other disciplines with
   physiotherapy students included medical students (n=12, 22\%), and
   occupational therapy students (n=10, 19\%). The interprofessional
   education category (n=8) determined that interdisciplinary teamwork led
   to increased anatomical learning and awareness of future clinical roles.
   Computer-assisted learning (n=9) was effective as a stand-alone or
   adjunct pedagogy, useful for self-study and helped anatomical knowledge
   retention. Team-based learning (n=2), peer teaching (n=6) and clinical
   input incorporating case-based learning and horizontal and vertical
   integration (n=4) resulted in anatomical knowledge retention and were
   associated with mastery of anatomical understanding, an increase in
   examination confidence and higher examination grades. Contradictory
   learning outcomes resulted from the use of online videos in blended and
   multi-model learning studies (n=7). Increased student participation in
   asynchronous online discussion forums benefitted academic learning
   outcomes. The category of curriculum, pedagogy and materials (n=15)
   identified and compared different survey results pertaining to the
   curricular aspect of the objectives of this review. One study
   investigated the flipped classroom concept. The use of anatomy content
   to encourage professional, ethical and humanistic aspects (n=3) of
   physiotherapy students' behavior resulted in positive outcomes.
   Conclusions: This scoping review revealed a multi-faceted topic with
   many types of interventions and outcomes recorded. It identified
   variations in pedagogies, curricular content and learning approaches
   integral to the subject and their impact on gross anatomy education for
   this population. Beneficial behavioral, anatomical learning, knowledge
   retention and academic outcomes were identified.},

Title = {Teaching research methods to undergraduate dental students},
Journal = {JOURNAL OF UNIVERSITY TEACHING AND LEARNING PRACTICE},
Year = {2021},
Volume = {18},
Number = {2, SI},
Abstract = {The provision of undergraduate statistics teaching varies across UK
   dental schools, but some challenges are faced in all schools. These
   include the need to (i) demonstrate the relevance of statistics to
   dentistry, (ii) address the phenomenon of statistical anxiety likely to
   be experienced, and (iii) deliver the teaching with a limited number of
   statistically trained staff. Our objective was to design a research
   methods course that combined epidemiology and statistics teaching for
   undergraduates at Bristol Dental School (University of Bristol) that was
   clinically relevant, focused on concepts and interpretation rather than
   calculation, and was sustainable, using new technology to enhance
   learning. The research methods course was introduced in 2008,
   extensively developed over the next two years based on student and tutor
   feedback, and has run with only minor updates ever since. The aim of the
   course is to introduce year 2 dental students to the skills needed to
   practice evidence-based dentistry, i.e. understand and critically
   appraise published research. Basic epidemiological concepts, different
   types of study design, summarising and interpreting data, and choosing
   appropriate statistical analyses are covered. The course is introduced
   by a face-to-face lecture. This emphasises the relevance to future
   careers, and pre-empts the feelings of statistical anxiety by presenting
   evidence that exam results for this course are not associated with
   having achieved an A-level in mathematics. The rest of the course is
   delivered using the flipped classroom approach. Didactic teaching is in
   the form of nine e-lectures, each lasting 20-25 minutes. These are split
   into chapters to allow easy navigation, and include pop-up questions.
   Small group (up to 10 students) structured tutorials (one per e-lecture)
   are used to reinforce the material covered in the e-lectures, drawing on
   real clinical examples from research publications. They are interactive,
   and also include e-voting quizzes to allow the tutors and students to
   gauge the level of understanding that is being achieved. At the end of
   the course there is a revision session and written assessment, which
   must be passed before students can progress to year 3 of the dental
   degree. Approximately 70 students take the course each year, split into
   eight groups, and tutorials are based on pre-prepared materials.
   Tutoring on this course provides an attractive opportunity to gain
   teaching experience, with only a modest investment in time. Therefore,
   it has always been possible to recruit enough statisticians or
   epidemiologists in the Faculty of Health Sciences, University of Bristol
   to act as tutors. At least 89\% of the students have passed the exam on
   first sitting each year, and all students have passed their re-sit exam.
   Marks ranged from 50-86\% in 2019, and similar ranges were seen in
   previous years. Student feedback is consistently high, with virtually
   all students rating all components of the course at least satisfactory,
   and high percentages rating them good or excellent (e-lectures and
   tutorials were rated to be good or excellent by 72\% and 95\% of the
   students respectively in 2019). External examiners have been very
   complimentary, and only ever requested minor changes. Hence it has been
   possible to run a sustainable research methods course that engages
   students' interest and produces excellent learning outcomes.},

   online teaching in most chemistry courses in the spring semester, 2020.
   While online lectures have been available for a small number of courses
   in the previous semesters, it is unprecedented that most lectures should
   be given online. In this communication, we describe how higher education
   in chemistry has been made in the spring semester, 2020, mainly based on
   the experience of the author and colleagues, and address the insights
   gained that we would like to share. Admittedly, the experience is
   limited, and there are still unresolved challenges.},

Title = {Engaging family medicine residents in research training: An innovative
   research skills program in Israel},
Journal = {EDUCATION FOR HEALTH},
Year = {2019},
Volume = {32},

Abstract = {Background: The importance of medical research in developing academic
   and clinical excellence is widely acknowledged. Obstacles hindering
   research in primary care include negative attitudes, lack of dedicated
   time, funding shortages, and a relative paucity of mentors. Residency is
   the appropriate stage for developing research skills and encouraging
   research performance. In this article, we describe an intensive research
   training program offered at the family medicine (FM) Department,
   Technion Faculty of Medicine in Haifa, Israel. The program aims to
   engage residents in FM in constructing a research protocol to provide
   them with a positive experience, help them to overcome barriers, and
   enhance their research performance. Methods: Learning is achieved
   through a course design that includes the following six components: (1)
   course website: a platform for online collaborative learning; (2)
   inverted classroom: theory is learned through website video lectures and
   presentations during resident's own time according to a guided schedule,
   while weekly classroom sessions are dedicated to step-by-step
   implementation of theory, group discussion, and individual mentoring;
   (3) Peer feedback; (4) personal mentoring; (5) presentation of the
   protocol to peers and senior department staff at the end of the course;
   and (6) evaluation of protocol presentation and engagement during the
   research course as well as possibilities for further development.
   Results: Five teams of residents went on to conduct full research
   projects. Their studies have been presented at seven national and three

   these studies have been useful in FM practices and have inspired

Abstract = {The disruption of education services during major crises poses a
   challenge for international agencies, governments, schools, and
   communities. The article demonstrates a potential role for mobile
   technologies in supporting continuity of education delivery during
   temporary school closures caused by such crises. Discussing how school
   administrators can reduce the impact on students, this article describes
   an interactive online educational environment and outlines the
   advantages of available mobile learning devices for this purpose. With
   proper training, teachers can integrate mobile learning tools in both
   classroom activities and out-of-classroom learning. The article will be
   of interest to educational policy makers and school administrators with
   responsibility for ensuring continued education delivery in the
   aftermath of major crises.},

Abstract = {This account reports building a community of practice for organic
   chemistry instructors. With support from Chemistry Collaborations,
   Workshops, and Communities of Scholars (cCWCS), a group of organic
   chemistry faculty facilitated multiple workshops to introduce active
   learning techniques to their colleagues across the country. A Web site,
   organicers.org, has been developed to serve as a community hub to aid
   faculty creating more student-centered environments in their classrooms.
   It serves as a repository for useful materials such as active learning
   questions, exams, syllabi, and lab experiments among others. The
   community of practice for organic chemistry instructors interested in
   active learning is expanding through participation and collegial
   support.},

Abstract = {Contemporary pedagogy encourages instructors to move away from

   environment, students are taught to apply knowledge of economic
   measurement, the economic model, and economic policy to analyze current

   exercises and assignments that comprise an entire course. The course
   discussed in this article is a large enrollment introductory course and
   presents a novel approach to active learning, adapted to this
   often-challenging context. The course emphasizes engaging students by

Abstract = {The authors of this article describe the design and implementation of a
   multi-site randomized controlled trial of team-based learning (TBL)
   application exercises (AE) in introductory economics courses that use
   TBL. For each of the four study modules that are common across sites, a
   site is assigned to either the treatment or control version of the
   module. This design enables the use of a fixed effects model to estimate
   the effect of treatment on student learning and control for student
   characteristics. The methodology demonstrates how to extract the
   benefits of multi-site randomized controlled designs using a minimum of
   resources. The authors also discuss the challenges and the lessons
   learned in this study.},

Abstract = {Personalized medicine is being realized by our ability to measure
   biological and environmental information about patients. Much of these
   data are being stored in electronic health records yielding big data
   that presents challenges for its management and analysis. Here, we
   review several areas of knowledge that are necessary for next-generation
   scientists to fully realize the potential of biomedical big data. We
   begin with an overview of big data and its storage and management. We
   then review statistics and data science as foundational topics followed
   by a core curriculum of artificial intelligence, machine learning and
   natural language processing that are needed to develop predictive models
   for clinical decision making. We end with some specific training
   recommendations for preparing next-generation scientists for biomedical
   big data.},

Abstract = {Does attendance matter? This question has still not been answered
   conclusively. In general, studies find positive but mostly weak
   correlations between attendance and performance. However, due to
   technological changes in learning, attendance in higher education seems
   to lose its importance since students do not have to attend class to get
   access to course material. The question that arises is whether
   information on purely descriptive attendance is sufficient to prove the
   positive effects of attendance on performance. This study takes a closer
   look at the link between attendance and performance, examining classroom
   engagement dimensions as mediating factors. The results suggest that it
   does not matter if but rather how students attend class.},

Abstract = {Scaffolded inverse blended learning (SIBL) enables self-paced,
   individualized learning by incorporating different levels of learning
   activities. The SIBL approach is described for an online general
   chemistry course enhanced with face-to-face interactions for first-year
   students in an institute of higher learning. It can be easily modified
   and implemented in situations where learning is disrupted (i.e.,
   COVID-19 pandemic). Due to the COVID-19 pandemic, all schools and
   institutes of higher learning are required to transit into home-based
   learning. It could also be adapted by other courses. Students' feedback
   and performance indicate that the SIBL approach increases engagement in
   learning and develops students' ability to solve higher level problems.},

Abstract = {An elevator pitch is a short summary used to quickly and simply define a
   process, product, service, organization, or event and its value
   proposition. The name comes from the idea that it should be possible to
   deliver the summary within the time span of an elevator ride, so
   anywhere between 30 seconds and 2 minutes, which means the key points
   need to get across quickly. In this particular educational context,
   technical students have been encouraged to defend, under the typical
   rules of the elevator pitch, the knowledge acquired during the semester
   in a specific subject. This contribution focuses on the classroom
   experience and how the transversality of the activity can help students
   to strive and think in a different way than they are used to in the
   classroom of a technical career.},

Abstract = {There is a need for innovative approaches in the classroom to increase
   student preparedness to address and solve some of today's complex social
   problems. Interdisciplinary courses can be one way to accomplish this.
   This is an exploratory study to examine if an interdisciplinary
   web-based video series is associated with improvements in
   interdisciplinary competence. The course is taught using a flipped
   pedagogical approach in which a web-based interdisciplinary video series
   first delivers exposure of content to students and class time is then
   spent in solving real world problems in interdisciplinary teams. Goals
   of the study include introducing an innovative approach to teaching
   interdisciplinary courses, examining if it is associated with an
   improvement in interdisciplinary competence, and evaluating student
   receptivity. In this paper we describe this approach using a case study
   in obesity education.},

Abstract = {Explain Everything is an interactive, user-friendly, and easily
   accessible app for mobile devices. The interactive app-based teaching
   methods discussed here can be adopted in | any STEM or non-STEM course.
   This app allows instructors to take advantage of both the chalkboard and
   PowerPoint slides on a single platform, create videos for lecture
   captures and flipped/online classrooms, and virtually assist upper-level
   students with the development of soft skills through personalized
   videos/PDFs. Feedback data from students highlight multiple benefits
   from the use of this app. This app aids better visualization of
   concepts, promotes ubiquitous learning opportunities for students, and
   provides personalized feedback on documents in seminar courses.},

Title = {Enumeration of Potential Teaching Methods in Higher Education: A
   Cross-Disciplinary Study},
Journal = {EDUCATION RESEARCH INTERNATIONAL},
Year = {2020},
Volume = {2020},
Month = {OCT 14},
Abstract = {In today's multifaceted academic context, selecting, adopting, and
   adapting appropriate teaching methods (TMs) have been a pivotal concern
   for teachers. No study, to the researchers' knowledge, has been
   conducted on compiling the maximum number of TMs in higher education.
   This study aims to list, describe, and provide a platform of the
   potential and the most practicing TMs in four major educational
   disciplines. This article, taking a cross-disciplinary lens, conducts an
   in-depth review of 90 articles and enumerates 110 TMs of higher
   education. It also identifies several TMs that are commonly used in each
   discipline. The article concludes that knowledge generated from this
   study fills up the existing literature gap. It calls attention to the
   current TM practices and provides teachers with an outline to employ
   available TMs in their respective disciplines.},

Abstract = {The spread and threat of COVID-19 has brought the world under
   standstill. Educational institutions are not exempt. The pandemic has
   forced the universities to transform from traditional teaching-learning
   methods to web-based digital teaching-learning methods. Claims are being
   made that future teaching would be fully online rather than traditional
   or in-class mode. There are many challenges in implementation of online
   classes and at the same time there are possibilities to enhance the
   knowledge and resources required to build the global online education
   network. This paper reviews the challenges and possibilities in teaching
   and learning online, various technological tools and their outcome
   practiced by the academicians to conduct the lectures and assessment
   activities. A special attention has been paid to the impact COVID-19 on
   mental health and anxiety among the staff and student community.},

Abstract = {Background: As educational programs compete with online and open
   courseware, TED (Technology, Entertainment, and Design) Talks provide
   meaningful complementary content that can be easily integrated into
   curricula. Purpose: Evaluate an innovative approach to the standard
   lecture by combining media mixture with reflective writing. Methods:
   Undergraduate nursing students were asked to view a TED Talk and write a
   brief narrative reflection as part of their preparation for a
   communication class. Results: The video and reflective writing
   assignment were completed by 23/25 (92\%) of students. Qualitative
   analysis of the reflective writing identified three primary themes:
   Communication as a Foundational Competency, Importance of Empathy, and
   Professional Role Development. Conclusion: This illustrative talk and
   narrative exercise provided an interactive learning experience for
   novice nurses that served as a compelling means to critically reflect on
   effective health-care communication skills, prior to entry into
   practice.},

Abstract = {The main objective of this article is to promote a reflection about
   collaborative learning, having as motivation a lived experience in the
   teaching action, coming from the application of the inverted classroom
   in the subject of Knowledge Theory. Our reflection was guided by the
   following question: how to make students active, participative and
   responsible for their learning in the context in which teaching is
   philosophy? This article is structured in two parts. In the first one,
   we intend to make an approach on the aspects that characterize
   collaborative learning, as well as to explain the constituent elements
   of the inverted classroom methodology, as a strategy for the promotion
   of this type of learning. In the second, the intention is to reflect on
   the said experience related to the use of the inverted classroom
   methodology.},

Abstract = {Aim: This study determines the impact of traditional and interactive
   learning activities on personal and professional development among Saudi
   intern nurses.
   Design: A comparative research design was adopted by recruiting 48
   intern nurses, who were divided into two equal groups.
   Methods: Data were collected through the clinical assessment tool for
   nursing education.
   Results: Enthusiasm (p < .0001), initiative (p < .0001), realistic
   self-confidence (p < .0001), competent cooperation with staff (p <
   .0001) and competent cooperation with patients (p < .0001) were
   significantly higher among the interactive learning activity group
   compared with traditional group. The interactive learning activity
   showed better attitude of Saudi intern nurses in terms of caring,
   respect and sensitivity towards the needs and well-being of their
   patients, while considering personal factors.},

Abstract = {In the context of the coronavirus pandemic and of transferring
   face-to-face academic activities to online, we analyse several
   e-learning solutions in Geography university education, from the
   perspective of three components: e-communication, e-training, and
   e-assessment. The aim of this research is to investigate the use of
   photographs to enable learning of Geography during the educational
   process organized synchronously and asynchronously at Babes-Bolyai
   University, in Cluj-Napoca, Romania. After analyzing the online
   activities realized in the virtual classes on the Microsoft Teams
   platform, we identified, discussed, and represented schematically three
   instruction models, with their advantages and disadvantages, considering
   the Cognitive Theory of Multimedia Learning. The efficiency of these
   models depends on the features of the discipline and on professor's
   competence level in specialty and in didactic transposition.},

   innovative online flipped in-patient clerkship},
Journal = {INNOVATIONS IN EDUCATION AND TEACHING INTERNATIONAL},
Abstract = {In the context of the COVID-19 pandemic, innovative instructional design
   plays a crucial role to reach physically distanced students. This
   present study examined students' experience in an online flipped
   in-patient clerkship which was designed based on the 5E framework
   emphasising engagement, exploration, explanation, elaboration and
   evaluation phases. A survey and open-ended questions were employed to
   understand students' experience of the online flipped in-patient
   clerkship. The study found that in the pandemic situation, online
   flipped in-patient clerkship is an effective solution and their positive
   themes revolved around four main themes (i) effective and well-designed
   online content (ii) actual role of the pharmacist in in-patient
   clerkship (iii) communication (iv) visualising the actual situation.
   Based on the data, one model that would be able to facilitate and
   enhance the use of online flipped in-patient clerkship is suggested.},

Abstract = {The COVID-19 (COVID) pandemic affected nearly every aspect of higher
   education. It has been particularly disruptive to forest operations
   courses that rely heavily on field experiences. surveyed US forest
   operations instructors at four-year institutions granting SAF-accredited
   forestry degrees to understand how they rapidly modified courses during
   spring 2020 to accommodate a move to fully remote instruction. Through
   an online survey and interviews, a follow-up study was conducted to
   understand how courses were modified when instructors had time to
   prepare and what, if any, of those modifications are likely to be
   retained upon a return to in-person instruction. Two main themes emerged
   from the survey and interviews: instructors will expand the range of
   tools and methods used to convey course content, and they have a renewed
   respect for the importance of field experience and personal
   interactions.},

Abstract = {Background
   Research suggests flipped learning may improve student motivation to
   learn. Purpose
   This study examined motivation and learning strategies among
   prelicensure BSN students in a course taught using the flipped learning
   model. The hypothesis was that flipped learning may improve motivation
   and learning strategies of students. Methods
   A descriptive, comparative design examined motivation and learning
   strategies used by students in a flipped learning course. The Motivated
   Strategies for Learning Questionnaire and a demographic survey were
   administered to 25 BSN students at a Midwestern university. Results
   Substantial decreases were found from pretest to posttest mean scores
   for the task value, control of learning beliefs, and help seeking
   subscales. Conclusion
   The results did not support the hypothesis that flipped learning would
   improve motivation and learning strategies. Further research in larger
   diverse samples of students in a flipped learning course is recommended.},

Abstract = {The present study compares the structure, the longitudinal relation, and
   the predictive roles of emotions in-class and emotions while watching
   online video lectures outside of class. Participants (N = 269) reported
   their emotions, attentional control, and behavioral engagement
   associated with in-class activities and online lecture viewing at two
   time points in a large ``flipped{''} undergraduate anatomy course.
   Overall, the longitudinal and cross-contextual relations among emotions,
   from emotions to learning behaviors, and from emotions to achievement
   were similar, whereas distinct patterns of relations were found for
   learning behaviors, and from learning behaviors to academic achievement.
   These findings are discussed within the Control-Value Theory and provide
   implications for supporting adaptive emotions and learning in flipped
   classrooms.},

Abstract = {This article reports on the implementation of a programme of
   individualised, peer-graded homework assignments in a large-scale
   engineering course, with minimal resources. Participation in the
   programme allows students to receive grades for problem-solving work in
   a setting more conducive to learning than the traditional final
   examination. The homework programme was designed to support the ordinary
   course work and examination preparation of students along the semester,
   rather than an expansion of the curriculum. The implementation is
   carried out using a series of scripts on a local computer, for speed of
   deployment, portability and privacy protection. Data relevant to
   instructors are provided, showing that the programme integrates well
   within an existing grading system, at a relatively low time cost for the
   instructor, resulting in a relatively large enhancement in the students'
   learning experience.},

Title = {Shifting from Lecturing to Flipped Learning-Unpacking Lecturers'
   Implementation Considerations},
Journal = {NEW ZEALAND JOURNAL OF EDUCATIONAL STUDIES},
Abstract = {This study examines considerations that are required for successful
   implementation of flipped learning by tracing how lecturers in a
   university postgraduate dietetic programme designed and executed flipped
   learning across an academic year. Inductive analysis of lecturers'
   lesson design rationalisation, student learning artefacts and feedback
   was undertaken. The findings suggest that effective flipped learning
   implementation depends on how lecturers foster coherences within
   curriculum, learning activities, student engagement, and teaching. By
   establishing anchoring pedagogical goals as part of curriculum coherence
   lecturers create synergies among learning, teaching, and assessment.
   Positive student learning experiences are driven by student engagement
   that considers students' perceptions of workload, task complexity, and
   change to the learning culture. Strategies that manage pedagogical
   change and increased workload are also needed to create teaching
   coherence. Recommendations for improving flipped learning implementation
   in higher education contexts are discussed.},

Abstract = {Background: Faculty teaching a large class size implemented
   evidence-based teaching strategies (EBTS) to improve mastery of core
   concepts in an accelerated undergraduate pediatric nursing course.
   Method: Pre- and poststudent outcomes were analyzed using data from
   course assessments and American Technologies Institute (ATI) concept
   mastery testing to evaluate the effectiveness of course revisions. ATI
   designates three proficiency levels to determine mastery. A proficiency
   of level two exceeds the minimum expectations for mastery, whereas a
   proficiency level of three suggests students exceed NCLEX-RN standards
   of content. Results: Data indicated implementation of new EBTS
   facilitated improvement in student content mastery. Students exceeded
   the minimum expectations for NCLEX-RN standards of pediatric content.
   Course revisions resulted in all students achieving benchmark on ATI
   concept mastery testing with a three-fold increase in students achieving
   the highest level of proficiency. Conclusion: EBTS can be adapted for a
   large class size learning environment with improved learning outcomes.},

Abstract = {In flipped classrooms, students learn course content by watching flipped
   lessons (videos) outside of class time. During class, instructors guide
   learning by answering questions, facilitating projects, and fostering
   relationships with students. Although flipped classrooms are gaining
   popularity in secondary school settings, most research is performed with
   college-age samples. In this study, we compared two sections of a
   summer-based cognitive neuroscience course for academically talented
   youth: a flipped class and a class with traditional face-to-face
   instruction. Measures of academic achievement did not differ between the
   classes. The flipped class spent more time watching and re-watching
   lessons than the traditional class spent reading texts. Students rated
   organization, clarity, and enjoyment significantly higher in the
   traditional class. Despite these findings, the majority of students in
   both classes requested flipped lessons in the future. These results can
   inform how to flip classrooms for highly motivated secondary school
   students.},

Abstract = {The synchronous ``one-shot{''} information literacy workshop is arguably
   the most common teaching delivery method used by academic librarians.
   Challenges associated with this type of instruction largely revolve
   around repeating the same workshop. Other issues include accommodating
   and managing large numbers of students, scheduling conflicts, and
   workshop time constraints. One strategy to overcome some of these issues
   without hindering quality is to replace the traditional face-to-face
   approach with online videos. In this study, synchronous in-person
   instruction was compared to asynchronous instruction using video modules
   during a laboratory session and as a pre-lab assignment in a
   first-semester introductory biology majors' course. Students' responses
   to a survey revealed that online instructional videos have unique
   benefits and are effectively comparable to in-person instruction.},

Abstract = {This article seeks to problematize how the relationships established in
   the context of higher education can be seen as interactions capable of
   being analyzed under the perspective of complexity theory, which is
   quite latent in the 21st century, as shown in the works of
   Morin.Therefore, the classroom is, in fact, a kind of ``black box{''},in
   Chalot's terms, since it aggregates different elements that can be
   analyzed. The methodology of this research is of the case study type
   with a qualitative approach, since we are understanding the phenomena of
   interaction in a given classroom (YIN, 2005) from an interpretivist
   perspective of the corpus (BORTONI-RICARDO). It is pertinent to clarify
   that,at no time, we depreciate or refer to traditional teaching as
   something wrong. Although we understand its value, we believe that new
   times are emerging and, with this, new demands arise that need new
   teaching possibilities capable of being more effective.},

Abstract = {Learner-centered and learner-driven pedagogy have long been advocated by
   many educators and scholars who focus on sustainable education. This
   study proposes a pedagogical approach called collaborative learning by
   teaching (CLBT), which is both learner-centered and learner-driven. This
   study aims to explore and analyze the student perceptions of CLBT by
   conducting a field experiment in a Chinese public university. The
   quantitative results show that student perceptions were comprised of
   three dimensions: perceptions of CLBT, perceptions of teamwork, and
   perceptions of mobile learning. The male students had significantly more
   positive perceptions of CLBT and mobile learning compared to the female
   students. The qualitative findings indicate that although students have
   some difficulties with self-discipline, they gain much in active
   learning capabilities and teamwork skills. The relationship between CLBT
   and sustainability competence should be further studied in the future.},

Abstract = {AIM The aim of the study was to describe student and faculty experiences
   in the flipped learning environment.
   BACKGROUND Studies of flipped instruction in science, technology,
   engineering, and mathematics reveal improvements in student performance.
   There is limited research related to student and faculty experiences in
   the learning environment.
   METHOD This study utilized a multiple-case study research design with
   two undergraduate nursing courses at two institutions.
   RESULTS Student participants in Case A felt the implementation of
   flipped learning reflected the pillars of flipped learning more than
   Case B participants. The strategies used to implement flipped learning
   in the two cases were different as were student experiences.
   CONCLUSION Three conclusions resulted from the study: flipped learning
   results in a shift in the student role that requires additional
   instructor support, instructors would benefit from guidance in the form
   of best practices, and nurse educators can use flipped learning to
   better meet the learning needs of their students.},

Abstract = {Emergency medicine training programs face many challenges in creating
   and maintaining high quality didactic and asynchronous learning
   experiences. To address these challenges, our team created two tools.
   First, we designed the Emergency Medicine Curriculum Assessment Tool
   (EMCAT) to help program leaders compare their didactic program to the
   Model of Clinical Practice established by the American Board of
   Emergency Medicine (ABEM). Second, we created a catalog of free,
   open-access medical education (FOAMed) resources based on the ABEM Model
   subcategory. Residency leaders can use EMCAT to identify the
   underweighted topics in their conference program and then access the
   resource catalog to find educational content matched to their areas of
   increased need. To date, five programs have implemented EMCAT and users
   from over 72 countries have accessed nearly 1,000 resources. Both EMCAT
   and the resource catalog are available free online.},

Abstract = {The education sector is transforming from e-learning to m-learning due
   to its motivation capabilities that drive students toward self-motivated
   learning. However, this requires online participation through quality
   knowledge sharing (KS) of the social capital (SC) of resources.
   Past-reported low student participation calls for confirming whether
   social capital affects KS in m-learning. Scholars assessed this
   effect-however, not in the education sector-and revealed scant
   clarification of whether m-learning regulates SC through KS. Hence, this
   is the motivated aim reflected through a conceptual framework, that is,
   tested using multiple-regression analysis after collecting data from 334
   Ahlia University undergraduate business students. The results confirm
   that m-learning moderates students' SC through KS in e-/m-learning on
   Moodle. Implications for theory, practice, and society are revealed in
   this article.},

Abstract = {The transformation in the distance education system has led to the
   emergence of blended learning approaches that have necessitated
   effective support to facilitate students learning. This web survey aimed
   at determining the kinds of support available and accessible to distance
   education students of the University of Ghana. Data collected from 103
   Levels 300 and 400 students and findings from the survey indicated that
   physical and technological support services were frequently used among
   the respondents, whereas residential and e-library resources were the
   least subscribed support services among the students. In terms of social
   support services, interaction with tutors and interaction with fellow
   students came up as the main support services available to students
   while counselling services were absent for these students. It was
   recommended that the support services that were inadequate, least used,
   and absent should be provided to enable students to complete their
   programmes of study successfully.},

Abstract = {This study sought to understand the experiences of female 11th-graders
   in English classes that used Google Classroom applications during
   emergent e-learning due to COVID-19. Teachers and students used Google
   Classroom in place of face-to-face learning in Palestine as required by
   the Ministry of Education. A qualitative approach with semi-structured
   interviews was used to explore the experience of students using Google
   Classroom, with thematic analysis to analyze the data. Results indicated
   that most students were interested in using the Google Classroom
   application; however, the findings revealed that some students preferred
   face-to-face learning over the Google Classroom application because they
   suffered from Internet speed issues. The study suggests that in training
   teachers and students on how to use Google Classroom more effectively
   the Ministry of Education should play a vital role in encouraging both
   teachers and students to use this application for teaching purposes.},

Abstract = {Productive failure is a learning design that encompasses problem solving
   prior to instruction and the learning that occurs during and after this
   process. In the mathematics education literature, there is a need for
   analyses of students' interactions that occur as they collaborate during
   the productive failure process. In this paper, we contribute to this
   area by taking a closer look at students' interactions that characterize
   an effective productive failure process. In analyzing video footage of
   two different groups of students working on invention tasks in a flipped
   mathematics classroom, we observed that the productive failure process
   seemed to work best in groups of students among whom the instructional
   design evoked students' intellectual need and curiosity. These students
   also developed a set routine for solving problems whose solutions are
   difficult to find without prior direct instruction on the topic, which
   proved valuable on follow-up in-class and posttest problems.},

Abstract = {In this work, through integrate that teaching management system, the
   learn mode of the O2O is used to build a learner-centered frame of the
   teaching reformation. This frame is supported by the O2O learning
   platform, with themed practical teaching and O2O model as the main body,
   and the Thousand questions plan and Teachers guiding system as two
   guarantee supports. In order to achieve high quality results, specific
   implementation plan, including management system and implementation
   measures has been formulated in teaching reform of O2O platform. The
   questionnaire shows that this system has mobilized the enthusiasm of
   teachers and students. By comparing the practice results of the
   experimental class and the control class, the effectiveness of the O2O
   teaching framework is verified, and the teaching reform is successful.
   Finally, this paper provides teaching inspiration and future research
   direction for educators and researchers.},

Abstract = {The small private online course (SPOC) of Principles of Chemical
   Engineering for the majors of Chemistry, Material, Environment,
   Pharmaceutical Sciences, etc., has been constructed by the teaching team
   of chemical engineering in Zhejiang Normal University. We recorded 101
   micro-videos of knowledge points, which explained in detail the fluid
   flow, fluid transportation machinery, heat transfer as well as
   distillation and absorption; and briefly interpreted the operations
   involving particulate solids, mass transfer equipments, evaporation,
   extraction, and drying of solids. The SPOC course has been online and
   run for 2 years on Zhejiang Institutions of Higher Learning Online Open
   Course Sharing Platform. Our teaching practices show that the
   online/offline blended learning combines the students' online self-study
   through micro-videos before class with traditional classroom, and
   greatly improves the learning efficiency. Meanwhile, the blended
   learning based on the online courses shares the high-quality courses and
   will be the future trend in higher education.},

Abstract = {The study examines the impact of flipped classrooms (FC) in enhancing
   postgraduate students' research skills in preparing a research proposal
   (RP). Postgraduate students in the College of Education at King Saud
   University were enrolled in a special course called `Independent Study'
   that specialises in helping students prepare an RP. A class of eight
   students were taught this course using the FC strategy. The students
   took a test in research skills both before and after the course, and
   were administered a questionnaire to understand their attitude towards
   the FC strategy. It was found that students' relevant research skills
   improved between the pre-test and post-test, indicating that the FC was
   an appropriate teaching strategy. Theoretically, the study supports the
   FC strategy by highlighting its role in enhancing students' learning and
   in helping students overcome obstacles faced during their work preparing
   an RP, such as getting enough practice, teacher supervision, and
   feedback.},

Abstract = {Multimedia in blended learning provides the ability to enhance students'
   performance and satisfaction. Microlectures are one type of multimedia
   that comprise of short modular videos that introduce basic theoretical
   concepts. Literature provides limited insight into how this specific
   format supports engineering classrooms. This study, therefore, explored
   what the benefit of flipped microlecture classes is for students in a
   course with mainly traditional face-to-face lectures. To this end, we
   allocated ten students to a flipped microlecture and twelve to a
   traditional lecture setting; conducted pre and post-tests; and,
   organised a focus group. Results show a positive effect of the flipped
   microlecture class on the test performance. Students' qualitative
   evaluations also indicate their satisfaction with increased control over
   learning, reduced discomfort of traditional lecture settings, enhanced
   classroom interaction, and better knowledge retention. These findings
   resonate with blended learning and multimedia literature and support
   future decision making about microlectures in engineering education.},

Abstract = {This paper presents a systematic review of the literature on flipped
   language classrooms from the perspectives of theoretical foundations,
   learning activities, tools, research topics and findings based on an
   analysis of 34 published articles. The results indicate that various
   research methods (e.g., tests, surveys, and interviews) were applied in
   the selected studies and different types of e-tools (e.g.,
   video-watching tools, online learning platforms, online discussion
   tools, and video-making tools) were used in the flipped language
   classrooms. The findings also reveal that the flipped language classroom
   not only improved students' academic performance and cultivated their
   learning motivation but also developed their self-regulation,
   confidence, and higher-order thinking skills. Other research topics in
   the reviewed articles included the effects of external and learner
   factors on the flipped learning approach, students' readiness and
   technology acceptance, the flipped learning process, students'
   interactions, and teacher perceptions.},

Abstract = {Objective. To review the types of pre-class learning modalities used in
   flipped classrooms (FC) and team-based learning (TBL) and determine best
   practices.
   Findings. Forty-eight articles were included. Reading materials or video
   lectures were used most often as the primary modality to deliver the
   pre-class learning. Students favored assignments that have clear
   objectives, provide guidance, are guided, and are brief.
   Summary. This study describes how pharmacy schools and colleges are
   implementing FC into their curricula and the types of pre-class learning
   that are being developed and assigned with the implementation. More
   research should be done in comparing the impact of different types of
   pre-class material on learning outcomes, such as knowledge retention.
   This is especially important in FC settings because the in-class
   learning and higher order activities are built upon having a good
   foundational knowledge, which comes from the pre-class learning.},

Abstract = {Context.-Pathology education must evolve as medical knowledge expands
   and disruptive technologies emerge. The evolution in pathology teaching
   practices accelerated as traditional teaching modalities were suspended
   in March 2020 during the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic.
   Objectives.-To provide pathologists an overview of established teaching
   paradigms and practical examples of how these paradigms may be applied
   to pathology education, emphasizing differences in graduate and
   undergraduate medical education as well as the challenges and promises
   of remote learning, as revealed by the COVID-19 pandemic.
   Data Sources.-Selected peer-reviewed publications representing the field
   of educational social science.
   Conclusions.-Evidence-based methods described in education and social
   sciences can be effectively deployed in pathology education and
   especially remote learning, as necessitated by the current COVID-19
   pandemic. Understanding established principles, such as cognitive load,
   competency-based learning, peer-assisted learning, and flipped
   classrooms may prove useful in developing effective, learner-centric
   content for pathology education.},

Abstract = {Teaching strategic management well involves instilling in students a
   lifelong process of improving critical thinking that can lead them to
   sound judgments (i.e., wisdom) concerning strategic issues. This
   activity is devilishly difficult, yet profoundly rewarding. The
   difficulties come from our still-new and emerging discipline, from
   change and uncertainty in the business world, and from various
   institutional factors. The rewards arise during the process of pursuing
   a worthy goal with one's students. This essay outlines a
   process-involving teaching tools such as ``flipping{''} the classroom,
   examining past and current strategy narratives, evidence-based
   management, and case studies- aimed toward ``nudging{''} strategy
   students onto a continuing path of improving their critical thinking. No
   summit exists that, once reached, represents goal achievement for
   professors or for students. Instead, profound satisfaction can result
   simply from deep engagement in the process of becoming more complete
   teachers and learners of strategic management.},

Title = {Investigating the self-study phase of an inverted biochemistry classroom
   - collaborative dyadic learning makes the difference},
Journal = {BMC MEDICAL EDUCATION},
Year = {2019},
Volume = {19},
Month = {FEB 28},
Abstract = {BackgroundThe inverted classroom approach is characterized by a primary
   self-study phase for students followed by an on-site, face-to-face
   teaching phase that is used to deepen the prior acquired knowledge.
   Obviously, this teaching approach relies on the students preparing
   before the on-site phase, which in turn requires optimized preparatory
   material as well as defined working instructions. The major aim of this
   study, therefore, was to investigate the effect of different preparatory
   materials and working instructions for the self-study phase of an
   e-learning-based inverted classroom on the knowledge gained by medical
   students in biochemistry. Furthermore, we analyzed whether collaborative
   dyadic learning during the self-study phase is more effective than
   individual learning with respect to knowledge gain.MethodsThe study was
   performed in a biochemistry seminar for second semester medical students
   at Ulm University in Germany. This seminar was held using an
   e-learning-based inverted classroom. A total of 196 students were
   divided into three homogeneous study groups that differed in terms of
   the working material and instructions provided for the self-study phase.
   Knowledge gain was measured by formative tests at the beginning of the
   on-site phases. Questionnaires were also handed out asking about
   motivation, interest and learning time in the self-study
   phases.ResultsStudents who were told to prepare in collaborating dyads
   during the self-study phase performed better in formative tests taken at
   the beginning of on-site phases than learners who were told to prepare
   individually. The study material that was provided was of minor
   importance for the differences in formative testing since almost all
   students prepared for the on-site phases. With the dyadic learning
   approach, both students benefited from this collaboration, characterized
   by a higher motivation and interest in the topic, as well as a longer
   time spent on task.ConclusionOur study provides strong evidence that the
   study material, but more importantly the instructions provided for the
   self-study phase, affect students` knowledge gain in an e-learning-based
   inverted classroom. The instructed collaboratively working group was the
   most successful.},

Title = {A systematic review study on educational robotics and robots},
Journal = {INTERACTIVE LEARNING ENVIRONMENTS},
Abstract = {This study, which systematically examines educational robotics and
   robots (ERR), has two purposes. (1) Classifying the research on the ERR
   to identify research trends and gaps, (2) Summarizing the experimental
   findings related to ERR and to interpret them according to the claims in
   the literature. A mixed method combining systematic mapping and
   systematic review were used in the study. Ninety-three articles
   published in Social Sciences Citation Index (SSCI) indexed journals and
   meeting the specified criteria were analyzed using a systematic mapping
   process. The results showed that 40 out of 93 articles did not include
   any learning theory. Thirty-two experimental studies were analyzed
   within the scope of the systematic review. The empirical findings
   supporting some of the claims about ERR are summarized and the research
   gaps in the claims that need to be supported by theoretical and
   pedagogical approaches are revealed.},

Abstract = {Studies consistently show that active learning improves student
   satisfaction, but results on achievement are less conclusive. We address
   this puzzle by comparing an active learning classroom that employs peer
   instruction with a traditional lecture using an experimental design in a
   Chilean Economics and Business school. Students in the treatment group
   are more satisfied with the course and have better grades, but the
   treatment effect varies as the semester progresses: small at the
   beginning, larger in the middle, and nonexistent in the final exam. Our
   hypothesis is that the treatment changed student effort. Students
   performed better under peer instruction and may have decided to decrease
   their effort toward the end of the semester. We present evidence
   consistent with this hypothesis. Additionally, students in the treatment
   group perceived that the most important part of the treatment was the
   greater interaction with the professor, and they reported studying less
   with their peers outside of class.},

Journal = {INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF MOBILE AND BLENDED LEARNING},
Year = {2020},
Volume = {12},

Month = {JAN-MAR},
Abstract = {Project-based learning (PBL) and Blended Learning (BL) have been widely
   used in universities. There are some empirical teaching researches on
   PBL in the BL environment for some specific courses, but for the
   combination of PBL and BL, there is as yet no universal teaching model.
   This article puts forward a new universal teaching mode: Project-Based
   Blended Learning (PBBL) and describes a teaching experiment in applying
   PBBL. Firstly, the design idea of PBBL is discussed. Secondly, taking a
   course on Single Chip Microcomputers (SCM) as an example, the strategies
   of selecting, designing and controlling the core teaching elements are
   given, and the complete implementation plan and concrete methods are
   described. The teaching case shows that the PBBL gives full play to the
   advantages of BL and PBL, and can effectively improve students'
   abilities of self-learning, practical application and innovation.},

Abstract = {Based upon the self-regulated learning theory, this study examined the
   relationships between academic achievement and three key self-regulatory
   constructs - prior domain knowledge, self-efficacy, and the use of
   learning strategies - in two flipped undergraduate math courses.
   Structural equation modeling was employed as the primary method to
   analyze the relationships in both the pre-class and in-class learning
   environments of the flipped courses. The results of the study showed
   that students' self-efficacy in learning math and the use of help
   seeking strategies were all significantly positively related with
   academic achievement in both pre- and in-class learning environments. In
   addition, students' self-efficacy in collaborative learning had a
   positive impact on their use of help seeking strategies during in-class
   learning. The theoretical and instructional implications are discussed.},

Abstract = {This research aims to investigate the perception of English as a Foreign
   Language (EFL) learners on cooperative experiential learning in a
   flipped translation classroom. Translation competence is seen as one of
   the essential language skills to acquire for English. In order to
   facilitate learners in developing translation skills, a learner-centered
   instruction integrating cooperative learning with experiential learning
   was implemented. A total of 13 English majors taking a required
   translation course at a university in Taiwan participated in the
   research. Data were collected from semi-structured interviews and
   analyzed systematically using a qualitative conductive approach. Results
   showed that the participants encountered different obstacles when
   translating from English to Chinese and vice versa. The findings
   indicated that this flipped translation classroom enables learners to
   actively engage in the translation process and elevate the learning
   process from lower order thinking to higher order thinking Pedagogical
   implications are suggested and research implications are also provided
   for future studies.},

Abstract = {In this paper we develop knowledge of the discourse that takes place
   between teacher and students in two large undergraduate classes which
   use a flipped, active learning approach. In flipped classes students
   encounter the content through pre-class resources, freeing up class time
   for more active engagement with the material. This results in increased
   opportunities for teacher-student interactions which may be beneficial
   for learning. Our aim here is to explore the nature and purposes of
   these dialogues. Two case studies from introductory physics classes at
   the University of Edinburgh are analysed through a sociocultural
   perspective. Three main purposes of dialogues are observed: (1)
   Involving students in sense-making, (2) Guided expert modelling and (3)
   Wonderment questions. We found that the dialogues predominantly use a
   triadic Initiation, Response, Feedback (IRF) format and are
   authoritative in nature, but work together to create an interactive
   learning environment that can be described as `ideologically dialogic'},

Abstract = {Merrill's first principles of instruction (FPI) are considered as
   fundamental principles for improving instructional effectiveness
   regardless of context, approach, or audience. However, very little
   research explores in detail the process of implementing FPI in course
   design. In this case study, we provide specific descriptions of how we
   applied Merrill's FPI in an online course redesign project. Using the
   rapid prototyping approach, we analyzed the needs of the redesign
   project, developed the project objectives and plans, and conducted a
   parallel processes of design, development, and implementation of the new
   course features. Thirteen redesign tasks were identified, prioritized,
   and completed to enhance the application of FPI. Students indicated in
   the course evaluation forms that the redesigned course presented the
   connections between theories and practice more effectively. We discus
   this study's implications for the application of FPI and the rapid
   prototyping model and make suggestions for future research.},

Abstract = {COVID-19 has flipped traditional face-to-face exchanges. This quickly
   prompted involuntary changes that required appropriate pedagogical
   strategies suited to online courses. This study explored the
   experiences, interactions, and social presence (SP) of participants
   involved in the 2020 spring term postgraduate program in a Taiwanese
   university. Through the interviews with instructors and students, SP was
   analyzed in terms of affective association, community cohesion,
   instructor involvement, and interaction intensity. Results showed that
   SP was perceived favorably by students while teachers have attempted to
   enhance the learning environment by augmenting the SP indicators. This
   study advances the understanding that despite having low perceptions on
   community cohesiveness and interaction intensity, there is some emerging
   evidence to suggest that SP has been observed by learners even under the
   pressures and limitations imposed by COVID-19 on HEIs. Theoretical and
   practical contributions are provided to assist universities navigating
   their way out of COVID-19.},

Title = {On Natural Variation in Grades in Higher Education, and Its Implications
   for Assessing Effectiveness of Educational Innovations},
Journal = {EDUCATIONAL MEASUREMENT-ISSUES AND PRACTICE},
Abstract = {To investigate the effect of innovations in the teaching-learning
   environment, researchers often compare study results from different
   cohorts across years. However, variance in scores can be attributed to
   both random fluctuation and systematic changes due to the innovation,
   complicating cohort comparisons. In the present study, we illustrate how
   using information about the variation in course grades over time can
   help researchers and practitioners better compare the grades and pass
   rates of different cohorts of students. To this end, all 375,093 grades
   from all 40,087 first-year students at a Dutch university during a
   period of six consecutive years were examined. Overall, about 17\% of
   the variation in grades could be attributed to random variation between
   years and courses. With respect to passing courses, this percentage was
   almost 40\%. Nonsignificant improvements in grades could be flagged as
   highly significant when this is ignored, thus leading to an
   overrepresentation of significant effects in educational literature. As
   a consequence, too many educational innovations are claimed to be
   effective.},

Title = {Learning analytics based feedback and recommendations in flipped
   classrooms: an experimental study in higher education},
Journal = {JOURNAL OF RESEARCH ON TECHNOLOGY IN EDUCATION},
Abstract = {This mixed-method pretest/post-test experimental study examined the
   effect of learning analytics (LA)-based interventions on students'
   academic achievement and self-regulatory skills, and explored students'
   perceptions of such interventions in flipped classrooms (FC). Sixty-two
   college students from an introductory computer course were randomly
   assigned to the experimental or control group, with 31 participants in
   each condition. In the following 10 weeks, LA-based personalized
   interventions, including both visual feedback and written
   recommendations were provided to those in the experimental group on a
   weekly basis. Quantitative analyses found significant improvements in
   students' academic achievement as well as their self-regulated learning
   skills in the treatment group. Consistently, students' comments and
   feedback confirmed that LA-based interventions were effective in
   promoting self-regulated learning in FC. The researchers discuss both
   practical and research implications in FC and in online learning,
   provide recommendations for the design and advancement of LA-based
   interventions, and suggest future directions for LA research in higher
   education.},

Abstract = {This study compares performance and perception of students in a
   management course at a business school in the Middle East. 122 students
   completed an Introduction to Management course, which was divided into
   three different delivery modes, namely traditional, online and flipped.
   The results of the study reveal several interesting findings. Both the
   online and flipped sections performed better than the traditional one
   and the flipped section performed better than the online one.
   Absenteeism was higher in the traditional mode compared to the flipped
   mode. Furthermore, accessing online material improved performance in the
   online and flipped modes; students who accessed the online material
   missed fewer classes in the flipped mode; and 52\% of the students (of
   whom 58\% were high performers) believe the flipped mode is more helpful
   than the traditional mode. Implications of the study and avenues for
   future research are discussed.},

Abstract = {This article presents an experiment with a group of secondary school
   music students in Spain. We used music score sheets enriched with Quick
   Response codes as a resource for the practice required to play a musical
   instrument. The first group (n = 56) was compared with another group (n
   = 56) that used traditional resources (textbooks and compact discs). The
   results of the research supported the fact that the students who used QR
   codes associated with videos - read by using mobile devices such as
   smartphones or tablets - achieved better results than those who used
   more traditional resources. The analysis of variance test showed that
   the learning resource had a significant effect on the scores obtained by
   the students. In other words, the marks of the students participating in
   the study varied significantly according to the resource used. There was
   no significant effect on the interaction of method and gender, so there
   is no relation between the students' gender and the resources' impact on
   the results obtained by students.},

Title = {The link between flipped and active learning: a scoping review},
Journal = {TEACHING IN HIGHER EDUCATION},
Abstract = {Flipped learning in higher education is becoming increasingly
   widespread. Although the number of flipped learning articles has
   increased since 2011, systematic reviews of flipped learning have been
   criticized for lacking a theoretical framework. The aim in this article
   is to explore the link between flipped learning and active learning:
   specifically, which theoretical frameworks are described. A scoping
   review was adopted as the research methodology. The selected studies
   indicate that this link between flipped learning and active learning is
   rarely explicitly addressed or operationalized. Approximately 65\% of
   the 435 full-text articles retrieved do not explicitly connect their
   research to theory or a conceptual framework. The remaining 155 studies
   included for analysis refer to a mix of pedagogical terms or approaches.
   The theoretical and conceptual underpinnings are generally only vaguely
   described, with a few exceptions. The results indicate an eclecticism
   and a reluctance to connect flipped learning with a specific conceptual
   framework.},

Abstract = {The distance teaching of organic chemistry to first-year undergraduate
   students during lockdown represents a challenge for both students and
   teachers. To face this challenge, a method combining synchronous and
   asynchronous teaching was presented in this paper. The asynchronous part
   of the teaching was achieved through the broadcast of videos on the
   social network Facebook in order to allow each student to progress at
   his or her own pace. The synchronous part of the teaching was carried
   out thanks to the Discord platform in order to answer students questions
   live (written and oral) as well as to keep a social link with them. The
   videos have been recorded at home with a minimum amount of material, and
   the equipment is reported. To assess the efficiency of this alternative
   teaching compared to distance real-time teaching during disruption, a
   questionnaire completed by students was used and discussed.},

Abstract = {This article describes how the advent of the Information Age has brought
   an educational tendency to focus on the quality and morality, excluding
   the quantity of education and rote learning. This highlights the
   importance of developing competence of critical insight, problem
   solving, collaboration, communication, creative thinking, and cultural
   understanding in public education. However, the reality of education in
   Korea is that the public school fails to be apart from content-based
   learning, teacher-centered learning and ranking-oriented learning. To
   solve this problem, the Education Ministry suggests cultivating a
   creative human resource with integrated competency in the revised
   curriculum of 2015 and implement a free semester program. Moreover,
   flipped learning is being realized and researched as the shift the
   teaching paradigm, aiming to introduce it in each school. Accordingly,
   this project suggests establishing a step in the right direction of
   flipped learning so that it can be boosted on stage. This article also
   suggests the purpose and its goal of flipped learning based on precedent
   studies and their implications on political, administrative and
   financial, cultural, school curriculum and assessment-based view.},

   Providers across various medical specialties and allied health

   reimbursement, and lack of clinical experience in counseling patients
   are often cited as obstacles. This article will address these issues and
   demonstrate how LM can be successfully practiced in a standard primary
   care setting. Active participation in the local community is essential.
   Office visits must be prepared for efficiently, and encounters should
   focus on teaching simple concepts to patients. At-home learning
   activities can then be used to build on these concepts. Referral to
   health coaches and outside programs are helpful options as well.
   Equipping providers with practice tools to promote lifestyle change will
   improve satisfaction for patients and providers alike and is an

Abstract = {European Higher Education Area includes standards for graduate and

   learning strategies of students in occupational medicine, from the
   teachers point of view, deals fundamentally with improving learning

   learning strategies in occupational medicine teaching modules. A sample
   with 53 undergraduate students who were enrolled in occupational health
   classes participate in the study. The students filled the Study Process
   Questionnaire (R-SPQ-2F). Strategies used by students were related with
   the learning assessment performed at the end of the teaching term.
   Students expressed a significantly higher use of deep strategies (16 +/-
   4) than surface strategies (14 +/- 2). Regarding performance, there was
   a direct relationship between deep strategies score and the learning
   assessment results. The findings support that, in occupational medicine,
   knowledge of learning strategies profiles will help to improve
   education. In order to improve teaching standards it is advisable
   applying assessment systems that allow adapting teaching methods to

Abstract = {There is a critical need to evaluate pedagogical delivery platforms best
   suited for undergraduates in the information age. Our goal was to
   identify the optimum course delivery platform for a basic research
   course based on student performance and critical thinking scores.
   Students were expected to plan, conduct, and report on an animal
   behavior research project of their own design. The course was taught in
   three different formats: traditional, online, and flipped, over 2 yr by
   the same instructor at both the University of Florida and Santa Fe
   College. Student assessments included weekly quizzes, assignments, a
   written report, a poster presentation, and attendance. We conducted pre-
   and postassessments using the Cornell Critical Thinking Test (CCTT).
   Students' grades differed depending on format delivery and were also
   different between University of Florida and Santa Fe College students.
   For students at the University of Florida, quiz grades and poster grades
   did not differ (P < 0.50) between formats. However, assignment grades (P
   = 0.04) and report grades (P < 0.001) differed by format and were higher
   in the flipped and online-only version of the course, compared with
   traditional. For students at the Santa Fe College, quiz grades (P =
   0.71) did not differ, but assignment (P < 0.001), report (P = 0.003),
   and poster (P < 0.001) grades were higher in the flipped and traditional
   format of the course. Within the flipped format at the University of
   Florida, student CCTT scores increased (P < 0.001) between pre- and
   posttest, whereas the scores within the other formats did not differ.
   When we compared the magnitude of change between pre- and posttest
   scores across formats, students at the University of Florida in the
   flipped format tended (P = 0.060) to have a greater gain than students
   in the online format. For students at Santa Fe College, there was no
   difference between pre- and posttest CCTT scores for any format, and the
   magnitude of change in scores did not differ between formats. Overall,
   our results suggest that teaching format influences student grades and
   critical thinking scores. Different effects were seen in different
   student populations; however, positive effects of the flipped format on
   student grades were seen at both institutions. In conclusion, flipped
   format courses may improve learning and critical thinking in an early
   research-based course.},

Abstract = {Innovative teaching methodologies begat blended learning, which seems to
   facilitate engineering students' achievement of competencies required
   for the 21st century and has proven to be essential to keep quality
   standards as university education has suffered the COVID-19 pandemic. In
   this paper, we approach the use of b-learning and digital technologies
   before the pandemic started, and how it worked like a vaccine, enabling
   university education resilience and facilitating the sustainability of
   the students learning process. A questionnaire-based study is presented,
   in which the data came from Aerospace Engineering students following a
   Mathematics subject in a Technological University in Spain. ANOVA and
   ANCOVA analysis provided a significant difference in the appreciation of
   the adaptation based on the prior application of b-learning
   methodologies or more traditional methodologies. Results obtained
   indicated that the use of digital resources and educational platforms
   caused a noticeable change in the students' way of learning, improving
   habits and digital skills.},

Abstract = {Online video-recorded lectures have become an increasingly more
   important means for student learning (e.g., in flipped classrooms).
   However, getting students to process these lectures sufficiently to come
   to class well-prepared is a challenge for educators. This paper
   investigates the effectiveness of open-ended embedded questions for
   accomplishing that. An experiment compared a video-recorded lecture
   presented online with and without such questions. No feedback was given
   on responses to the questions. University students (N = 40) viewed the
   lecture, responded to a questionnaire on self-efficacy and usability,
   and completed a knowledge test. User logs revealed that the students
   engaged significantly more with the embedded questions lecture.
   Engagement was not related to knowledge test results, however. Uniformly
   high appraisals were given for self-efficacy, usefulness, ease of use
   and satisfaction. Mean test scores were significantly higher for the
   embedded questions condition. It is concluded that open-ended embedded
   questions without feedback can increase the effectiveness of online
   video-recorded lectures as learning resources.},

Abstract = {The idea of clustering students according to their online learning
   behavior has the potential of providing more adaptive scaffolding by the
   intelligent tutoring system itself or by a human teacher. With the aim
   of identifying student groups who would benefit from the same
   intervention in AC-ware Tutor, this research examined online learning
   behavior using 8 tracking variables: the total number of content pages
   seen in the learning process; the total number of concepts; the total
   online score; the total time spent online; the total number of logins;
   the stereotype after the initial test, the final stereotype, and the
   mean stereotype variability. The previous measures were used in a
   four-step analysis that consisted of data preprocessing, dimensionality
   reduction, the clustering, and the analysis of a posttest performance on
   a content proficiency exam. The results were also used to construct the
   decision tree in order to get a human-readable description of student
   clusters.},

Abstract = {This paper shows the application of an innovate pedagogical approach
   based on the project-based learning technique, focused on the training
   of communication skills in the framework of a workshop of innovation in
   chemical engineering. Written, graphical verbal, and non-verbal
   communication were tackled. For that purpose, a project of technological
   innovation was developed by the students in teams within the specific
   area of chemical engineering. A professional-like environment was
   simulated by a final workshop where the students defenced and supported
   their project by using oral presentation and production of a poster and
   a video. Several surveys were performed before and after the project
   application. The final survey revealed that both students and lecturers
   perceived an improvement on the communication skills of the students.
   Moreover, both lecturers and students declared satisfaction with the
   methodology, recommending its application in other disciplines. (C) 2018

Abstract = {Student-generated questioning (SGQ) has been widely used to facilitate
   English learning in the Foreign Language classroom, with questions
   surrounding its quality and use in flipped classrooms remaining at the
   forefront of discussions. This study aims to explore the implications of
   integrating SGQ using a game-based learning platform named Kahoot, on
   students' English performance in flipped classrooms. Participants were
   77 university students and sub-divided into an experimental group
   labelled SGQ\_FL and a control group determined by teacher-generated
   questioning (TGQ), labelled TGQ\_FL. The results suggest that SGQ is
   effective in enhancing students' English performance. No significant
   difference was found in the mental load between groups, yet SGQ induced
   a higher mental effort than TGQ. These results reflected that greater
   effort was required to formulate and answer questions compared with only
   answering them. Further research incorporating SGQ strategy in a
   game-based learning platform shows promise for fostering students'
   English performance.},

Abstract = {Contribution: This paper illustrates how to design and implement
   curricula in terms of the combined use of flipped learning and
   inquiry-based learning in an engineering course.
   Background: Elementary courses in engineering schools are conventional
   and foundational, and involve a considerable amount of knowledge.
   Throughout such courses, students are also expected to develop insight,
   which cannot be obtained by only listening to instructors. Having
   relevant discussions is also difficult for most instructors.
   Intended Outcomes: The combined use of flipped learning and
   inquiry-based learning would be beneficial to broaden student
   achievement.
   Application Design: Based on an epistemological approach about knowledge
   and knowing, this paper applies the combined use of flipped learning and
   inquiry-based learning to enhance student knowledge and advance ways of
   thinking on a System Modeling and Control course.
   Findings: The extended learning time and the collective responsibility
   for learning are discussed as critical issues in applying the combined
   use of flipped learning and inquiry-based learning in an engineering
   school.},

Abstract = {At the start of the new century, teaching was transformed by the new
   communication technologies. Teaching-learning models, mediated through
   computers, have catalyzed new ways of teaching and learning beyond
   spatial and temporal coordinates. E-learning, blended learning and
   mobile learning offer a new universe of interactivity for teaching
   purposes. This work reviews the state of research studies and scientific
   literature on the new reality created by blended learning, analyzing its
   conceptualizations in the main scientific databases, with more than 7000
   entries in Web of Sciences and almost 95000 in Google Scholar. The
   outcomes of this work show the strong momentum of good practices and the
   subsequent research in all the areas and levels of education,
   transversal competencies, teaching methods, educational materials and
   technologies. The main conclusion is that new ways of teaching and
   learning should be studied and understood regarding their connections
   with new learning media and contexts, starting from the incursion of the
   blended learning revolution.},

Abstract = {Despite the worldwide popularity of flipped learning, we understand
   little about how to coherently structure a flipped class with
   appropriate communication services to engage students. This two-stage
   study examines in flipped learning context, how students perceived
   learning guided by the 5E design model
   (engagement-exploration-explanation-elaboration-evaluation), and how
   different technologies impacted the learning experience. We first
   reported a multiple-case study on how students felt about the 5E
   model-based flipped learning, facilitated by mobile instant messaging
   (MIM) tools. We then conducted a comparative study to investigate how
   students felt about using either MIM or a threaded asynchronous forum
   for discussion. The results suggested that 92\% of participants found
   flipped learning more engaging and 81\% reported that flipped learning
   gave them more time to discuss or solve problems. Most students welcomed
   using MIM for flipped learning, but online forum was still preferred for
   academic discussions. Possible reasons and suggestions for future
   research are discussed.},

Abstract = {Purpose: The authors implemented an active learning teaching strategy in
   a coaching education course utilizing a modified team-based learning
   (TBL) approach. assessing the learning benefits and satisfaction of
   students' experience. Method: After reviewing preparatory background
   materials, 35 students responded in-class to prompts in developing
   coaching action plans. Students completed two in-class learning
   activities: one on their own (Solo) and one as a group (TBL). The
   authors examined student performance on exam transfer questions for the
   two activities. Later, students reported on their satisfaction with the
   learning activities. Results: Students performed better on exam transfer
   questions related to their TBL and Solo conditions (p < .003. d = 0.75).
   Students reported a preference for working in teams compared with
   working on their own in developing case studies (p <.06, d = 0.63).
   Discussion/Conclusion: Results highlight the benefits of TBL in a
   coaching education classroom emphasizing how preparation, collaboration,
   and applied learning activities impact student learning outcomes.},

Abstract = {The purpose of the present study was to examine if and how the
   introduction of a flipped learning (FL) framework in Norwegian lower and
   upper secondary school physical education (PE) could affect student
   situational motivation and health-related fitness knowledge (HRFK). 206
   Norwegian students (48\% girls) from secondary and upper secondary
   schools were included in a three-week-long intervention. 85 students
   were assigned to an intervention group and 121 students to a control
   group, with the intervention aimed at integrating information
   communication technology (ICT) through the use of online videos. The
   results showed a negative motivational change for male students unless
   the activity changes were placed within an explanatory rationale through
   FL. The application of FL caused more cognitive knowledge learning,
   resulting in higher levels of HRFK among both girls and boys. The
   current research provided valuable insights into Norwegian students'
   motivation for PE and that cognitive knowledge learning can be affected
   when integrating the use of ICT in PE.},

Abstract = {The global pandemic of COVID-19 has forced educational provision to
   suddenly shift to a digital environment all around the globe. During
   these extraordinary times of teaching and learning both the challenges
   and the opportunities of embedding technologically enhanced education
   permanently became evident. Even though reinforced by constraints due to
   the pandemic, teaching through digital tools increases the portfolio of
   approaches to reach learning outcomes in general. In order to reap the
   full benefits, this Minireview displays various initiatives and tools
   for distance education in the area of Synthetic Biology in higher
   education while taking into account specific constraints of teaching
   Synthetic Biology from a distance, such as collaboration, laboratory and
   practical experiences. The displayed teaching resources can benefit
   current and future educators and raise awareness about a diversified
   inventory of teaching formats as a starting point to reflect upon one's
   own teaching and its further advancement.
   In this Minireview, a summary of different tools and ressources for
   digitally enhanced and distance teaching of Synthetic Biology is
   provided, ranging from virtual mobility over MOOCs to gamification.},

Abstract = {The GoKoan e-learning platform supports face-to-face training in an
   educational community. Its aim is to optimise the way and the time of
   study in order to improve academic performance. To evaluate the GoKoan
   platform's effectiveness as a tool for improving academic performance,
   an experimental study was carried out using a sample of 171 university
   students enrolled in the psychology degree programme who were randomly
   assigned to the two different conditions (the experimental group:
   traditional learning + e-learning with the GoKoan platform; and the
   control group: traditional learning without e-learning). The findings
   showed that using GoKoan had a positive impact on the students' academic
   performance (d = 0.39, 95 \% CI {[}0.08, 0.69]). The results highlight
   the importance of blended learning in improving students' learning
   performance. Other aspects of its effectiveness (e.g, the levels
   achieved in student learning outcomes) will be considered in future
   studies.},

Abstract = {Research on interactive learning space classrooms has reported that
   instructors and students find them engaging, and engagement is expected
   to increase learning outcomes. Positive findings about interactive
   classrooms, though, are often confounded with active learning pedagogy
   since instructors who teach in interactive classrooms tend to also
   promote active learning pedagogy. More research is needed to tease apart
   learning gains from the instructional design, classroom context, and the
   related incorporation of technology. This study examined the
   relationship between learning gains and classroom context (traditional
   and interactive learning space) in a pretest/posttest design and
   reviewed student survey responses about learning experiences.
   Participants were enrolled in one of two sections of a course. Both
   groups were taught by the same instructor using active learning pedagogy
   with the same activities, materials, and assignments. The results showed
   that classroom context did not result in differences in students
   learning overall. Some findings pointing to subtle differences, however,
   indicate that the interactive classroom could have made the classroom
   instruction more effective and efficient.},

Abstract = {Purpose - The purpose of this paper is to describe the impacts of
   earthquakes on schools and education services and demonstrate the
   critical role that information and communication technologies (ICTs) can
   play in supporting the continuity of education delivery during temporary
   school closures after seismic events.
   Design/methodology/approach - This paper relies on a conceptual analysis
   that shows the potential role of the online educational environment
   during post-earthquake school closures by relying on the available ICT
   tools.
   Findings - This paper proposes a pro-active strategy for schools that
   transforms traditional education into an online learning environment to
   restore education delivery during school closures after earthquake which
   disrupts face-to-face teaching and denies students and staffs access to
   schools.
   Originality/value - The sustainability of education delivery in the
   aftermath of earthquakes presents a challenge to governments, schools,
   people and communities. This paper contributes to the literature by
   demonstrating the role of online learning in sustaining educational
   delivery services after moderate earthquakes.},

Title = {Effects of inverted L2/Ln language pedagogy on student experiences and
   outcomes: The case of American Sign Language},
Journal = {LANGUAGE TEACHING RESEARCH},
Abstract = {Second language (L2) learning has largely occurred in the traditional
   lecture-based classroom setting. Studies show that the lecture format
   has an impact on student outcomes and perceptions of classroom learning.
   Negative impacts include insufficient time for reinforcement activities,
   reviewing lecture materials, and engaging in conversation between
   instructors and students. An innovative way to enhance L2 students'
   classroom outcomes and perceptions is the inverted classroom pedagogy.
   This study assesses whether the inverted pedagogy leads to more positive
   student perspectives and higher student outcomes compared to traditional
   pedagogy in L2 classrooms in American Sign Language (ASL). In this
   study, student outcomes and instructor and student perceptions of
   inverted pedagogy for ASL are assessed using a mixed method design with
   one controlled (traditional) and one experimental (inverted) advanced
   ASL class in a post-secondary setting. Results suggest that the inverted
   pedagogy is an approach that is as viable as the traditional approach
   for teaching and learning ASL as an L2 that enables students to engage
   in meaningful activities and conversations.},

Abstract = {Technology-enabled active learning environments (TE-ALEs) have attracted
   considerable research interest, particularly in higher education.
   However, research shows inconsistent results describing the influence of
   TE-ALEs toward students' cognitive learning outcomes. This study was
   designed to identify high-quality empirical research examining college
   students' cognitive learning outcomes and to utilize meta-analysis to
   determine the overall effectiveness of TE-ALEs. A systematic literature
   search identified 31 high-quality peer-reviewed journal articles that
   met the inclusion criteria. Meta-analysis showed that the calculated
   effect size of TE-ALEs more positively influenced students' cognitive
   learning than traditional lecture-based environments. Moderator variable
   analysis suggested that social context, study design, and sample size
   were significant factors that influence the effectiveness of TE-ALE.
   TE-ALEs were found more effective when instructors employed
   individualized learning contexts as well as when bias was reduced in
   randomized controlled trials. TE-ALEs were also found to be more
   effective in small courses rather than in large courses.},

Abstract = {Many unique ideas of physical education in colleges and universities
   were proposed in the 1990s by some experts and scholars in China's
   sports field, such as ``skills education ideas,{''} ``happy sports
   ideas,{''} ``lifelong sports ideas,{''} and ``health first ideas,{''}
   and many other higher vocational colleges have begun to implement the
   inverted classroom teaching model into the teaching practice in physical
   education classes. Cooperative learning is a method of learning that is
   systematic and structured. Different approaches, such as collaborative
   learning, personalized learning, digital learning, and so on, aim to
   cultivate students' ``collaborative learning{''} and
   ``self-improvement{''} objectively. The effectiveness of the sports flip
   classroom teaching mode, which is based on cooperative learning, is
   examined in this paper. The cooperative learning mode completes the
   teaching activities in the form of groups in the teaching organization.
   The cooperative learning mode can help students not only improve their
   abilities, but also cultivate a sense of cooperation and teamwork in the
   classroom. We should pay attention to students' participation and
   cooperative behavior when implementing ``cooperative learning{''}
   teaching, so that each student has the opportunity to express himself in
   practice.},

Abstract = {In recent years, there has been widespread interest around the potential
   for technology to transform learning. As investment in education
   technology continues to grow, students, parents, and teachers face a
   seemingly endless array of education technologies from which to
   choose-from digital personalized learning platforms to online courses to
   text message reminders to submit financial aid forms. Amid the
   excitement, it is important to step back and understand how technology
   can help-or in some cases hinder-learning. This review article
   synthesizes and discusses rigorous evidence on the effectiveness of
   technology-based approaches to education in developed countries and
   outlines areas for future inquiry. In particular, we examine randomized
   controlled trials and regression discontinuity studies across the
   following categories of education technology: (i) access to technology,
   (ii) computer-assisted learning, (iii) technology-enabled behavioral
   interventions in education, and (iv) online learning. We hope this
   synthesis will advance academic understanding of how technology can
   improve education, outline key areas for new experimental research, and
   help drive improvements to the policies, programs, and structures that
   contribute to successful teaching and learning.},

Abstract = {The competencies that nursing professionals must develop include, among
   others, the development of critical, reflective, and proactive thinking.
   In addition, you must be able to intervene in the care of the human
   health experience with commitment and responsibility. Objective. To know
   the perceptions of students on the implementation of the inverted
   classroom model in the nursing practice component in critical care.
   Methodology. Descriptive qualitative approach study with content
   analysis based on inductive categorization. Seventy participants,
   nursing students who were in critical care nursing practice, were
   included, the information was collected through a written questionnaire.
   Results. Three categories emerged: 1. Understanding an academic strength
   that is put into practice and being focused on what I need to continue
   learning, 2. Autonomy in learning, an instrument to overcome fears. 3.
   Build safety and communication channels with the patient and family.
   Conclusions. The inverted classroom methodology allowed students to
   focus on gaps in specific knowledge competencies for patient care in the
   context of critical care. On the other hand, it is found that this
   methodology hinders the strengthening of the being's competencies.},

Abstract = {This descriptive classroom-based study involved a group of 25
   pre-service teacher participants from the Master's program in Teaching
   English as a Foreign and Second Language (TEFL) at the Complutense
   University in Madrid (UCM), Spain. The participants were approached in
   their threefold facet as graduate students, classroom active debate
   leaders, and prospective teachers. We aimed to explore what they
   perceived to be the benefits and drawbacks of using multimodal learning
   objects (LO) as learners, active classroom debate leaders and
   pre-service teachers of English in contexts of inverted classroom
   instruction. The results showed that LO were perceived as an excellent
   tool in inverted settings of instruction as they enabled a shift in the
   classroom dynamics towards a learner-centred approach. No significant
   differences were found among the views of students, debate leaders, and
   pre-service teachers. However, pre-service teachers expressed concerns
   about implementing LO. This suggests that more importance should be
   given to support their use in the English classroom.},

Abstract = {Despite the rapid development of the field of Mobile-assisted Language
   Learning (MALL), research synthesis and systematic meta-analyses on MALL
   are still lacking. It remains unclear how effective mobile devices are
   for language learning under different conditions. Review studies on the
   overall effectiveness of the latest smart mobile devices are still
   scant. In order to evaluate the learning outcomes of MALL and the impact
   of moderator variables, we systematically searched journal articles,
   conference proceedings, and doctoral dissertations published during
   2008-2018 and performed a meta-analysis based on a synthesis of 84
   effect sizes from 80 experimental and quasi-experimental studies. A
   medium-to-high effect size of 0.722 was found for the overall
   effectiveness of using mobile devices for language learning. The
   findings indicate that the use of mobile devices for language learning
   is more effective than conventional methods. The effects of nine
   moderator variables were analyzed. The target language skill, target
   language and first/second language were found to be significant
   moderators. Implications for language teaching and research are
   discussed.},

Abstract = {Background and purpose: To identify student perceptions associated with
   a learner-centered, multi-stage, flipped, new student orientation for a
   doctor of pharmacy (PharmD) program.
   Educational activity and setting: First-year PharmD students over three
   years (2012-2014) were engaged in a two-phase learner-centered
   orientation process designed to allow students to customize the
   transition experience. After orientation, students completed a survey to
   assess programming and their perceptions of readiness to begin the
   PharmD program. Utilizing student feedback, the orientation program
   evolved each year to better meet the needs of incoming students.
   Findings: In 2014, 78.9\% of students felt confident in their ability to
   transition to the PharmD program after orientation, an increase from
   55.7\% in 2012 when the changes in orientation were first implemented.
   Additionally, student perceptions of readiness to transition to the
   PharmD program improved each year.
   Discussion and summary: Implementation of a learner-centered, flipped,
   new student orientation may improve students' perceptions of readiness
   for study and decrease anxiety of transitioning to a PharmD program.
   Additionally, it may be an effective tool for increasing orientation
   program efficiency, while improving student engagement.},

Abstract = {In this article, we present an integrated instructive methodological
   approach. We begin with a set of proposals for educational innovation
   oriented towards active learning that have been tested separately and
   implemented for various subjects in courses of different levels. The
   approach integrates the following elements: (1) the dynamic generation
   of digital content by students and their integration into shared
   knowledge bases of the subjects involved; (2) the systematic use of
   quality content, mainly in video format, distributed through online
   platforms as support for flipped classrooms; (3) peer evaluation to
   support the development of reflective and self-critical capacities; and
   (4) systematic collaboration with students and professors from other
   universities to develop the enumerated activities. The methodology has
   been tested in a variety of subjects, thanks to its flexibility. In all
   experienced cases, it has been shown that it is feasible for students to
   generate enough valuable and reusable content. In addition, students
   have expressed high levels of satisfaction with the implementation of
   the proposal.},

Abstract = {Despite evidence concerning the widespread growth of K-12 blended
   teaching and the impact that emergency remote teaching during the
   COVID-19 pandemic has had on the spread of K-12 online and blended
   teaching, we could find no systematic reviews focused on preparing K-12
   teachers for blended teaching. Previous literature reviews, such as
   those from Halverson et al. (2012) and Drysdale et al. (2013), have
   noted the lack of research focused on K-12 blended teaching contexts.
   This systematic mapping review (Grant \& Booth, 2009) of 88 K-12 blended
   teacher preparation articles focused on identifying trends in author
   impact according to citation count and number of publications, journal
   impact according to number of publications, prevalence of research
   methods, and prevalence of research themes according to research
   questions and findings. The analysis provides a valuable snapshot of
   current literature, sets a foundation for a deeper thematic analysis of
   K-12 blended teacher preparation literature, and identifies some
   potential areas for future K-12 blended teaching research.},

Abstract = {NIE (newspaper in education), which is the study utilizing
   newspaper-based educational resources in the classroom, has been pursued
   for a long time. Traditional NIE allows only one-way interaction and
   available media are limited. In addition, it has difficulty in capturing
   the latest ``hot{''} issues or recognizing public opinions. In this
   paper, we propose a platform called TNIE (Twitter news in education)
   that utilizes Twitter in NIE. TNIE has many advantages compared to
   traditional NIE: (1) it classifies the latest news into various topics,
   (2) the classified news content can be browsed effectively via a
   hierarchical visualization scheme, and (3) effective discussion or
   debate groups can be easily formed based on the learners' news
   selection. To evaluate the performance of our scheme, we implemented a
   prototype system and performed several experiments. According to the
   results, our news classification scheme achieved an 87.8 \% F-measure on
   average, which is superior to the 78.94 \% of previous studies. We also
   had volunteers use our prototype system and evaluate its main functions,
   e.g., news visualization, classification, learner clustering, and
   collaborative learning. We report some of these evaluation results.},

Abstract = {Students \& x2019; participation and motivation are of great importance
   in their learning process. The decrease in attendance and difficulties
   in stimulating students \& x2019; activity makes it necessary to find
   new methodologies that can solve these problems. The use of game
   mechanics in non-ludic environments (Gamification) has begun to be of
   great interest in research, since it could increase the motivation and
   therefore the activity of the students. This study tries to verify if
   there is an existing relationship between gamification and a possible
   increase in student activity or between the cessation of gamification
   and student activity. In addition, it evaluates whether a greater
   student activity corresponds to a greater learning improvement. In the
   obtained results, no significant differences were found between the
   methodology or the activity with a learning improvement. According to
   the study, the simple use of gamified elements does not necessarily
   imply a solution to the problems posed. The students \& x2019; activity
   in a course of these characteristics does not imply a better learning
   improvement, the importance lies in the quality of the activity
   generated and not in the quantity.},

Abstract = {Ensuring students develop person-centred practice for diverse groups of
   people across health care settings is an important outcome of
   undergraduate nursing education. This paper presents the development and
   evaluation of a learning innovation, an integrated virtual patient case
   study and complementary online resources for person-centred nursing
   practice. The virtual patient case study of an Australian Aboriginal
   woman diagnosed with breast cancer was integrated within four core
   subjects of a Bachelor of Nursing program, for a total of 600
   second-year students. The evaluation of this learning strategy was
   encouraging. Students reported that the online learning activities were
   engaging, particularly due to the level of realism, their understanding
   of Aboriginal Peoples' healthcare needs increased, and they developed
   therapeutic communication skills, applicable in a variety of healthcare
   contexts. Staff concerns about student wellbeing when learning sensitive
   content online were unfounded. When carefully planned, a virtual patient
   case study and online learning resources can support students to enhance
   their person-centred nursing practice. Further evaluation, including
   student outcomes through assessment, is an important next step.},

Title = {Fostering Sustainability and Critical Thinking through Debate-A Case
   Study},
Journal = {SUSTAINABILITY},
Year = {2021},
Volume = {13},
Number = {11},
Month = {JUN},
Abstract = {Transversal competences such as sustainability or critical thinking have
   become more important in the last decades in University teaching. The
   objective of this article is to assess the effectiveness of debate as a
   teaching method capable of fostering such competences in engineering
   students. To do this, a debate activity has been held facing two
   reasonable positions: Sustainable Development versus Degrowth. The
   research methodology consisted of performing this activity in the
   classroom (with 13 students in this particular case study), and
   conducting some tests before and after the debate that served as
   feedback to assess the effectiveness of the debate on the learning
   process. This feedback is composed of different documents, including a
   pre-post test, a specific survey about the debate, a pre-post knowledge
   survey and the Student Evaluation of Educational Quality (SEEQ) survey.
   A methodology for the organization of the debate is proposed and the
   answers of the students to these feedback documents are analyzed. As it
   can be inferred from the different surveys, the debate has been an
   efficient learning tool to acquire knowledge and to develop
   sustainability and critical thinking competences.},

Abstract = {Educators are concerned about dwindling class attendance, while
   employers call for work-ready, socially skilled, and self-driven
   graduates. Various andragogies have been proposed to supplement
   traditional lecture-based methods, but studies have not yet investigated
   a strategy of methods within a particular marketing topic. The present
   study focuses on sensory marketing and compares seven experiential
   teaching methods, designed to improve engagement, enjoyment,
   inter-personal and higher-order thinking skills. By strategically
   combining seven teaching methods, this paper proposes an inter-active
   teaching strategy linked to prior understanding, scaffolded by peer and
   practitioner advice, and aimed at applying the knowledge to real-world
   phenomena. Students rate teacher-led discussions highest of all
   methodologies used to explain marketing theories. Small group
   discussions were rated low across all domains; enjoyment, understanding
   and theory application. The hermeneutic competency development strategy
   (HCD) tested here is successful in achieving all preset learning
   objectives. This empirical study contributes to enhanced understanding
   of the value of flipped classrooms from students' perspectives. (c) 2018

Title = {Analysis of Creative Thinking Skills Development under Active Learning
   Strategies},
Journal = {EDUCATION SCIENCES},
Year = {2021},
Volume = {11},
Number = {10},
Month = {OCT},
Abstract = {Educational systems are now focusing on skills enhancement, such as
   creative thinking skills (CTS), as a means of long-lasting, significant
   learning. To this end, some universities and higher education
   institutions incentivize active learning (AL) strategies as CTS
   developers. Indeed, a positive link among creative results, time
   availability, and the educational environment has been reported;
   however, it is mainly based on qualitative and perceptual results. For
   this reason, we present this comparative, quantitative study in the
   context of a Mexican high school, weighing the effectiveness of the
   flipped learning and gamification teaching strategies against a
   conventional approach. The study revealed no differences in the learning
   environment; instead, the type of activity and the teamwork interaction
   affected CTS the most. However, those who participated in the learning
   Strategies (LS) evaluated themselves higher than their peers in the
   traditional classes. These results highlight the independence of CTS
   toward the referred LS and set a departing point for further research
   addressing the course activities' qualities seemingly related to CTS
   enhancement.</p>},

Abstract = {This paper presents a systematic literature review of academic staff
   experiences and perceptions of adopting Technology for Assessment
   OF/FOR/AS Learning in Higher Education. This paper is a qualitative
   synthesis of 65 peer-reviewed journal articles published between 2012
   and 2017 reporting on the use of technology for assessment (TfA). The
   results suggest that there are some efficiencies for staff in
   implementing TfA but this can come with a cost at the set-up and
   maintenance phases. Furthermore, results indicated that assessment
   design is not of foremost concern to academic staff when introducing
   TfA, but that a wide variety of pressures and both educational and
   operational drivers are present. There were inconclusive findings in
   relation to understandings of appropriate institutional environments and
   supports for TfA to flourish in higher education. There is a need for
   empirical research, particularly longitudinal investigations, of
   academic experiences of implementations of TfA to investigate
   sustainability of adoption. The imperative of exploring the academic
   staff perspective as the instigator and manager of both the technology
   and the student learning experience requires deep consideration as TfA
   adoption progresses.},
