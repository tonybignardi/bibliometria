Abstract = {The Flipped Classroom (FC) methodology has been gaining prominence in
   recent years in the various stages of schooling. An example of this is
   the growing number of articles about FC that can be found in scientific
   journals. The objective of this research is to analyze the scientific
   production about FC in the area of mathematics teaching. Five variables
   of analysis have been determined: academic performance, students'
   self-perception, the role acquired by students, social interaction and
   attitudes towards mathematics classes. The international databases
   consulted to carry out the systematic review were Scopus and Web Of
   Science (WoS), where 215 and 198 documents were obtained respectively;
   having set the time period of the search between 2010 and 2020. After
   exclusions, 86 articles comprising 20,027 students were submitted to our
   meta-analysis. The analysis of the different papers seems to indicate
   that the use of FC favors the learning of mathematics in different
   aspects such as academic performance, active participation, motivation,
   interest and interaction among students and between students and
   teachers.},

Abstract = {This study was carried out to determine the effectiveness of the Flipped
   Classroom Model (FCM) in an educational setting. For this purpose, a
   multi-complementary approach (MCA) was used including both quantitative
   (meta-analysis) and qualitative (thematic). MCA consists of three parts,
   the first of which is the pre-complementary information stage. In this
   context, the data from sixty-four studies were used and it was analysed
   using CMA and MetaWin software. In addition, the meta-thematic data were
   obtained by analysing thirty-two qualitative studies of FCM and analysed
   through content analysis. In the second stage of the MCA, an
   experimental process took place involving the implementation of FCM. A
   thematic dimension was added to the second stage and analyses were made
   through MAXQDA software. In the last stage of the approach, the results
   of the first two stages were combined to get complementary and general
   outcomes. The results of the study showed that FCM had a positive impact
   on academic success in general, thus some recommendations were presented
   on the use of both FCM and MCA.},

Abstract = {The article considers the application of the flipped classroom in a
   university for the teaching of languages. This is used as a means of
   stimulating the motivation, cognitive independence and activity of
   students in the process of mastering a foreign language at a
   professional level. The research was applied in the discipline ``History
   of the French language{''} in the foreign language (French) students of
   the Federal University of Kazan. It is concluded that this educational
   technology develops critical thinking of students, due to the nature of
   the problem of learning tasks, increases the responsibility of students,
   as well as their capacity for self-organization, among other aspects.},

Abstract = {In the study, the effect of flipped classroom approach applied to
   chemistry I class in a foreign language high school was explored.
   Flipped classroom was applied to 176 grade 10 students (43 boys and 133
   girls) from a foreign language high school located in a metropolitan
   city for one semester and its instructional effects were studied in
   terms of cognitive and affective aspects. Before the class, students
   were provided with guiding worksheets and asked to summarize contents.
   Within the class, various student-centered activities were adopted.
   After the flipped classroom for one semester, mid-term and final-term
   exam scores were analyzed, and students' attitude toward chemistry class
   and flipped classroom were surveyed. Analysis on the exam scores showed
   the possibility for positive impact on students' achievement and
   perceptions on chemistry class including flipped classroom approach.
   Moreover, some students mentioned flipped classroom was helpful for
   self-directed learning and meta-cognition. Based on these results,
   educational implications were discussed.},

Abstract = {Objective: To assess the effectiveness of flipped classroom on
   dermatology residents' learning of procedural skills, and to identify
   their perceptions about it.
   Methods: The case-control study was conducted at Dermatology department
   of Pak Emirates Military and Combined Military Hospital Rawalpindi from
   1/3/2018 to 2/7/2018, and comprised post-graduate dermatology residents
   training at Pak Emirates Military and Combined Military Hospital,
   Rawalpindi, Pakistan. The residents were randomised into two equal
   groups. A pre-test consisting of multiple-choice questions was taken.
   Group A was emailed the related teaching material 1 week prior to the
   session. The in the subsequent week, both groups attended a 3-hour
   hands-on training session. In the first hour, Group A had small group
   discussion, while Group B attended interactive lecture utilising the
   same teaching material that was posted to Group A earlier. Both groups
   then participated in hands-on session with the same facilitators. The
   process was repeated next week for another topic. Finally, a post-test
   comprising multiple-choice questions and objectively structured clinical
   exam at 16 stations was conducted. Group A answered the flipped
   classroom perception instrument and three open-ended questions.
   Quantitative data was analysed using SPSS 21, while manual thematic
   analysis was done for qualitative data.
   Results: Of the 40 subjects, there were 40(50\%) in each of the two
   groups. There was a significant difference between median pre-test and
   post-test scores in both groups (p<0.001).. With respect to objectively
   structured clinical exam, the median score of Group A was significantly
   different from Group B (p=0.001).
   Conclusion: Flipped classroom was found to be an effective teaching
   strategy for procedural skills in dermatology residents.},

Abstract = {A sudden lockdown was declared on 14 March 2020 due to COVID-19 crisis,
   leading to an immediate change from face-to-face to online learning in
   all universities within Spanish jurisdiction. At La Salle School of
   Architecture, the Concrete and Steel Structures subject started online
   classes immediately after the lockdown law was published, using a
   methodology based on the flipped classroom approach and adapting the
   monitoring of the student to the virtual environment. This article
   presents a pilot study to analyze the adaptation of the model to the
   online format using a mixed approach in which qualitative and
   quantitative surveys were conducted at the end of the course with 48
   participants. Responses from both surveys were organized according to
   six categories (teachers, assessment, methods, class development,
   students and documents) and 14 subcategories, as developed in an
   undergoing research project involving the subject since the academic
   year 2017/2018. Thus, the open responses of the students have been
   analyzed alongside with the quantitative data. The results demonstrate a
   proper adaptation of the model, as well as the negative perception of
   the students of the online format due to the loss of face-to-face
   benefits of the flipped classroom.},

Abstract = {Flipped classroom (FC) pedagogical frameworks have recently gained
   considerable popularity, especially at secondary school levels. However,
   there are rich opportunities to explore FC at tertiary levels, but
   progress on the area requires instructors' attention to well-designed
   tasks for students' collaborative learning. Realistic Mathematics
   Education (RME) provides a foundation for the development of such tasks.
   This article advances research on the role of task design in a FC
   context by considering how RME heuristics may be developed to include
   the out-of-class phase, where students prepare for in-class work with
   videos. This adaption, named flipped RME classroom design, is explored
   through two realizations of such a design with a group of computer
   engineering students during their first year of studying compulsory
   mathematics. Thematic analysis of the classroom observations shows that
   students' modelling activity in-class is supported by the design of an
   out-of-class component in combination with teacher guidance of students'
   modelling activity.},

Abstract = {A flipped classroom is an instructional model in which students learn
   basic subject matter knowledge prior to classroom meetings, and then
   come to classroom for active learning experiences. Previous research has
   shown that flipped classroom have a positive impact on students'
   learning. Most current studies focus on students' learning experiences
   in flipped classroom courses. However, this qualitative case study
   investigated three higher education instructors' adoption of flipped
   classroom, with special focus on the adjustments they made and the
   suggestions they offered to make a successful flipped classroom course.
   Semistructured interviews and course artifacts were collected from the
   three instructors. Findings highlighted that they made a main adjustment
   on allocating a brief period of in-class time to address students'
   pre-class learning materials, and they suggested that helping students
   form good learning habits and integrating resources from other courses
   and other program activities into flipped classroom instruction can
   enhance the instructional efficiency. Findings also reveal that
   instructors look forward to more peer assistance among instructors.},

Abstract = {Starting from the premise of investing moments and roles of traditional
   teaching for the innovation of the teaching-learning process, flipped
   classroom was implemented in a postgraduate course. The objective was:
   to analyze the experience of students regarding the implementation of
   the inverted classroom. The qualitative approach research used the
   content analysis technique based on the written argument of 13 students
   who presented an essay about their training experience at the end of the
   semester; in addition, the observation record of the teacher responsible
   for the subject was considered. The main findings revealed the initial
   need to adapt to the model, to later make it part of the dynamics of its
   training process, being an option that made the environment in which the
   class developed more flexible. It was a model accepted by the students,
   even with certain reservations, and in addition to identifying the need
   for adaptation to it, the results lead to infer that the literature is
   not overwhelming regarding its impact, in terms of adjustment and
   acceptance of its implications for teaching and learning, so it is
   necessary to use different methodological approaches to obtain empirical
   data that show valid testimonies and talk about the model.},

Abstract = {This paper aims to provide clear and appropriate evidence of factors
   that trigger student engagement of flipped classroom (FC) learning in
   higher education (HE), based on an example of a fully flipped business
   undergraduate degree program in Australia. Qualitative data from the
   Student Evaluation of Teaching and Units (SETU) of 142 first-year
   business students over seven consecutive trimesters (2017-2019) were
   gathered and analyzed using thematic analysis. The findings provide a
   nuanced understanding on triggers of student engagement in relation to
   self-efficacy, emotion, well-being and belonging. The findings may guide
   educators in full adoption of FC in other undergraduate courses.},

Abstract = {Innovative methods can change the paradigm of teaching mathematics and
   inspire teachers to espouse new ideas and gain new experiences. The
   flipped classroom (FC) is currently an innovative pedagogical approach
   that has high potential to transform the teaching of mathematics. In the
   case study described in this paper, we investigated one mathematics
   teacher's transformation of teaching in two mathematics classrooms
   through implementing interventions based on FC methods; furthermore, we
   identified several key points of FC design as well as challenges and
   opportunities afforded by teaching mathematics in FCs. The results of
   the study showed that the tasks posed by the teacher, the implemented
   discourse, teacher feedback and scaffolding, and the teaching-learning
   environment were changed in FCs, although the approaches used by the
   teacher to analyze the tasks and students' learning were similar to
   those used in non-FCs, which points out the strengths of traditional
   teaching approaches. The study indicates that although teaching
   mathematics in FCs created some difficulties for teaching, well-designed
   FCs offered a great opportunity to promote students' mathematical
   thinking and understanding. Overall, the results highlight that through
   FC, teachers can develop students' mathematical potential with FCs.},

Abstract = {In this paper we report on our evaluation of the impact of a flipped
   classroom approach on the learning experience of students undertaking an
   undergraduate biology course. The flipped sessions comprised
   pre-recorded lectures, online quizzes and in-class group activities in
   the course design. The success of the approach was evaluated on the
   basis of perceptions held by the course coordinator and students on how
   the new course design influenced the student learning experience. Data
   were collected through a student questionnaire and structured interviews
   with the course coordinator. Overall, the students reported a high
   degree of satisfaction with some elements of the flipped approach.
   However, some activities were less well regarded, with concerns
   identified by the course coordinator and students. A key finding was
   that elements from the model for student learning design presented in
   this article were correlated with student confidence, motivation and
   engagement. It was concluded that refinements of components of the
   flipped design, such as the pre-recorded lectures and the structure of
   the in-class sessions, may further enhance the student learning
   experience in this course.},

   materials to prepare for laboratory on their own. Eliminating in-class
   preparation provided the opportunity to end each period with integrative
   group activities that connected laboratory and lecture material and
   explored clinical correlations. Materials provided for prelaboratory
   preparation included: custom-made, three-dimensional (3D) anatomy
   videos, abbreviated dissection instructions, key atlas figures, and
   dissection videos. Data from three years of the course (n=241 students)
   allowed for analysis of students' preferences for these materials and
   detailed tracking of usage of 3D anatomy videos. Students reported
   spending an average of 27:22 (+/- 17:56) minutes preparing for
   laboratory, similar to the 30 minutes previously allocated for in-class
   dissection preparation. The 3D anatomy videos and key atlas figures were
   rated the most helpful resources. Scores on laboratory examinations were
   compared for the three years before the curriculum change (2011-2013;
   n=242) and three years after (2014-2016; n=241). There was no change in
   average grades on the first and second laboratory examinations. However,
   on the final semi-cumulative laboratory examination, scores were
   significantly higher in the post-flip classes (P=0.04). These results
   demonstrate an effective model for applying flipped classroom pedagogy
   to the gross anatomy laboratory and illustrate a meaningful role for 3D
   anatomy visualizations in a dissection-based course. Anat Sci Educ 11:

Abstract = {Innovative teaching strategies are designing a new and promising
   landscape in education. They fill lessons with creativity and
   imagination for either the students or teachers. This article addresses
   an attempt to make the approach to science easier in a nonscientific
   environment: primary education at university level. Gamification
   methodologies were combined with a flipped classroom in order to free up
   in-class time and engage the students with the taught courses. A
   qualitative study was merged with quantitative measures of emotional and
   motivational parameters. These results were improved with four
   semistructured interviews. The results clearly showed a rise in the
   students' motivational levels, an acknowledgment of good teaching
   practices, and an evident enhancement of felt positive emotions toward
   science teaching and scientific issues.},

Abstract = {This article wants to show that the flipped classroom can be used as a
   tool to promote the strengthening of active listening. This work is part
   of an applied research that was carried out in an educational
   institution in Barranquilla. The sample consisted of ten students, where
   three of them present special educational needs (SEN). A methodology was
   applied from the socio-critical paradigm, qualitative research and the
   research - action approach. In turn, the deployment of five phases was
   necessary: observation, diagnosis, planning, execution and evaluation.
   The results were obtained, after applying the last workshop of the
   pedagogical proposal designed, that nine of the students listen to the
   ideas of others and share their own to carry out work collaboratively;
   eight of them listen and respond to the ideas of the other without using
   language or gestures that demean or ridicule him; Nine use non-verbal
   language appropriately, such as looking at people who are part of the
   audience, maintaining a correct posture when speaking and listening, the
   appropriate tone of voice to be heard and gestures that indicate that
   they are actively listening and; only eight, listen and answer the
   questions asked promptly and without deviations. Thus, it is concluded
   that the students made significant progress throughout the development
   of the proposal. It was shown that the flipped classroom is a great tool
   to strengthen active listening, and leads to the acquisition of skills
   such as teamwork.},

Title = {Effects of a patient safety course using a flipped classroom approach
   among undergraduate nursing students: A quasi-experimental study},
Journal = {NURSE EDUCATION TODAY},
Year = {2019},
Volume = {79},

Abstract = {Background: The nursing education system has changed with the increased
   emphasis on patient safety in healthcare settings. Early education in
   patient safety is crucial to preparing nurses to be competent in patient
   care. Therefore, providing undergraduate patient safety education
   courses using an innovative approach is essential to enhancing patient
   safety and quality in nursing care.
   Objectives: This study aimed to examine the effects of a patient safety
   course using a flipped classroom approach on patient safety competency
   among undergraduate nursing students in South Korea.
   Design: A pre- and post-test quasi-experimental design with a
   non-equivalent control group was adopted.
   Settings: This study was conducted in the college of nursing at a
   university in Seoul, South Korea.
   Participants: A total of 75 undergraduate nursing students participated.
   All students enrolled in the patient safety course comprised the
   experimental group (n = 32); those with similar characteristics to the
   experimental group (age, gender, and year) but did not take the course
   comprised the control group (n = 43).
   Methods: A total of 14 sessions (28 h) addressing the topics from the
   World Health Organization patient safety curriculum guide were delivered
   using a flipped classroom approach. The teaching methods included online
   learning and quizzes, case studies, small and large discussions,
   incident report tasks, and group projects including the development of
   strategies for patient safety. A survey including a demographic
   questionnaire and the Patient Safety Competency Self-Evaluation tool was
   administered at the beginning and end of the fall semester.
   Results: Pre- and post-test results demonstrated a significant increase
   in students' patient safety competency including attitude, skills, and
   knowledge. Mean scores of patient safety competency in the experimental
   group were significantly higher than in the control group.
   Conclusions: The flipped-classroom patient safety course was shown to be
   effective in improving patient safety competency in terms of attitude,
   skills, and knowledge among undergraduate nursing students.},

Abstract = {The progress in the digital world has generated a radical change in the
   way to access and transmit knowledge. The learning process is no more an
   internal and individual activity; nowadays is a collective activity in
   the network. This article describes the results of a quantitative study
   which purpose was to analyse the students' perceptions and valuations
   regarding the implementations of the flipped classroom model. An ad hoc
   questionnaire was designed. Data were collected longitudinally during
   two academic years, 2015-2016 and 2016-2017. The sample of the study was
   259 participants. Results show that in general learning experience and
   its effectivity improve, being the most positive results in the older
   students. Among the conclusions we highlight that the model improves
   students' motivation but it requires high levels of responsibility and
   commitment in both students and teachers.},

Title = {Evaluation of a gamification and flipped-classroom program used in

Journal = {PLOS ONE},

Abstract = {Recent years have witnessed the arrival of new methodological horizons
   in teacher training. Technological resources and mobile connections play
   a major role in these studies. At the same time, there is a focus on
   play to increase commitment and motivation. It is in this context that
   gamification and flipped-classroom strategies have arisen. This paper
   presents the results of a training program with future Primary Education
   teachers using gamification and flipped-classroom strategies and
   techniques. The aim was that teachers in training acquire competences in
   proposing innovative teaching units. The learning achieved through the
   program was evaluated by collecting perceptions via a questionnaire and
   using an observation scale of the didactic units designed. The program
   was implemented in four classroom groups (N = 210) at the University of
   Murcia (Spain). Descriptive statistics are shown; mean tests (t of
   Student and ANOVA of one factor); non-parametric tests (U-Mann Whitney
   test); and Pearson correlations between subscales. The data show a very
   positive assessment of the learning achieved and the strategies applied
   in the training program. The learning outcomes were satisfactory,
   although lower than perceived. Some differences between class groups and
   gender are discussed, and some weaknesses of the program are pointed
   out.},

Abstract = {The flipped classroom is a hybrid teaching proposal that has been
   discussed and applied in engineering education on higher education. This
   paper aims to investigate the pedagogical model of Inverted Classroom,
   applied in the training of engineers, from the scientific publications
   that discuss this theme. We used the methodology of systematic review
   called Methodi Ordinatio which makes use of systemic steps that allow
   the ordering of articles by relevance, considering three important
   characteristics: the number of citations, the impact factor and the year
   of publication. The search for articles was carried out at the bases:
   Science Direct, Scielo, Scopus and Web of Science. From the 325 articles
   found, a more detailed analysis was carried out on the first 15 papers
   classified by order of relevance. The results pointed to the absence of
   theoretical material to direct the teaching practice from the
   pedagogical model of the Inverted Classroom, the scarcity of the
   approach of the subject in the teacher training and teaching
   difficulties for the practice. However, in contrast, it points to the
   benefits of the model in order to train engineers effectively.},

   great properties to the development of motor and coordinative skills,
   and also to teach the values and indicators underlined into the
   curriculum. The aim of this study was to design an innovative strategy
   used the Flipped Classroom methodology in order to teach the judo into
   the Secondary Educational phase. The use of digital tools allowed a
   proper information exchange and the autonomous learning out of the
   school, joining to the making videos. During the classes, cooperative
   strategies and coevaluation processes were implemented, allowing a more
   individualized learning. This methodology was really enriched, and the
   student and teachers achieved high level of motivation despite of the

Abstract = {While increasingly demands have been made on Higher Education
   Institutions for revamping curriculum designs and instructional
   pedagogies to adapt to the 21st century digitized learning and skill
   environment, the COVID-19 pandemic underscored this adaption as the
   singular solution to maintain the learning continuum. The inverted or
   flipped classroom has emerged as an enabling learning framework offering
   a convergence of technological advancements with active and
   collaborative learning. This study investigates the correlation between
   the flipped learning pedagogy in higher education and the acquisition of
   21st century skills in the current digitized environment to meet
   Industry 4.0 readiness landscape. Primary data for this study was
   collected using a scientifically deployed mixed methods survey research
   and in-depth interviews from undergraduate students across universities
   to get their input on what they experienced and perceived as learners
   through the classroom flip experience. Until today, there has been lack
   of focus on Higher Education in the literature on an effective pedagogy
   for cultivating 21st century skills. This is an original research work
   which presents a holistic view of what elements are offered by `flipped
   learning' as key to the development of 21st century skills and
   competences considering the demands of the fourth industrial revolution
   (IR 4.0) from Higher Education Institutions, for creation of a job
   resilient workforce. The findings of the study showed that the flipped
   classroom model was experientially and perceptibly preferred by
   undergraduates for the acquisition of 21st century skills and
   competencies needed for industry 4.0 readiness amongst other reasons.
   The results of this study have implications for students, faculty and
   higher education institutions.},

Abstract = {This mixed research uses the Juran's methodology to achieve continuous
   improvement in the teaching-learning process on mathematics through
   technology. This study proposes the creation of a virtual environment by
   means of the FreeDFD simulator, flipped classroom and YouTube videos
   with the purpose of linking the theoretical topics in the Logical of
   Predicates Unit with the field of computer science. The variables
   related to the teaching-learning process are Efficiency (assimilation of
   knowledge) and Technical Quality (Bloom's Taxonomy: Memory,
   Comprehension and Application). On the other hand, students' perception
   is analyzed through the Quality of service (teaching-learning process,
   technological ability and mathematical ability) and Customer
   satisfaction (utility, benefits and need). By means of data mining
   (decision trees technique), this research identifies four predictive
   models on assimilation of knowledge considering Bloom's Taxonomy. The
   results obtained from linear regression (machine learning with 50\%
   training and 50\% evaluation) indicate that the Juran's methodology
   facilitates the construction of virtual educational spaces through the
   stages related to the identification of clients, establishment of
   customer needs, translation of needs into the language of the
   organization, development of the product or service, creation of a
   process and transfer of the process to the operation. In conclusion,
   universities should improve educational conditions considering aspects
   of the technology, flipped classroom and continuous improvement.},

Abstract = {The creation of educational activities encouraging prosocial activity
   related to the promotion of health is essential for enhancing citizens'
   quality of life. Therefore, it is important to make adolescents aware of
   particular prosocial actions which could also help them in their
   training on a personal level. The objective of this educational
   intervention, based on Flipped Classroom methodology, is adolescents'
   training in organ transplantation and donation by creating audiovisual
   stories on related topics, with the aim of improving their understanding
   of it. To this end, the adolescents watched eleven interviews which
   explained the most relevant issues with regard to organ transplantation
   and donation. Over sixty audiovisual stories were presented. The
   activity was positively received and the topics covered revealed that
   participants had gained an effective assimilation of the key points on
   organ transplantation and donation.},

Title = {Learning Outcomes and Student Preferences with Flipped vs Lecture/Case
   Teaching Model in a Block Curriculum},
Journal = {AMERICAN JOURNAL OF PHARMACEUTICAL EDUCATION},

Abstract = {Objective. To assess the impact of using a flipped classroom
   instructional approach on Doctor of Pharmacy (PharmD) students' learning
   outcomes and instructional preferences in a pharmacotherapy course
   within a block curriculum.
   Methods. Select topics in a gastrointestinal and liver pharmacotherapy
   course were taught using a flipped classroom method that required
   students to view lecture modules and respond to self-assessment
   questions prior to class. Classroom time included quizzes, application
   exercises, and discussion. The following year, teaching of these topics
   was switched back to a lecture/case format, and different topics were
   taught in the flipped classroom format, Student performance under each
   teaching method was examined, and student preferences and study habits
   were collected via a survey administered before and after experiencing
   the flipped classroom.
   Results. Combined mean formal assessment scores were higher for all four
   topics taught using the flipped classroom format compared to the
   lecture/case format. This pattern persisted when topics were examined
   individually, except for scores on one review topic. Survey responses
   reflected acknowledgement by about half of the students that the flipped
   format was more beneficial than traditional methods, but they still
   clearly preferred live lectures over prerecorded lectures. The majority
   of students reported that the amount of preparation time required for
   the flipped classroom was appropriate and that they had a positive or
   neutral experience with the flipped classroom overall.
   Conclusion. This study supports use of the flipped classroom method for
   teaching standard pharmacotherapy topics within a block curriculum, but
   underscores some of the resistance expressed by students despite
   understanding the potential benefits of the flipped format.},

Abstract = {At the beginning of 2020, e-learning was not yet valued in the culture
   of Tunisian university. However, the COVID-19 Pandemic was the cause of
   the accelerated deployment of e-learning-related devices. Moreover, it
   seems that the context of health crisis experienced in the world and
   particularly in Tunisia represents a factor pushing Tunisian university
   to reduce, or even eliminate, face-to-face courses for precautionary
   measures. This is likely to allow students to improve their knowledge,
   especially for those who require great concentration and time for
   reflection. The paper shows a very different approach with an analysis
   of the students' difficulties by focusing on the mistakes made in
   solving the problems in the case study. The study makes an original
   contribution to knowledge. It breaks new intellectual ground. Indeed,
   flipped learning in particular seems to affect students on a
   psychological level, making them more engaged, more motivated, and
   better able to self-regulate. This is the intuition of many flipped
   learning instructors, but intuition is just a hypothesis. Nevertheless,
   the results indicate that there is a gap as regards the flipped
   classroom approach.},

Abstract = {This paper aims to explore time management strategies followed by
   students in a flipped classroom through the analysis of trace data.
   Specifically, an exploratory study was conducted on the dataset
   collected in three consecutive offerings of an undergraduate computer
   engineering course (N = 1,134). Trace data about activities were
   initially coded for the timeliness of activity completion. Such data
   were then analysed using agglomerative hierarchical clustering based on
   Ward's algorithm, first order Markov chains, and inferential statistics
   to (a) detect time management tactics and strategies from students'
   learning activities and (b) analyse the effects of personalized
   analytics-based feedback on time management. The results indicate that
   meaningful and theoretically relevant time management patterns can be
   detected from trace data as manifestations of students' tactics and
   strategies. The study also showed that time management tactics had
   significant associations with academic performance and were associated
   with different interventions in personalized analytics-based feedback.},

Title = {English Translation Teaching Model of Flipped Classroom Based on the
   Fusion Algorithm of Network Communication and Artificial Intelligence},
Journal = {WIRELESS COMMUNICATIONS \& MOBILE COMPUTING},
Year = {2021},
Volume = {2021},
Month = {OCT 31},
Abstract = {With the advent of the information age and the rapid development of
   communication technology, traditional teaching methods and methods can
   no longer meet people's needs for education in the information age. This
   research mainly discusses the flipped classroom English translation
   teaching model based on the fusion algorithm of network communication
   and artificial intelligence. This research proposes an Internet learning
   platform based on Tencent's QQ communication software and mobile
   terminals. This learning platform can meet the learning needs of flipped
   classrooms, without spending a lot of investment in hardware and
   software development. This is a relatively ideal Internet learning
   platform suitable for students to carry out flipped classroom learning.
   Most of these mobile terminals have functions such as video playback,
   document reading and editing, wireless network connection, QQ
   communication, and large-capacity storage. These functions provide
   support for the smooth implementation of flip class. The video playback
   function can meet the needs of students to download and watch
   microvideos. Students can use mobile terminals to watch anytime,
   anywhere. The document reading and editing function can help students
   read related learning materials online, including self-study test
   questions, task lists, and teaching evaluation forms. Under this
   platform, students and teachers who are participants in the learning
   process are linked to each other through the QQ of the network terminal.
   The learning resources are uploaded by the teacher to the group file for
   students to download and watch. Students use the QQ group to give
   feedback and discuss difficult problems. This kind of learning network
   that flexibly chooses the learning time and place according to the
   individual student's own situation is very efficient and convenient.
   After the English translation test, the failure rate of the experimental
   class was only 3.3\%, while in the control class, the failure rate was
   8.3\%. This research will better integrate the flipped classroom
   teaching mode and English translation teaching by building a learning
   exchange platform, which will help improve the quality of teaching.},

Abstract = {From the late 1800s to the present day, ionizing radiations played a
   very important role in fields regarding everyday life and research. In
   this work, we cover several physical and historical aspects from the EM
   waves to the particles. In particular, after a brief introduction of
   electromagnetism and EM spectrum, we talk about some ionizing radiations
   focusing on their detection and their natural and artificial sources.
   Furthermore, we show the importance and use of these kind of radiations
   for medical applications and their biological effects. Finally, we
   propose the deepening of one of the topics covered through the
   innovative teaching method of the ``flipped classroom{''} in which the
   student prepares the lesson as a homework, and then in the classroom
   develop collaborative and debate activities on the topic previously
   studied in autonomy.},

Abstract = {Purpose: The aim of this study was to confirm the applicability of
   YouTube as a delivery platform of lecture videos for dental students and
   to assess their learning attitudes towards the flipped classroom model.
   Methods: Learning experiences after using the YouTube platform to
   deliver preliminary video lectures in a flipped classroom were assessed
   by 69 second-year students (52 males, 17 females) at Dankook University
   College of Dentistry, Korea, who attended periodontology lectures during
   2 consecutive semesters of the 2016 academic year. The instructor
   uploaded the lecture videos to YouTube before each class. At the end of
   the second semester, thc students were surveyed using a questionnaire
   devised by the authors. Results: Of the students, 53 (76.8\%) always
   watched the lecture before the class, 48 (69.6\%) t sec their
   smartphones, and 66 (95.7\%) stated that they watched the lectures at
   home. The majority of the students replied that the video lectures were
   easier to understand than face to face lectures (82.6\%) and that they
   would like to view the videos again after graduation (73.9\%).
   Conclusion: Our results indicate that YouTube is an applicable platform
   to deliver video lectures and to expose students to increased learning
   opportunities.},

Abstract = {Varying pedagogical approaches of undergraduate medical education are
   utilized in clerkships to supplement bedside teaching. The flipped
   classroom mode, in which self-paced study precedes the in-person
   session, is often used in pre-clinical education. This shift allows time
   with the instructor to focus on guided application of pre-learned
   concepts. At our institution, the Internal Medicine Clerkship Infectious
   Diseases lecture was substituted to a flipped classroom with two
   pre-learning videos. Student satisfaction scores were higher for the
   flipped classroom and comments were more negative for the traditional
   lecture. This suggests that senior medical students favor flipped
   classroom pedagogy despite pre-learning requirements.},

Abstract = {The objective of this study is to gain information taken from an
   exploratory experiment, which was carried out in an action-research
   framework, in the Primary Education Degree of the University of Malaga.
   In this experiment, the flipped classroom model is used in statistical
   education in order to show that self-regulation, in the
   teaching-learning process can be developed to the point of
   metacognition. It is intended to involve students in the learning
   process, promote their ability to analyse data and statistical
   reasoning, and allow them to develop critical thinking skills. It takes
   on an active methodological approach, and bases itself on personal
   autonomy and self-regulation. According to the results observed, the
   more instrumental mathematical activities can be left outside the
   classroom, thereby favouring the development of much more functional and
   formative tasks within the classroom.},

Abstract = {Flipped classrooms are gaining popularity, especially in psychology
   statistics courses. However, not all courses lend themselves to a fully
   flipped design, and some instructors might not want to commit to
   flipping every class. We tested the effectiveness of flipping just one
   component (a module on junk science) of a large methods course. We
   compared two sections, one in a traditional format (n = 128) and the
   other in a flipped format (n = 139), based on students' academic
   performance and attitudes toward the class structure. Compared to
   students in the traditional lecture section, students in the flipped
   section performed significantly better on a quiz tied to the lecture
   content and rated their enjoyment of the exercise as higher. These
   findings demonstrate the utility of using partial flipped classroom
   techniques with large classes.},

Abstract = {This study investigates the possibility of utilizing online learning
   data to design face-to-face activities in a flipped classroom. We focus
   on heterogeneous group formation for effective collaborative learning.
   Fifty-three undergraduate students (18 males, 35 females) participated
   in this study, and 8 students (3 males, 5 females) among them joined
   post-study interviews. For this study, a total of 6 student
   characteristics were used: three demographic characteristics obtained
   from a simple survey and three academic characteristics captured from
   online learning data. We define three demographic group heterogeneity
   variables and three academic group heterogeneity variables, where each
   variable is calculated using the corresponding student characteristic.
   In this way, each heterogeneity variables represents a degree of
   diversity within the group. Then, a two-stage hierarchical regression
   analysis was conducted to identify the significant group heterogeneity
   variables that influence face-to-face group achievement. The results
   show that the academic group heterogeneity variables, which were derived
   from the online learning data, accounted for a significant proportion of
   the variance in the group achievement when the demographic group
   heterogeneity variables were controlled. The interviews also reveal that
   the academic group heterogeneity indeed affected group interaction and
   learning outcome. These findings highlight that online learning data can
   be utilized to obtain relevant information for effective face-to-face
   activity design in a flipped classroom. Based on the results, we discuss
   the advantages of this data utilization approach and other implications
   for face-to-face activity design.},

Abstract = {Teaching the nursing process to undergraduate nursing students is
   challenging, as they face difficulties related to collecting patient
   data and struggle to understand the relationship between the collected
   data and the patient's needs. This study employed a descriptive design
   with a qualitative content analysis approach to investigate nursing
   students' experiences of learning the nursing process through a mixed
   teaching method using a flipped classroom and a digital unfolding case.
   Their experiences with the applied teaching method and its influence on
   their learning outcomes were shared through their participation in two

Title = {Engaging students in education for sustainable development: The benefits
   of active learning, reflective practices and flipped classroom
   pedagogies},
Journal = {JOURNAL OF CLEANER PRODUCTION},
Year = {2021},
Volume = {325},
Month = {NOV 20},
Abstract = {Effective Education for Sustainable Development (ESD) requires
   appropriate pedagogies that engage learners in transformative learning.
   These pedagogies include reflective and active learning, involving
   experiential, collaborative and learner-centred activities. This paper
   discusses student experiences and perceptions of an interdisciplinary
   social science ESD course at a UK university that incorporated
   reflective and active learning by using a `flipped classroom' (FC)
   design and innovative assessments. FC creates time in class for
   reflective and active learning by moving content acquisition to
   pre-class study. Adoption of the flipped classroom in social sciences is
   rare and literature on use of FC for ESD is very scarce; hence this
   paper offers valuable insights into the design of a flipped social
   science ESD course, and participants' responses. Results of two surveys
   demonstrate very positive student perceptions of the course, and
   illustrate several benefits of the FC design. Over 90\% of respondents
   agreed that in-class active learning exercises made the classes more
   engaging and the material more memorable than usual, offering useful
   opportunities to put information/ learning into practice, with most
   students expressing strong agreement. In-class mini-lectures were
   nevertheless also appreciated, as were reflective practices. A large
   majority of the students considered the workload reasonable. Findings
   also reveal the importance of incentivising pre-class preparation using
   graded assessments such as quizzes, which additionally helped students
   understand/remember content, and gave confidence about contributing in
   class. It is clear that the active and reflective learning that FC
   facilitates engages students in ESD. The paper concludes by offering
   recommendations for successfully implementing this approach.},

Abstract = {For higher education, the question of how in-class activities can be
   supported in large lectures is of great relevance. This paper suggests a
   gamified flipped classroom approach to address this challenge. In an
   experimental study, N = 205 educational science students performed
   either gamified in-class activities using a gamified quiz with points
   and a team leaderboard, or non-gamified in-class activities using
   exercise sheets. In line with the theory of gamified learning, the
   results show a positive indirect effect of gamification on
   application-oriented knowledge that is mediated by learning process
   performance. Furthermore, based on a self-determination theory
   framework, the results show positive effects of gamified in-class
   activities on intrinsic motivation and social relatedness, but no
   significant effect on competence need satisfaction. The study provides
   insights into a particular casual construct of game design elements
   (points and team leaderboards) triggering specific mechanisms (immediate
   task-level feedback and team competition) affecting a mediator (learning
   process performance) that in turn affects a learning outcome
   (application-oriented knowledge).},

Abstract = {Currently, there are several methodological models that have broken into
   different disciplines of knowledge with the aim of making the
   teaching/learning process more dynamic, active and participatory for
   students. This is the case of Flipped Classroom, which is based on a
   mixed approach between e-learning and face-to-face teaching, as well as
   gamification, which bases its didactic principles on the recreational
   components of the games. Within this context, the aim of this research
   is to observe what effect the application of Flipped Classroom and
   gamification has in the development of motivation, autonomy and
   self-regulation towards learning through a didactic unit on healthy
   habits and diet in 202 students of 6th grade of Primary School from four
   different schools (public and state-subsidized) in the city of Granada
   (Spain). For this purpose, a methodological design was used with
   pre-test and post-test to check the effects of the experience on the
   students. The findings obtained showed that the application of these
   methods promoted an increase in students' motivation, as well as in
   their autonomy and self-regulation when facing the contents of the
   subject. For this reason, it is advocated that there is a need to
   continue promoting a quality and innovative educational practice
   according to the figure of the student today.},

Abstract = {This article reports on a case study of adopting innovative strategies
   to bridge in- and out-of-class activities in a flipped classroom to
   enhance students' mathematics learning in a technology-rich learning
   environment on the topic of `Points, Angles, Lines and Planes'. A class
   with 37 students in Grade 9 using English as a medium of instruction
   participated in this study. The strategies adopted in the flipped
   classroom were: a 5-D pedagogical framework of the flipped classroom,
   varied ways of teacher facilitation and interaction with students in and
   beyond the classroom, and technology use both in and out of class. Both
   qualitative and quantitative data were collected and analysed. The
   research findings show that the innovative strategies adopted in this
   study were generally conducive to enhancing students' mathematics
   learning in the flipped classroom. The findings contribute to the
   literature of flipped classroom pedagogical design and practices.},

Abstract = {The inverted classroom or Flipped Classroom, is a pedagogical model that
   raises the possibility of transferring part of the teaching and learning
   process outside the classroom, in order to use class time for the
   development of cognitive processes of greater complexity and favor
   learning significant. The application of this model has grown in recent
   years in various educational contexts. In this text a bibliographic
   review is presented, whose objective has been to analyze the
   implementations that have been carried out in Primary Education, but
   also to highlight the characteristics of those that have obtained better
   results for the future design of interventions based on scientific
   evidence. From the inclusion and exclusion criteria, 19 articles were
   obtained for analysis. The results have shown that there are few
   publications focused on the Primary Education stage. Most are
   implemented in the science area with small samples and experimental
   design with pre-test and post-test. The majority agree on improving the
   motivation and responsibility of students in their learning.},

Abstract = {This study examines the effects of a flipped classroom in a technology
   integration course for pre-service teachers. In total, 79 students were
   randomly assigned into a flipped classroom or a traditional classroom
   group and given three multimedia production tasks. Students in the
   flipped group reviewed an e-book for lessons on multimedia productions
   before a face-to-face class and participated in interactive learning
   activities in class while the control group students had traditional
   computer lab instructions with no pre-assignment tasks. Student
   performance in three learning tasks was compared between groups. The
   study results revealed that the flipped classroom group performed the
   learning tasks significantly better than the control group and that the
   image production task was the most challenging among the three tasks.
   The effects of the flipped classroom were most evident in the image
   production task. The student perception survey also showed positive
   attitudes towards the flipped classroom among the experimental group.},

Abstract = {One response to a pedagogical shift towards student-centred and active
   learning approaches to promote student learning in STEM is the flipped
   classroom. However, there has been inconsistency in the design and
   implementation of the flipped classroom and its impact on student
   learning. This review systematically analysed 30 empirical studies on
   flipped classrooms in formal, K-16 science and maths classrooms to
   understand theoretical underpinnings leading to different approaches to
   flipped classrooms and the impact of flipped classrooms on student
   learning in science and maths classrooms. The selected studies were
   qualitatively analysed, and the results showed that: (1) there is more
   published literature on the flipped classroom identified in
   post-secondary science and mathematics classrooms, (2) the design of the
   flipped classroom is rarely grounded in theoretical frameworks
   especially in science classrooms, and (3) the flipped classroom has an
   overall positive effect on students' science and maths learning. This
   study highlights the importance of using explicit theoretical frameworks
   aligned with contemporary learning theories to guide the design,
   implementation, and evaluation of the flipped classroom. Additionally,
   there is a need for future research to utilise design-based
   methodologies to maximise the positive impact of the flipped classroom
   on student learning.},

Abstract = {The new teaching techniques based on avant-garde methodologies aimed at
   enhancing student learning are being promoted at all levels of education
   for a few decades, integrating the significant advances that are taking
   place in different scientific disciplines, including from the areas of
   psychology basic and group up to the most effective techniques of talent
   management and organizations.
   In the present work, we review the teaching-learning techniques and
   methodologies that we consider most efficient at present, with examples
   that show their suitability for current teaching. The application and
   effectiveness of coaching and gamification techniques and the innovative
   pedagogical strategies integrated in the so-called flipped classroom are
   analyzed. The results obtained with the application of these
   methodologies allow us to conclude that the analyzed pedagogical tools
   are ideal to increase the learning capacities and personal development
   of the students.},

Abstract = {The use of flipped classrooms has gained momentum and involves the
   instructor replacing the passive reception of material found in common
   lectures, so class time may be used for hands-on practical application,
   discussion, or assignments. The purpose of this paper is to explore
   students' perceptions of a flipped therapeutic modality course. Focus
   group interviews were conducted with sixteen participants (14 female, 2
   male) who completed a therapeutic modality course. Data were collected
   through 4 focus group interviews, which were digitally recorded and
   transcribed. Data were analyzed to uncover dominant themes-first by
   organizing the data, then summarizing data into codes, and finally
   interpreting. Credibility was secured through peer review, member
   checks, and investigator triangulation. The analysis resulted in three
   common themes: the flipped classroom (1) was perceived as valuable by
   students, (2) led to active participation in class, and (3) helped
   students feel better prepared for the class. Athletic training students,
   particularly in a flipped therapeutic modality course, valued this
   pedagogical approach.},

Volume = {34},

Abstract = {Healthcare environments have increased in complexity over the last 30
   years. However, educational methods to prepare nurses have remained
   virtually unchanged. To prepare nurses to practice in today's complex
   practice environment, there are calls for change and transformation in
   how nursing education is implemented. This transformation requires nurse
   educators to shift their epistemic beliefs about teaching and learning
   by considering theories that promote effective learning. An innovative
   method being used in nursing education is the Flipped Classroom Method
   (FCM). The FCM is a teaching strategy that encourages critical thinking
   and application of knowledge obtained outside of the classroom to
   real-world situations and problems within the classroom. This paper
   presents a preliminary framework synthesized from multiple theories
   including andragogy, constructivism, self-efficacy, and diffusion of
   innovations. The purpose of this preliminary framework is to support the
   nurse educator's reflections about the learner, their abilities to
   implement the FCM and to synthesize theoretical constructs to implement
   the FCM.},

Title = {A Trial and Perceptions Assessment of APP-Based Flipped Classroom
   Teaching Model for Medical Students in Learning Immunology in China},
Journal = {EDUCATION SCIENCES},

Abstract = {The application-based flipped classroom (APP-FC) is an innovative
   teaching-learning model that has not been applied and assessed in basic
   medical curricula teaching in China. The aim of this investigation is to
   assess students' perceptions to the APP-based flipped classroom (APP-FC)
   teaching model in an immunology course. The data of this study were
   collected from second-year medical students (n = 92) at Lanzhou
   University. One class (n = 50), as a control group, was offered
   lecture-based learning (LBL), while the other class (n = 42), as the
   APP-FC group, was given lecture-based instruction and the APP-FC
   teaching model during September-November 2017. Afterward, the
   perceptions of students on APP-FC teaching model were evaluated using
   questionnaires. Students responded that APP-FC improves their motivation
   (83\%) and interest in learning immunology (81\%), as well as their
   self-directed learning skills (81\%). Compared to the traditional
   lecture-based instruction, the APP-FC noticeably improved students'
   motivation in learning (P = 0.011), self-directed learn skills (P =
   0.001), memory abilities (P = 0.009), and problem-solving abilities (P =
   0.010). Most medical students' scores (60\%) in the final examination
   were more than 80 points after implementing an APP-FC model as compared
   to the control group (40\%). The majority of students (70\%) preferred
   the APP-FC teaching approach over traditional lecture-based pedagogy.
   The implementation of the APP-FC teaching model could improve students'
   learning motivation, self-directed learn skills, and problem-solving
   abilities, which is a preferable teaching model for medical immunology
   courses in China.},

Title = {Gamifying the flipped classroom: how to motivate Chinese ESL learners?},
Journal = {INNOVATION IN LANGUAGE LEARNING AND TEACHING},

Pages = {421-435},
Abstract = {Flipped classrooms emphasise a learner-centred and results-oriented
   approach. They have been widely adopted in recent years, to enhance the
   effectiveness of student learning and encourage students to understand
   and apply new information. This approach is also regarded as a type of
   blended learning, given that tutors decide on the pre-class work, which
   is often characterised by online materials, and in-class time is devoted
   to collaborative tasks. This paper proposes teaching English narrative
   genres by combining digital drawing with active learning approaches -
   storymaking and storytelling. It also examines Hong Kong university
   students' perceptions of gamified flipped classrooms, as well as their
   understanding of the narrative concepts taught. Based on a combination
   of surveys, narrative writing scores, and focus group interviews, this
   study found that participants regarded the group-based game task as more
   effective than the group discussion task. The collaborative group-based
   game fostered a positive classroom atmosphere, served as a review
   session that allowed students to identify areas for improvement and
   prepare for the exit examination, and reduced their anxiety and
   reticence toward using English. These findings confirmed previous
   research findings that students' behavioural, cognitive, and
   motivational engagement could be enhanced through a gamified flipped
   classroom. Pedagogical implications for ESL teachers were also
   discussed.},

Abstract = {In previous years students in the advanced bachelor course Developmental
   Psychopathology often failed examination questions where they had to
   apply theoretical knowledge to realistic clinical issues. Therefore, a
   new teaching method was implemented to improve students' understanding.
   Flipped classroom (FC) and team-based learning (TBL) techniques were
   implemented, using six challenging authentic assignments. This study
   describes how these adaptations went along with student performance for
   three subsequent cohorts, where each cohort received more FC and TBL
   elements. In cohort 2 a semi-experimental design was used to study the
   effects of specific techniques. Moreover, it was investigated if
   students considered this approach useful, and whether it changed their
   learning strategy. Findings suggest that both FC and TBL techniques
   contributed to a higher level of understanding, particularly if group
   work took place in supervised tutorials with teacher feedback and
   discussion. Further research is required to investigate which specific
   elements were most effective.},

Abstract = {The flipped classroom had shown positive effects on academic achievement
   and student satisfaction, but require a higher level of self-regulation
   from students. There are few studies about flipped classroom
   characteristics that could help to improve self-regulation. This study
   assess the influence of choice in the goal setting process of students
   and their perception of clear goals while learning in flipped classes,
   in comparison with lecture based courses in a university-level
   programming class (n = 299). A method based in the progression mechanism
   of role playing games is used to help the goal setting process of
   students in the flipped classroom. Students in flipped classes perceived
   higher levels of choice in comparison with students in lecture based
   courses. The effect of choice on achievement was partially mediated by
   the perception of clear goals of the students and was higher in lower
   performing students. Our results suggest that the increased perception
   of choice in the flipped classroom, and their effect in achievement,
   complement the effect of active learning in the results obtained from
   flipped classroom use. Instructional designers can use the flipped
   classroom to provide choices to help the goal setting process of
   students.},

Abstract = {Social networks and digital collaborative tools have become informal
   education laboratories. In accordance with this statement, the objective
   of this research has focused on investigating the perceptions and
   experiences of a group of students about the flipped classroom
   methodology, in combination with the use of social networks, game based
   learning and classroom response systems as learning tools, and on
   understanding how they impact on learning. The study has involved 257
   students and has been carried out following a qualitative methodology,
   using interviews, a research diary and the application called Mentimeter
   as data gathering tools. The results indicate that this methodology
   facilitates motivation, autonomy and commitment with learning.
   Furthermore, it serves to develop participation and commitment to the
   professional community and the citizenship. Also, regarding the
   learning-teaching processes, the results show an increase of autonomy,
   of the prior knowledge necessary to solve assignments and of formative
   assessment. Finally, these studies foster the reflection of one's own
   teaching practice.},

Abstract = {This paper presents a flipped classroom project carried out on the
   Primary Education degree in the University of Cadiz. The initiative
   responded to the need to introduce a new way of working as students
   react with a higher level of interest and involvement to practical
   dynamics than to the traditional theory class.
   Our aim was to try and solve some of the problems that our students were
   facing, such as difficulty in maintaining their focus during a theory
   class, trying to assimilate the concepts at the same time as they take
   notes and losing the thread during the explanations because they work at
   a different rate than the rest of the group. These students would
   benefit from working with the material before the class at home and at
   their own pace, freeing up class time for collaborative, practical
   activities to exemplify and expand the concepts.
   We analyse the key aspects of this methodology, paying special attention
   to the advantages and difficulties we faced during its implementation.},

   to Millennials},
Journal = {JOURNAL OF TEACHING IN INTERNATIONAL BUSINESS},

Volume = {30},
Number = {2},
Pages = {102-124},
Abstract = {A general direction in higher education has been to move away from
   lecture-based instruction toward more active and student-centered
   learning. Even though much research has been done regarding
   digitalization in instructional contexts, there is not much research on
   applying a flipped classroom (K) approach to teaching cross-cultural
   communication in the international business field. Therefore, this study
   applies an FC pedagogical approach and the principles of sales
   communication education (SCE) to teaching cross-cultural communication
   to millennial international business and sales management students. Data
   regarding student satisfaction, students' perceptions of elements of an
   FC course, as well as learning outcomes and meaningful learning
   experiences were collected using a mixed methods approach. The results
   show that overall student satisfaction with the FC course was very high.
   The millennials found the FC course to be a highly enjoyable way of
   learning cross-cultural communication. They particularly valued the
   pre-learning materials (video lectures), interactive in-class meetings
   and the teacher's supportive actions. The learning outcomes included
   cognitive, behavioral and affective learning. Meaningful learning
   experiences included interviewing a CEO or international seller and
   engaging in practical negotiation exercises. Pedagogical improvements,
   theoretical implications and directions for future research are
   discussed.},

Title = {Teaching ``Shock Pathophysiology{''} by Flipped Classroom: Views and
   Perspectives},
Journal = {JOURNAL OF MEDICAL EDUCATION AND CURRICULAR DEVELOPMENT},
Year = {2020},
Volume = {7},
Month = {FEB},
Abstract = {Flipped classroom (FCR) is an active learning pedagogical method in
   which the students prepare prior to class using different modalities,
   for example, reading materials and videos, and afterward spend the time
   in class discussing the content and reinforcing the concepts. We chose
   to replace one problem-based case on ``Shock{''} with flipped-style
   teaching in the respiration circulation module of a private medical
   university. Our objective was to use the clinical presentation of
   ``Shock{''} to open a window to interrelate basic science concepts of
   cardiovascular physiology and pathology. It aimed to merge the
   case-based discussion with small-group discussions in the form of FCR
   activity. The qualitative study gives an overview of comments of
   facilitators, observers, and leadership of the Department and University
   obtained during focus group discussions and in-depth interviews.
   Thematic analysis of responses emphasized the importance of FCR as an
   effective teaching learning modality, which can be made more effective
   by careful selection of topic and provision of facilities to support
   technology-enhanced learning. The discussions with facilitators,
   observers, and leadership revealed its usefulness through student's
   engagement and increased participation to build learning of the key
   concepts. Student satisfaction in these activities can be enhanced by
   construction of knowledge acquired in non-face-to-face component with
   substantial pre-reading materials, videos, peer discussions, quizzes,
   and prompt feedback.},

Abstract = {The purpose of the study is to explore student-content,
   student-interface, student-instructor, and student-student interactions
   in a flipped classroom (FC)-based undergraduate engineering course using
   the transactional distance (TD) theory. Understanding student
   interactions that occur in and out of the classroom to reduce the TD can
   help one design and develop high-quality FC-based courses and, thus,
   produce better learning outcomes and teaching experiences. A
   mixed-methods case study was implemented in a Probability and Statistics
   course, and 37 undergraduate students from a developing university's
   faculty of engineering participated in the study. Data were collected
   via an anonymous online survey and focus group interviews. The initial
   findings indicated that the FC approach facilitated the students'
   learning process and increased their interest in the course.
   Furthermore, the students found favorable student-content,
   student-instructor, student-interface, and student-student interactions.
   Based on the findings, all interaction types and their relationship with
   each other in the scope of the FC approach were discussed.
   Recommendations for reducing the TD include preparing videos that are
   understandable and comprehensive enough to be studied by students,
   provision of sufficient support, and positive attitude to students by
   instructors, encouraging collaboration among students, and utilizing

Title = {The effect of the flipped classroom model on Iranian English foreign
   language learners: Engagement and motivation in English language grammar},

Abstract = {Flipped Learning is a rather new approach to teaching. In this approach,
   the place of teacher's lectures in the classroom and homework
   assignments are exchanged to enhance active learning, engagement, and
   motivation. The aim of this research was to determine the effect of the
   flipped classroom model on intermediate and upper-intermediate learners'
   engagement and motivation in learning English grammar. In the current
   study, quasi-experimental research was used. This research was conducted
   within the English course for six weeks' period in the summer term in
   2019. Three hundred and sixty English learners have been chosen through
   multi-stage cluster sampling from four different institutes. They were
   randomly assigned to control and experimental groups. Data were
   collected both pre-test and post-test. Among 50 grammar videos, eight
   grammar contents based on CVI (content validity index) CVR (content
   validity ratio) (0.42, 0.79) were selected. Questionnaires' validity was
   checked by some experts and their reliability was checked through
   Cronbach's Alpha test. Questionnaires were Hermense (motivation,
   proportional to = 0.97) and SEI (engagement, proportional to = 0.93). In
   the current study, descriptive statistics, and ANCOVA tests were used in
   the analysis of the quantitative data. Results indicated that learners
   in the flipped classroom performed better than learners in the
   traditional class. It was concluded that there was a significant
   difference between the pre-test and post-test scores of the experimental
   group whereas there was no significant difference between the pre-test
   and post-test scores of the control group. The findings of this study
   carry important implications for foreign language syllabus designers,
   language instructors, etc.},

Title = {``Flipping or flapping?{''} investigating engineering students'
   experience in flipped classrooms},
Journal = {ON THE HORIZON},

Volume = {26},

Pages = {307-316},
Abstract = {Purpose - This study has explored the flipped classroom model in a
   private university in Malaysia. It aims to present a flipped classroom
   intervention for engineering education innovation.
   Design/methodology/approach - The research (1) revisited prominent
   educational theories for a flipping or flapping pedagogy, (2)
   implemented and explored the flipped classroom experiences in one
   engineering subject using the action inquiry method with thematic
   analysis and (3) reflectively evaluated both students' and educators'
   ``flipping or flapping experience{''}.
   Findings - The responses of the research participants are analysed and
   used to develop the flipping or flapping classroom principles and an
   ideal flipped classroom model. From passive lectures to active learning
   with collaborative discourse and reflective communication, flipping the
   classroom can offer a seamless learning experience.
   Research limitations/implications - The flipped classroom model can
   provide good reference for other educational researchers who intended to
   conduct a flipped classroom. However, the small sample size with
   qualitative method and thematic analysis useds led to considerable
   theoretical development, but it may not achieve the validity standards
   to generalise the findings. Further empirical investigation with a
   systematic controlled group is recommended for future work across
   disciplines for extrapolation.
   Originality/value - This is a genuine case study with an identified
   innovative teaching need to investigate how flipped classrooms can be
   enabled and enhanced in engineering education innovation.},

Abstract = {The Flipped classroom (FC) model has come into widespread use in recent
   years. However, there are few studies showing the improvement of
   academic results with the implementation of this model, particularly in
   the field of Physical Education and, even more specifically, in Primary
   Education. The main goal of this research, which is focused on the third
   cycle of Primary Education (fifth and sixth grades), is to compare the
   results of a didactic proposal for the teaching of Korfball via an FC
   model with those of another group (control). Data were collected with
   three instruments and at three points in the academic term. Results show
   significant differences in Korfball performance and, more specifically,
   in the rules and the application of game strategy during game play, when
   students with FC scored higher. In terms of gender, Korfball seems to
   minimize the differences in the results of assessment between boys and
   girls. This study could be useful for teachers wishing to implement new
   proposals in the Physical Education classroom and, additionally, for
   researchers interested in studying of the benefits of FC and the
   application of Korfball in Primary Education.},

Abstract = {The nascent recognition of computing in curriculum across countries is
   also accompanied by several pedagogic inefficiencies especially
   concerning insufficient time available for teacher-student interaction.
   In this paper, a flipped classroom concept was identified as an
   effective approach to teaching students at various levels in the
   academia including Higher Education. Preparing the pre-class content and
   considering the format used to deliver it has not gained much
   consideration. There are several ways in which this content could be
   provided to students to prepare them before an in-class activity where a
   flipped-classroom approach can be implemented. The present study
   analyzed the success of the flipped classroom concept based on a
   comparative analysis of the two types of flipped classroom pre-class
   content delivery methods: online videos and online PowerPoint slides.
   Evaluation was performed using paired T-test. The results show that the
   two approaches have significantly different means and huge differences
   between them. The students preferred online videos to online PowerPoint
   (ppt) methods underlining the importance of the proposed flipped
   classroom approach.},

Abstract = {The work analyzes the theoretical guidelines of the Flipped Classroom
   methodology and presents as its objective the proposal of a methodology.
   A mixed investigation is proposed, based on the theoretical review of
   works that have contributed to its development, the use of
   analysis-synthesis methods; induction-deduction and a conceptual map is
   obtained that summarizes a proposal for its application and a set of
   characteristics that systematize its advantages and limitations. It is
   applied to an experimental group and it is compared with a control group
   in the Natural Science subject of fourth grade at the Guillermo
   Arosemena Colonel school. In the experimental group, the acquisition of
   competences by the students stands out, such as: autonomy, ability to
   learn to learn and development of teamwork with the application of the
   Spearman Correlation test; as well as better results in the teaching
   -learning process. Similarly, a survey is applied to the parents, proven
   to be reliable and valid, which allows the use of the Iadov test and the
   Net Promoter Score with results that show satisfaction, feasibility of
   application and willingness to recommend.},

Abstract = {This work evaluates an educational proposal, based on the Flipped
   Classroom principles, implemented in online learning during the lockdown
   caused by Covid-19 pandemic. The proposal was implemented in a
   Portuguese secondary school class and combines asynchronous classes
   (ASC) with synchronous classes (SC). We collected data using
   quantitative and qualitative methods, to characterise the learning
   environment, and its influence on the students' engagement. The
   integrated analysis of the data reveals that the proposal created an
   adequate learning environment, organised, and supported by a robust
   social presence of the teacher. The design of the ASC enhanced
   student-content interactions leading to high rates of commitment to the
   tasks, which ensured an efficient preparation of the ASC. The SC
   division into learning episodes allowed us to understand the influence
   of episode design on the interaction patterns developed. The dynamic and
   interactive approaches of SC allowed the development of subject contents
   initiated in ASC. Despite the design of some episodes it has allowed
   measurable improvements in the number of student-student interactions it
   has also conditioned the collaborative construction of knowledge based
   on research processes.},

Abstract = {In this study, through using the flipped classroom and cooperative
   learning methods both together and separately, this study examines the
   changes in the motivation and academic achievement levels of 4th-grade
   students in primary school. Three experimental groups and one control
   group were used in the research. As a result of this work, the flipped
   classroom, the cooperative learning method in the flipped classroom
   environment and the cooperative learning method used separately achieved
   both a positive and significant effect on the students' levels of
   academic achievement and motivation in both the pre-experiment and
   post-experiment groups, when compared with the control group. At the end
   of this study, we've provided recommendations on how to use the flipped
   classroom and cooperative learning methods, both together and
   separately.},

   (Mean = 14.53, S.D. = 0.94) than the students who studied through normal
   model (Mean = 12.90, S.D. = 1.91), 3) the students who had studied
   through model had higher quality of creative innovation (Mean = 14.86,
   S.D. = 1.62) than the students who studied through normal model (Mean =
   12.90, S.D. = 1.91).},

Abstract = {The success of the flipped classroom (FC) is effectively reliant on the
   level of student engagement with the preparatory activities prior to
   attending face-to-face teaching sessions. Information about the nature
   and level of student engagement with these activities can help
   instructors make informed decisions regarding how to best support
   student learning. Despite the comprehensive data collection enabled by
   the increasing presence of education technologies, few studies have used
   these data to investigate the range of strategies students employ in FC
   models. This study addresses this deficit by proposing an analytical
   approach that allows for exploring, first, the strategies students use
   to interact with online preparation activities; and, second, evolution
   of those strategies over the duration of a course delivered with a FC
   pedagogy. The proposed approach identified eight learning strategies and
   six trajectories of strategy change over the duration of the course,
   with statistically significant effects of strategy change trajectories
   on academic performance.},

Abstract = {Introduction The flipped classroom (FC) format involves the student
   reviewing the theoretical subject matter through material provided prior
   to a face-to-face teaching session. The intention is that because the
   student is familiar with the material, they will derive more from the
   tutor contact time. This format has been shown to increase student
   satisfaction, performance and cognitive development, and delivers better
   academic attainment.
   Method The present paper describes the transition from a traditional
   lecture-based approach to a blended FC format in the delivery of the
   application of dental materials and biomaterials course at a UK dental
   school during the academic year 2019/2020, and compares student feedback
   before and after the transition.
   Results The formal and informal feedback received from students after
   the change was entirely positive.
   Discussion FC shows great promise as an andragogic tool in a clinical
   discipline, but further quantitative research is required, especially in
   respect to measuring academic attainment.},

Title = {Supporting Intensive Continuous Assessment With BeA in a Flipped
   Classroom Experience},
Journal = {IEEE ACCESS},

Volume = {7},

Abstract = {This paper presents the changes performed in a university course to
   adopt European Higher Education Area principles taking advantage of new
   technologies and educational approaches. Particularly, a Flipped
   Classroom model that also involves an Intensive Continuous Assessment
   approach is adopted, moving the presentation of theoretical contents to
   videos that can be watched outside of the classroom and using the
   classroom face-to-face time to provide explanations, problem solving and
   to perform assessment activities every week. A main part of innovation
   in the experience comes from the use of an online tool (BeA Blended
   e-Assessment) that facilitates the assessment and reviewing of
   paper-based exams. This tool supports teachers in assessment tasks, that
   can be performed in a faster, simpler, more transparent and less
   error-prone way. The paper shows the results of an experience involving
   a control group and an experimentation group, in which this new approach
   and tool have been applied. The results obtained demonstrate the
   effectiveness of both proposals. In conjunction, the paper describes how
   a traditional university course based on lectures can be successfully
   adapted to a more innovative approach based on the principles of active
   learning and accountability thanks to the use of our blended
   e-Assessment tool.},

Abstract = {The acquisition of a second language constitutes a fundamental aspect of
   globalized society in the 21st century. The learning of the English
   language is promoted through the national public policy of education. In
   this context, the objective of the study was to describe the students'
   perception about the implementation of the flipped classroom methodology
   in a communicative English course. The study was carried out with
   undergraduate students from Architecture and Civil Chemical Engineering
   careers. The study was descriptive with a cross-sectional design, and an
   intentional non-probabilistic sample. A questionnaire was designed and
   validated through expert judgment. It considered three dimensions:
   learning before class, learning in the classroom, and assessing the
   methodology. The data were analyzed using descriptive statistics. The
   results show that students value that they can watch the content videos
   and they can review them prior to the face-to-face class. Also, the
   students perceived that the teacher/student roles changed in the class.
   The teacher became a guide and facilitator and students became more
   active in their own learning process.},

Title = {Flipped Classroom and Aronson's Puzzle: a combined evaluation in the
   master's degree in pre universitary teaching},
Journal = {EDUCATION IN THE KNOWLEDGE SOCIETY},
Year = {2021},

Month = {APR 28},
Abstract = {This article presents a double evaluation carried out in the subject
   Didactics of Computer Science and Technology, corresponding to the
   Master's degree teacher training in secondary education, baccalaureate,
   vocational training and languages taught by Universidad Rey Juan Carlos.
   Students of the subject had to learn how to prepare simple web pages,
   using HTML, CSS and JavaScript programming languages. To this end,
   flipped classroom technique was used to present the necessary contents,
   combined with an adaptation of Aronson's cooperative learning puzzle
   technique, used to carry out a group practice that reflected the
   knowledge acquired. It is worth mentioning, as a complement to the two
   techniques used, the use of an adapted assessment rubric, which was
   provided to the students at the beginning of the teaching block. The
   evaluation was carried out during two consecutive academic years,
   2018/2019 and 2019/2020. There were important differences between the
   two studies: in the first study, students' previous self-assigned level
   was much higher (2.8 points as opposed to 1.4 points on a scale of 1 to
   5). The other difference, even more relevant, was that in the second
   year all teaching was done at home, in a non-attendance format, on a
   mandatory basis, due to the period of confinement decreed by the state
   of alarm at that moment, because of the pandemic caused by the
   SARS-CoV-2 virus, popularly known as coronavirus. It is remarkable that,
   despite these differences, the students expressed their satisfaction
   with the learning acquired and with the tasks performed in both cases.
   The techniques used were well-appreciated, in first year more than in
   the second, and especially flipped classroom. Scores obtained were, in
   addition, always very relevant.},

Abstract = {Background: Educators face the ongoing difficulty of managing finite
   class time and limited instructor-student interactions to balance
   discourse and active learning. Complicating this is the growing
   expectation to incorporate technology into nursing curriculum. This
   study explored the differences of the traditional classroom lecture (TL)
   with the flipped classroom (FC) format and the effects on higher-order
   thinking. Method: A content analysis was performed on previous work.
   Concept maps were used to evaluate data from transcripts of
   undergraduate nursing students' case study discussions in either a TL or
   FC format. Results: FC groups had a more complex concept map morphology
   and identified more subcategories and links. They exhibited a greater
   number of higher-order thinking concepts compared with the TL groups.
   The emergence of discussion tangents across both the FC and the TL
   groups was unexpected. Conclusion: The FC approach enhances student
   learning and aids in the development of higher-order thinking.},

Title = {Enhancing science self-efficacy and attitudes of Pre-Service Teachers
   (PST) through a flipped classroom learning environment},
Journal = {INTERACTIVE LEARNING ENVIRONMENTS},
Abstract = {The flipped instruction methodology has increased in popularity in
   recent years. A fruitful area for flipped methodology helps to increase
   the self-efficacy and attitudes of students as a learner in their
   science course. This study investigates the effects of following a
   flipped classroom teaching methodology on Pre-Service Teachers' (PSTs)
   self-efficacy in science contents and teaching science, as well as their
   attitudes toward science. Various instruments were used to assess the
   influence of the methodology on the aforementioned variables, and the
   results indicated that significant differences were observed in the
   students' self-efficacy before and after course completion.
   Additionally, the methodology followed in the class significantly
   increased positive attitudes toward science and scientific contents,
   and, therefore, PSTs were more willing to enjoy science. Thus, a flipped
   science course can contribute to attaining science self-efficacious PSTs
   with positive attitudes that are vital to accomplishing insights and
   visions for professional and specialized developments of PSTs.},

Abstract = {The flipped classroom method stands out as one of the teaching
   methodologies with great projection for its implementation in the higher
   education stage. This method based on Information and Communication
   Technologies allows active student learning. given its rise, we must
   question what kind of influence it has on student learning. Thus, in
   this paper it was proposed as a purpose to analyze the scientific
   production on inverted classroom to check its effect on academic
   performance. Thus, it has been used a methodology of systematic review
   of the literature. Seven analysis variables were determined with
   influence on the main construct (academic performance), among them:
   sample size, subject of study, country, methodological design, data
   collection instrument, duration of studies and research results. Among
   the results obtained, we can highlight the variability of knowledge
   fields, the use of quasi-experimental design with control and
   experimental group, and pretest and posttest measures and the most used
   instrument for data collection: the test. In addition, most of the
   studies indicate the increase in academic performance in the groups
   where the inverted classroom is implemented compared to those that
   follow a traditional method. finally, the paper presents an optimistic
   framework for the implementation of the inverted classroom, since it is
   verified different benefits in student learning.},

Title = {Pre-service Teachers' Perception of Competence, Social Relatedness, and
   Autonomy in a Flipped Classroom: Effects on Learning to Notice Student
   Preconceptions},

Abstract = {Science teachers should be able to notice student preconceptions in
   order to adapt instructions to their students' needs and support the
   learning process. Noticing as a core practice of teaching should thus be
   implemented early in science teacher education. A crucial prerequisite
   for noticing is knowledge about students' preconceptions, which is an
   important element of science teachers' pedagogical content knowledge. To
   enhance pre-service teachers' pedagogical content knowledge, flipped
   classroom approaches seem especially promising as they combine a
   theoretical introduction to important didactic concepts with a direct
   application of these concepts in profession-oriented learning tasks.
   Furthermore, flipped classrooms seem to satisfy the three basic personal
   needs of experience in competence, social relatedness, and autonomy
   according to the self-determination theory of motivation, thus enhancing
   learning. This intervention study investigates the effect of a course on
   physics didactics designed according to the flipped classroom approach
   on pre-service teachers' (N = 87) learning to notice student
   preconceptions. Specifically, we analyzed how pre-service teachers'
   perception of competence, social relatedness, and autonomy during course
   participation related to their noticing abilities. We found a
   significant increase (d = 0.40) in PSTs' noticing abilities,
   operationalized as absolute number of recognized preconceptions between
   pre- and posttest. However, this increase was not mediated by PSTs'
   perception of competence, social relatedness, and autonomy.},

Abstract = {Nursing students experience physiology as a challenging subject to
   learn. A learner-centred approach could enhance their learning. This
   study explored nursing students' experiences of actively studying
   anatomy and physiology off-campus within a flipped classroom using
   various digital tools. The data from focus group interviews and
   students' reflective notes were analysed using a combination of
   systematic text condensation and activity systems analysis. In the
   students' activity system, three tensions were identified: tension
   between students' expectations and the teaching design, tension between
   a wish for more frequent attendance and being on their own and tension
   between the schedule and time needed. The use of digital tools could
   have facilitated learning and preparation for the course activities.
   However, students seemed to depend on social assistance, and they might
   not be ready to take full responsibility for studying adequately by
   themselves.},

   recognition of FC and Objective Structured Clinical Examinations (OSCE).
   Methods In the teaching of clinical skills, the students were further
   grouped into two groups- A and B (A = 37, B = 42), using a
   computer-based random digital method. group A adopted the traditional
   classroom (TC) model, and group B adopted the FC model. OSCE was used to
   assess the clinical skills of the two groups of interns. Two independent
   sample t-test was used to analyze the difference of participant's
   demographic data and OSCE scores between the two different teaching
   model. We sent FC questionnaires to group A and OSCE questionnaires to
   groups A and B. Results The score of OSCE in group B was higher than
   that in group A (P = 0.024), especially in the heart physical
   examination (P < 0.050), lung physical examination (P < 0.050), and
   abdominal physical examination (P < 0.050). The result of the FC
   questionnaires showed that regarding online courses, most students in
   group B thought watching videos was a good way to prepare for class
   (97.6\%), For offline courses, most medical interns said that it
   enhanced their learning ability (88.1\%), and they could accept this
   form of teaching (85.7\%). As for the form of OSCE questionnaires, most
   people in group A and B said that they knew more about this form of
   assessment (81.0\%), that it truly reflected the clinical ability
   (82.3\%). Conclusions FC model has shown good results in clinical skills
   training, while FC and OSCE can be further promoted in future teaching
   and assessment.},

Abstract = {The effect of the flipped classroom model (FCM) on high school students'
   science motivation and achievement in an urban public school was
   examined using a quasi-experimental pretest/posttest design. Over 4
   weeks, sixty students engaged in the FCM and 62 students engaged in the
   traditional classroom model. Motivation was measured using the Science
   Motivation Questionnaire (SMQ-II), and achievement was measured using
   the Endocrine System Unit Test (ESUT). A statistically significant
   difference in students' composite levels of motivation when engaging in
   the FCM as compared with the traditional face-to-face model was found,
   with a statistically significant difference among the self-efficacy
   subscale only. A significant difference in academic achievement was not
   found. The implications of the research and suggestions for future
   examination are discussed.},

Abstract = {The goal of this study is to evaluate the application of the flipped
   classroom (FC) format in the international studies curriculum. Previous
   research has examined the impact of the FC on students' performance,
   operationalized by test scores, and demonstrated the utility of this
   technique in the learning process. Our research goes beyond student
   performance to evaluate the impact of the FC on student class attendance
   and the development of a set of soft skills, such as teamwork, critical
   thinking, self-efficacy, academic self-concept, and perception of
   learning. In our experiment, we compare an FC with a non-flipped class
   that combines traditional lecturing with other active learning
   techniques, such as presentations, teamwork activities, and
   problem-based debates. The study finds that the FC did not have a
   substantial impact on either students' performance, attendance, or soft
   skills. The differences between the two groups were too small to
   corroborate any tendency in favor of one or the other format. For the
   most part, students performed in a similar way. This can suggest that
   the benefits of an FC format might be less when compared with other
   active learning techniques.},

Title = {Learning of paediatric dentistry with the flipped classroom model},
Journal = {EUROPEAN JOURNAL OF DENTAL EDUCATION},
Abstract = {Introduction The flipped classroom (FC) is a pedagogical model that can
   be very useful in obtaining a dentistry degree. The main objective of
   this study was to compare learning between student groups introducing FC
   in the area of paediatric dentistry at the Complutense University of
   Madrid in 2019. Materials and Methods In this study, 76 students
   enrolled for the first time in the Pediatric Dentistry programme and
   completed a questionnaire (pre-Q) regarding specific theoretical
   knowledge about pulpotomies. Subsequently, they were divided into two
   groups: group A, which had free access before the class to an
   explanatory video about the indications and techniques of pulpotomy and
   group B, which viewed the same video only one time in class. After that,
   all students completed the same questionnaire (post-Q) again and a
   survey on the degree of satisfaction about the teaching method. Results
   The differences in score between the post-Q and pre-Q in group A had a
   mean (SD) value of 3.5 (2.4) and in group B, a mean (SD) of 2.5 (2.2),
   with a p value of .07. In questions 3, 5 and 8, learning was greater in
   the experimental group (p = .007, p = .02 and p = .001, respectively).
   For 74.4\% of the students in group A, accessing the video previous to
   the class was a very useful tool. Conclusions These results suggest that
   implementing FC in paediatric dentistry classes help students to acquire
   more theoretical knowledge, which is necessary before practical
   teaching.},

Abstract = {Interest in the flipped classroom in higher education has burgeoned
   despite the literature revealing that the effects on assessment outcomes
   remain elusive. In this paper, we present the results of an empirical
   analysis designed to compare the impact on assessment outcomes of
   different approaches to the flipped classroom (didactic and
   non-didactic). Focusing on a cohort of Intermediate Economics students
   we investigated the influence of these approaches on their examination
   results by utilising an OLS (Ordinary Least Squares) regression and
   probit followed by quantile regression. Our analysis revealed small
   positive effects when students were exposed to the `non-didactic'
   flipped classroom but no effect when pre-lecture materials were used
   didactically to mimic the material given in traditional lectures. This
   study demonstrates the need for further meta-analysis and longitudinal
   studies to investigate the relationship between different forms of the
   flipped classroom and student assessment outcomes.},

Abstract = {Background: The flipped classroom is an approach to teaching with
   independent and asynchronous study of content by students and active
   learning during scheduled class times.
   Purpose: The purpose of this review was to systematically examine
   research on the use of the flipped classroom approach in health
   professions education.
   Methods: Eleven electronic databases were searched for peer-reviewed
   literature from 2005 through September 2017. Inclusion criteria for
   studies addressed health professions students and quantitative outcomes
   (quizzes, examinations, course grades).
   Results: Of the 49 articles identified, 24 met the inclusion criteria.
   The majority of studies (n = 17) noted a significant improvement in at
   least 1 student academic outcome using the flipped classroom compared
   with the traditional lecture.
   Conclusions: This systematic review of the effects of the flipped
   classroom approach for the education of health professions students did
   not reveal compelling evidence for the effectiveness of the method in
   improving academic outcomes above that of traditional classroom
   approaches.},

Abstract = {Introduction The primary objective of this study was to describe the
   incorporation of the flipped classroom model and use of real-life
   oncology patients to facilitate student learning of oral oncolytic best
   safety practices and patient counseling. The secondary objective was to
   assess the impact of the flipped classroom learning activity on
   students' perceived confidence. Methods This study was a prospective,
   single center, flipped classroom learning activity and pre/post
   assessment survey administered to third year doctor of pharmacy students
   enrolled in the Oncology Pharmacotherapy didactic elective in 2016 and
   2017. A pre/post survey was used to assess student's perceived
   confidence with oral oncolytic best practice competencies. Results Ten
   students participated in the flipped classroom learning activity and
   survey. Five students completed both the pre- and postsurvey. The
   overall change in student's mean scores for their confidence of oral
   oncolytic competencies improved significantly from 3 to 4.1 on a 6-point
   Likert Scale (p = 0.03) following the learning activity. Students
   perceived confidence in performing oral oncolytic order verification
   increased following the implementation of a flipped classroom learning
   activity and use of real-life cancer oncology patients. Conclusion This
   study describes the development and implementation of a flipped
   classroom learning activity and use of real-life patients with cancer
   that can be implemented at other institutions of higher education in a
   didactic or experiential learning environment. Additionally, this study
   demonstrated a potential benefit in student learning.},

Title = {Flipped Classroom among Minorities in the Context of Mathematics
   Learning: The Israeli Case},
Journal = {MATHEMATICS},

Abstract = {This study presents a designated flipped classroom (FC) mathematics
   environment that utilizes a unique online platform designed for Arab
   minority students in Israel. It investigates how studying in an FC
   affects conceptual understanding and motivation to study mathematics
   among Arab high school students. The study also explores the factors
   that contribute to effective learning in the FC environment.
   Participants were 75 Arab high school students in 10th and 11th grades
   who studied advanced mathematics. Each grade group was randomly divided
   into two subgroups: an FC group and a traditional classroom group
   (comparison group). Quantitative questionnaires given before and after
   the learning program served to measure students' motivation and
   conceptual understanding of the derivative and integral topics.
   Additionally, a random sample of students who studied in the FC group
   and the teacher who taught all the groups were interviewed. The study
   describes the positive effect an FC environment has on students'
   conceptual understanding, particularly for 11th graders. The
   participants mostly appreciated how the FC resulted in less lecturing in
   class. The study contributes to the literature about FC among minorities
   and contributes to national and international efforts being made to
   reduce the gap in mathematics achievements between minorities and other
   sectors.},

Abstract = {In the era of big data mining, educational data mining has become a
   principal research focus, with online education mining, such as massive
   open online courses' (MOOC) data analysis, representing an important
   source of it. Recent studies have found that learners have low passing
   rates on MOOCs. A number of studies have proposed prediction models for
   the dropout rate of learners on MOOCs. The improvement of MOOCs and the
   promotion of personalized education are the key points of online
   education. However, the selection and intervention of students with a
   tendency to drop out slows down the efficiency of teaching and increases
   the burden on teachers. This study's aim is to utilize back propagation
   neural networks and radar graphs in a flipped classroom based on MOOCs
   to predict students' future grades and to analyze the influence of
   teaching from various perspectives to support the promotion and reform
   of teaching and curriculum. Compared with the previous year, after the
   forecast and the adjustment, this year's student scores increase
   significantly.},

   their own pace, reach up to the highest level of the thinking skills of
   Bloom's taxonomy, exercise and improve their collaboration,
   communication and ICT skills. Where most of the research concentrates on
   the learning effects for the students, this paper presents the results
   of recent European research on the impact for teachers. Setting up a
   learning path for flipped classroom, is a big challenge. Together with 7
   European partners from Belgium, Italy, Bulgaria, Slovenia, Poland and
   the Netherlands, we did research on how students and teachers perceive
   the implementation of the flipped classroom model in their teaching and
   how challenging the integration of technology in their lessons is. We
   also asked about their perceptions: are the benefits worth the efforts,
   is the flipped classroom model improving their teaching skills and what
   are their needs and requirements to get succeed? We started by getting
   the teachers a flipped classroom instruction to learn the method,
   combined with a face-to-face training in Belgium, where they were
   supported to create a flipped classroom learning path for their own
   subjects and classes. Then, they implemented the method in their
   institutions for adult and higher education. The surveys were conducted
   after this try out, in all of the 7 European participating countries.
   The research results of the surveys will be presented and used to make
   recommendations that increase the chance of a successful implementation
   of the flipped classroom method. These recommendations were tested and
   evaluated during flipped classroom trainings at teacher training
   departments in Belgium and Vietnam. The qualitative test results will
   also be presented in this paper.},

Abstract = {We describe a case study of a third-year undergraduate class in
   Enterprise Education. A blended learning design in the form of a flipped
   classroom with a duration of one semester, was explored in two cohorts.
   The question was to explore how students experienced the flipped class
   for learning and how this approach presented the different presences in
   the Community of Inquiry (CoI), and its revisions. The online learning
   components represented the individual learning space, where the main
   resource was bespoke videos that replaced lectures and complemented the
   textbook and other learning material. The classroom hosted a business
   school-style seminar where students in small groups engaged in solving a
   new business case study, going through phases of developing a concept to
   presenting the group solutions to the class. It aimed at fostering
   active learning both inside and outside the class. Students participated
   in the activities to apply the theory in new cases. The teacher
   facilitated the sessions, provided direction and correction as needed.
   The research used mixed methods consisting of trace data, quantitative
   and qualitative student feedback to explore how suitable the flipped
   classroom in undergraduate education was towards developing deep
   learning. The online individual learning space yielded highly salient
   Teaching Presences, accompanied by evidence of Agency Presence,
   characterised by independent activity and personal learning preferences.
   Online videos and ICT resources helped with understanding the theory
   ahead of class meetings. Seminars in the collaborative space fostered
   deep learning of the theory, and enabled students to apply the prepared
   theory in case studies and solve problems. Integration and particularly
   Resolution in Cognitive Presence of CoI featured in the seminars, while
   Social Presence was the weakest. Suggestions are made to implement the
   flipped class principles in an online class.},

Abstract = {In recent years, many institutions have announced the significance of
   software development for countries, societies, and individuals. In
   developing software, various unpredictable problems are often
   encountered, especially in developing large-scale and complex software.
   To reduce the possibility of these problems occurring, it is important
   for students to apply software engineering technology to scientifically
   define the criteria, models, and procedures needed in the software
   development process. Therefore, it is important to cultivate students to
   learn software engineering concepts and technologies. However, since the
   course duration is limited by the semester, most teachers can only
   conduct a teacher-centered learning environment to teach theoretical
   concepts to students. Most students cannot achieve high-order thinking
   skills and apply software engineering technology to solve practical
   problems after learning in this environment. As mentioned above, the aim
   of this study is to apply an innovative pedagogy, called a flipped
   classroom, to conduct a learner-centered learning environment in a
   software engineering course. Moreover, a smart learning diagnosis system
   was developed to support this pedagogy in this course. An experiment was
   conducted on a software engineering course at a university in Taiwan to
   investigate the effectiveness of the proposed approach. The students in
   the experimental group learned with the flipped-classroom learning
   approach, while the students in the control group learned with the
   traditional-classroom learning approach. The experimental results show
   that, in comparison with the traditional-classroom learning approach,
   the proposed approach significantly improved the students' learning
   achievement, learning motivation, learning attitude, and problem solving
   ability.},

Abstract = {Multimedia principles such as segmentation, learner control, and
   modality have been proposed to ensure animated demonstrations (AD)
   effectiveness. However, several studies that apply multimedia principles
   in different learning contexts with different learners have found
   boundary conditions for several effects. This study thus aimed to
   investigate different levels of learner control, segmenting, and
   modality effects on learning and cognitive load when AD was used as the
   before-class instructions in the flipped classroom, in which the
   boundary conditions include self-pacing and sufficient learning time.
   Two experiments (low control vs. high control) were conducted with a 2 x
   2 (segmentation: nonsegmented vs. segmented; modality: narrated vs.
   captioned) between-subjects ANOVA design. A supplementary analysis
   across the two experiments was further conducted to distinguish between
   the main effects of learner control and segmentation. The findings of
   this study have important implications for the design of before-class
   instructions to enhance student engagement and understanding.},

Abstract = {The purpose of this self-study project was to examine whether or not the
   use of Problem-Based Learning (PBL) approach enhanced with Flipped
   Classroom Model (FCM) has an effect on student teachers' learning
   achievement in a Practicum course. In particular, it investigated if PBL
   enhanced with FCM had an effect on student teachers' performance in
   self-study, team interaction and collaboration, and public presentation.
   The participants were 70 student teachers divided into two groups; the
   treatment group (n = 35), and the control group (n = 35). The
   performance of student teachers was measured by a rubric consisting of
   three criteria: self-study, team interaction and collaboration, and
   public presentation. The results indicated that there was a statistical
   significant difference between the two groups of student teachers and
   this difference was in favour of student teachers who received PBL
   enhanced with FCM. Statistical significant differences were found in the
   treatment group performance of self-study and team interaction and
   collaboration. No statistical significant difference was found between
   the two groups in public presentation performance. Consequently, the
   study recommended the integration of student-centred learning methods in
   teacher education programs to train student teachers apply them in their
   future profession.},

Abstract = {This endeavor is an attempt to explore the effect of flipped classroom
   strategy (FCS) on (a) academic achievement in the computer and
   information technology course and (b) students' attitudes towards this
   strategy. The sample of the study consisted of 64 students, divided into
   two groups: experimental and control groups. Two instruments were used
   to collect the data: a test and a questionnaire. The test was used to
   measure the students' achievement and the questionnaire to measure their
   attitudes towards the FCS. The results show statistically significant
   differences at the level of 0.05 in support of the experimental group at
   all Bloom's levels. Similarly, students' positive attitude towards the
   FCS was evident. Therefore, expanding this strategy in different courses
   is highly recommended because it positively impacts students'
   achievements. Organizing workshops and designing courses that encourage
   teachers to implement the strategy in the classroom and develop their
   technical skills are also recommended.},

Abstract = {This paper reports our experience in flipping a second- year
   undergraduate course on software architecture and integration, taught in
   the second course of a Software Engineering degree. We compare the
   application of the flipped-classroom methodology with a traditional
   methodology. Our study encompasses two academic courses, in the years
   2017 and 2018, and involves a total number of 434 students and 6
   lecturers, placing this among the largest studies on flipped-classroom
   to date. The paper also reports on the production of the videos used
   with the flipped-classroom methodology, recorded by the lecturers in
   informal settings, and provides several lessons learned in this regard.
   The results of the study, backed by a solid statistical analysis of the
   data, demonstrate the suitability of the flipped-classroom methodology
   for laboratory sessions in the subject course. Among other results, our
   analysis concluded that students had on average 24 more minutes per
   session to solve in-class exercises with the flipped-classroom
   methodology; more than 70\% of the students considered that the
   quantity, duration and didactic content of the videos were (very)
   appropriate; and 9 out of every 10 students would prefer this
   methodology in the laboratory sessions of future courses rather than a
   traditional face-to-face approach.},

Abstract = {Flipped and traditional classroom models were compared in the Duke
   University Medical Center ( Durham, North Carolina) dermatology
   residency program for the 2014-2015 academic year. The residents
   participated in 12 lectures-6 traditional and 6 flipped-that were paired
   for similar content. Each lecture was followed by a survey comprised of
   10 factual questions and 10 perception questions. Generalized linear
   regression models were used to study the differences in quiz scores
   between the 2 classroom models after adjusting for other baseline
   covariates. There was not a significant difference in mean factual quiz
   scores between the two classroom models. Results indicated significant
   perception differences in favor of the flipped classroom model, such as
   participation (P<.001), enjoyment (P=.038 and P=.026), efficiency
   (P=.033), and boards (P=.050) and clinical preparedness (P=.034).},

Title = {EFL learners' metacognitive development in flipped learning: a
   comparative study},
Journal = {INTERACTIVE LEARNING ENVIRONMENTS},
Abstract = {This study adopts a qualitative method in comparing EFL students'
   development of metacognitive knowledge and metacognitive strategy use in
   a university flipped classroom, as opposed to a regular classroom
   context. A total of 8 students (4 from each class) were each interviewed
   twice, once at the beginning and again at the end of the semester, in
   semi-structured interviews. Findings show that, in the context of a
   flipped classroom, learners' metacognitive knowledge had undergone
   qualitative changes over the course of a semester. Similarly, the
   flipped classroom design had led to a more active, deeper use of
   metacognitive strategies. Finally, implications for teaching and further
   research are discussed.},

Abstract = {With the emergence of online tools in education, the search for the new
   models and approaches has gained importance. Flipped Classroom Model
   (FCM), in which online and face-to-face instructions are blended and the
   place of homework and classroom instruction is reversed, is one of the
   recent models. The purpose of this study is to investigate the
   perceptions of pre-service teachers of English in Turkey context on FCM
   and an LMS platform, Google Classroom. The participants of this study
   were 58 pre-service teachers of English enrolled at a state-run
   university in Turkey. The findings revealed that the pre-service
   teachers' perceptions on FCM were quite positive in terms of motivation,
   effectiveness, engagement and overall student satisfaction. It was also
   found that they believed that more time was required to prepare before
   the class, being prepared was something positive in terms of motivation,
   each learner had to chance to learn on his/her own pace and learning by
   doing was encouraged through more practice. As for the platform, Google
   Classroom was found to be user-friendly, particularly due to its
   features related to assignment submission and following deadlines. It
   was also observed that the participants were satisfied with the
   instructor's attitude in online platform.},

Abstract = {This study aims to examine the role of the Flipped Classroom Model (FCM)
   in the development of the basic language skills of 4th grade students in
   Turkish language lesson. In this respect, in the 4th grade Turkish
   language lesson in which the FCM was used, the views of fourth-grade
   students, their teachers, and parents related to the circumstances and
   process occurred during the implementation of the FCM in improving the
   basic language skills of students were investigated. The study was
   designed in the action research. The study was conducted with thirteen
   activities in the fourth grade Turkish language lesson and lasted nine
   weeks and 45 course hours. Data were collected from observations,
   interviews, documents, action plans, learning materials and validation
   committee meeting decisions. According to results the activities carried
   out during the implementation contributed to the development of language
   skills of the students. It was also seemed that students' various
   cognitive, affective, psychomotor and social skills developed, that
   improvements happened in terms of classroom management, and that
   behavioral problems which affect the implementation process decreased.
   In addition, students, their teachers and parents were observed to have
   positive opinions regarding the FCM and the implementation process.},

Title = {Using a lecture-oriented flipped classroom in a proof-oriented advanced
   mathematics course},
Journal = {INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF MATHEMATICAL EDUCATION IN SCIENCE AND
   TECHNOLOGY},
Abstract = {In traditional advanced mathematics lectures the instructor usually
   provides definitions, theorems, and proofs on the board rather quickly.
   The students often cannot make sense of these during the lecture as they
   are busy writing. In order to gain an understanding of the content, an
   intensive post-class processing on the basis of their notes would
   therefore be necessary for many students. However, students often do not
   post-class process lectures carefully. Furthermore, they often do not
   record the lecturer's oral explanations that are essential to make sense
   of the formal lecture content. One approach to address these problems is
   a flipped classroom, in which students come into contact with new
   content before class, while the in-class time is used for activities
   that help students make sense of it. We implemented an adaptation of
   this approach in a proof-oriented analysis course, in which the
   instructor used the in-class time to illustrate how experts in
   mathematics make sense of new definitions, theorems, and proofs, while
   keeping the lecture as the mode of teaching. In this article we describe
   this adaptation, its possible benefits for addressing students' problems
   in learning from traditional mathematics lectures, and its actual
   effects, which we investigated in an empirical study.},

Title = {The impact of flipped classrooms on student achievement in engineering

Abstract = {Background The flipped classroom has become more widely used in
   engineering education. However, a systematic and quantitative assessment
   of its achievement outcomes has not been conducted to date. Purpose To
   address this gap, we examined the findings from comparative articles
   published between 2008 and 2017 through a meta-analysis to summarize the
   overall effects of the flipped classroom on student achievement in
   engineering education. Scope/Method We searched and analyzed journal and
   conference publications on flipped classroom studies in engineering
   education in K-12 and higher education contexts. Twenty-nine comparative
   interventions were included in a meta-analysis involving 2,590 students
   exposed to flipped classroom and 2,739 students exposed to traditional
   lectures. A content analysis was also conducted to determine how the
   flipped engineering classroom benefits student learning. Conclusions The
   meta-analysis comparing these 29 traditional-flipped interventions in
   relation to student achievement showed an overall significant effect in
   favor of the flipped classroom over traditional lecturing (Hedges' g =
   0.289, 95\% CI {[}0.165, 0.414], p < .001). A moderator analysis showed
   that the effect of the flipped classroom was further enhanced when
   instructors offered a brief review at the start of face-to-face classes.
   Our qualitative findings suggest that self-paced learning and more
   problem-solving activities were the two most frequently reported
   benefits that promoted student learning. Based on quantitative and
   qualitative support, several implications are identified for future
   practice, such as offering a brief in-class review of preclass
   materials. Some recommendations for future research are also provided.},

Abstract = {Flipped classroom, as an innovative and effective approach, has been
   widely applied in language teaching and learning, but little is known
   about primary students' and teachers' perceptions of gamified flipped
   classroom. This research conducted a 1-year project on gamified flipped
   English as a foreign language classroom among 277 primary students and 8
   teachers. Data concerning students' and teachers' perceptions were
   collected by means of in-class observations, interviews, meeting
   minutes, researchers' observation logs, and teachers' and students'
   self-reflections and were analyzed according to the grounded theory and
   thematic analysis. The results showed that both students and teachers
   agreed on such advantages of gamified flipped classroom: increased
   learning motivation and engagement, developed learning skills and
   confidence, and improved learning performance and outcomes. However,
   teachers considered pre-class self-learning as an essential part of
   flipped classroom and played an important role in helping students
   remember and understand the basic knowledge so that more time was
   available in class for gamified and interactive activities that aimed to
   assist students' applying, analyzing, and evaluating of the knowledge,
   yet not all students indicated favorable attitude toward it. Such
   differences were probably related to the students' understandings of the
   flipped classroom, English proficiency levels, self-regulated learning
   skills, and ages.},

Abstract = {The flipped classroom has gained a great deal of attention in
   educational research and practice in recent years. The purposes of this
   study are to understand the relationship between students' online
   self-regulated learning (SRL) and their perceptions of learning in a
   flipped classrooms (FC), to identify possible mediators in this
   relationship, and to explain how this relationship predicts students'
   intentions to participate in an FC. Two questionnaires were used to
   gather data from 576 undergraduate or graduate students in Taiwan. The
   structural equation model showed that students' in-class interactions
   and online SRL are predictors of their perceived quality of usefulness
   of online learning activities and positive experience of FC, and these,
   in turn, associate with their intentional behaviours of participating in
   FC. While students' perceived value of interactions in physical
   classrooms directly related to their intentions to participate in FC,
   their online SRL predicts their intentions to participate in flipped
   learning only when mediated by the perceived quality of the usefulness
   of the online learning activities and positive experience of FC.},

Abstract = {While the number of studies of flipped classrooms has increased, they
   have primarily addressed the efficacy of using such an approach on
   student outcomes, often failing to account for the classroom activities
   and learning theories used to design the curriculum. This study begins
   to fill this gap in the literature by uniting the at-home video and
   in-class curricular components of the flipped classroom via design
   heuristics that empower students to critically think about mathematical
   problems individually before engaging with the task in a collective
   environment. To that end, we illustrate how elements of the
   instructional design theory of Realistic Mathematics Education and
   Culturally Responsive Pedagogy influenced the written and hidden
   curriculum and how those considerations were then experienced by the
   students as part of the enacted components of the curriculum. The
   context of the study is a 2-week classroom teaching experiment covering
   topics in trigonometry and vectors for 27 calculus students at a
   Norwegian university.},

Abstract = {Purpose: To examine student perceptions towards the flipped classroom
   approach and its impact on their learning and their course evaluation
   when compared to the traditional classroom method.
   Methods: Five classes of the pharmacoepidemiology course were delivered
   using the flipped classroom approach. Student perception towards the
   flipped teaching method was measured using a satisfaction survey.
   Measuring the impact of the flipped classroom on student learning and
   the student course evaluation was achieved by comparing the midterm
   grades and the results of the standard end-of-course evaluations with
   the previous semester's cohort.
   Results: Students' perceptions of the flipped classroom were mostly
   favourable. The course and its various components were viewed more
   favourably in the second semester than in the first semester.
   Statistically significant improvements were observed in the perception
   of the topics covered in the course (p = 0.045), fairness of the grade
   assessment (p = 0.004), and perception of course feedback (p = 0.021).
   No statistical difference was noted between the midterm examination
   scores of the first semester cohort (24.53 +/- 3.80) and the second
   semester cohort (25.15 +/- 3.00); {[}t (22.54) = 0.53, p = 0.3].
   Conclusion: This study demonstrates that using the flipped classroom
   approach for teaching pharmacoepidemiology can improve student
   satisfaction, as well as maintain their academic performance.},

Title = {The effects of flipped classroom approach in EFL teaching: Can we
   strategically use the flipped method to acquire communicative
   competence?},
Journal = {LANGUAGE TEACHING RESEARCH},
Abstract = {This study investigates the effects of the flipped classroom approach on
   five aspects of written communicative competence of learners of English
   as a foreign language (EFL): lexis, syntax, cohesion, pragmatics, and
   discourse. It experimented on two groups of Chinese undergraduates in a
   regular college English course, using a flipped learning approach on one
   group and a traditional lecture approach on the other. The results from
   a pre-test and post-test revealed that the flipped approach had
   differential effects on the aforementioned five sub-competencies. More
   specifically, the flipped group's overall performance was better than
   the control group in the post-test, indicating an overall positive role
   of the flipped approach on EFL learners' development of communicative
   competence. However, significant group differences were found only on
   the learners' lexical, cohesive, and pragmatic competencies, and not on
   their syntactical or discourse competencies. These findings thus provide
   further insights on how the flipped method might be strategically used
   to facilitate the learners' language development.},

Journal = {PLOS ONE},

Abstract = {Background Clinical procedural skills are vital components of medical
   education. Increased student intake and limited capacity of medical
   schools necessitate more efficient ways to deliver clinical skill
   teaching. This study employed a flipped classroom, peer-assisted
   learning approach to deliver clinical skill teaching. It aimed to
   determine the influence of pre-class demonstration video watching and
   in-class student-student interactions on clinical skill acquisition.
   Methods In 2017, a cohort of 205 medical students in their penultimate
   year of undergraduate medical study were recruited, and they learned bag
   mask ventilation and intravenous cannulation during this study. The
   participants watched a demonstration video before class, and then
   underwent self-directed practice as triads. Afterwards, each participant
   video-recorded their skill performance and completed post-class
   questionnaires. The videos were evaluated by two blinded assessors.
   Results A hundred and thirty-one participants (63.9\%) completed the
   questionnaire. For bag mask ventilation, participants who claimed to
   have watched the corresponding demonstration video before class achieved
   higher performance scores (those who watched before class: 7.8 +/- 1.0;
   those who did not: 6.3 +/- 1.7; p < 0.01). For intravenous cannulation,
   while there is no significant difference in performance scores (those
   who watched before class: 14.3 +/- 1.3; those who did not: 14.1 +/- 1.4;
   p = 0.295), those who watched the video before class received less
   interventions from their peers during triad practice (those who watched
   before class: 2.9 +/- 1.8; those who did not: 4.3 +/- 2.9; p < 0.05).
   The questionnaire results showed that most participants preferred the
   new approach of clinical skill teaching and perceived it to be useful
   for skill acquisition. Conclusion The flipped classroom, same-level
   peer-assisted learning model is potentially an effective way to address
   the current challenges and improve the efficiency of clinical procedural
   skill teaching in medical schools.},

Abstract = {Purpose
   Flipped classroom (FC) is a potential approach that encourages active
   learning and enhances student performance while reducing the failure
   rate in education. This study was carried out to present the conceptual
   model of FC adoption by students in higher education.
   Design/methodology/approach
   This was a cross-sectional study in which 110 medical students from
   Tabriz University of Medical Sciences, Tabriz, Iran, were selected by
   convenience sampling methods as the sample population. An extended
   technology acceptance model (TAM) was applied to determine the students'
   intention concerning the FC adoption. A research-based questionnaire,
   the validity and reliability of which have been approved, was used as
   the data collection instrument. The data was analyzed by SPSS v16, IBM.
   Correlation and regression methods have been used in the empirical
   study. Finally, the authorized model was presented.
   Findings
   The data show that subjective norms and perceived enjoyment have a
   direct and significant effect on perceived usefulness of the FC approach
   (ss = 0.32, P-value < 0.05), (ss = 0.7, P-value < 0.01). Also, we found
   that perceived usefulness (ss = 0.67, P-value < 0.01), perceived ease of
   use (ss = 0.51, P-value < 0.01) and self-efficacy (ss = 0.43, P-value <

   Originality/value
   The findings of this study should be considered when successful
   implementation of FC is in progress.},

Title = {Effect of flipped teaching on the performance and perceptions of
   pre-service teachers on a biology course},

Abstract = {Purpose
   The purpose of this paper is to analyse student performance and
   perceptions when a flipped classroom setting is used, in comparison with
   the traditional model.
   Design/methodology/approach
   The inverted learning model or ``flipped classroom{''} is a pedagogical
   approach that attempts to reverse the traditional teaching and learning
   process, making the student the protagonist of their own learning, and
   is characterised by the theoretical contents being taught ``outside the
   classroom{''}, allowing students to spend more class time carrying out
   other types of more practical activities that encourage much more active
   learning, such as enquiry exercises, problem solving, collaborative
   projects and so on. The study was conducted on a biology course of the
   Primary Education Bachelor's Degree during the 2017/2018 academic year
   (n = 240).
   Findings
   The results revealed that better learning outcomes were achieved by
   students when the flipped classroom methodology was proposed. It has
   also been found that student perceptions of the teaching approach were
   more positive when the flipped model was followed. The flipped classroom
   methodology also seems to foster student participation and motivation
   more effectively than traditional teaching formats, mainly because the
   active learning activities that are carried out in this new educative
   approach manage to involve the students in their own learning processes.
   Originality/value
   Despite the enhanced popularity of flipped classroom research in
   multiple educational contexts and the growing number of studies
   published in recent years, there is little empirical evidence regarding
   the effect of the flipped classroom on learning outcomes and
   satisfaction in pre-service teachers.},

Abstract = {Aim To investigate the use of game-based learning (GBL) to enhance
   students' experience of the flipped classroom (FC) in dental education.
   Materials and Methods Students participated in three sessions organised
   as FC, implemented either as conventional FC or FC augmented with
   theGoDental!game. In the pre-class phase, sessions 1 and 2 were
   organised as instructor-made video lectures, plus a questionnaire. These
   activities were supplemented with the individual development of
   questions and answers for the game in session 3. In the in-class phase,
   group and plenary discussions were used during sessions 1 and 2 and were
   replaced by game activities in session 3. Perceptions of session 3
   compared to that of sessions 1 and 2 were explored via a questionnaire
   with both open-ended and Likert-scale items. Results Most students (29,
   97\%) perceived the FC session augmented with theGoDental!game as
   enjoyable. The game augmented session was perceived as more enjoyable
   compared to the conventional FC sessions. Students agreed that GBL
   augmented FC compared to conventional FC increased engagement (25,
   83\%), motivation (24, 83\%), their integration in the social
   environment (23, 77\%) and concentration (22, 73\%), helped them learn
   more about the topic (24, 80\%) and was a good learning method (25,
   83\%). There was a positive correlation between the degree of enjoyment
   and concentration and the feeling that the game helped them learn more
   about the topic. Conclusion Game-based learning augmented FC proved to
   enhance students' experience, resulting in increased enjoyment compared
   to the conventional FC setup. Future studies should explore whether the
   use of GBL in FC has the potential to increase examination performance.},

Abstract = {Student engagement is an indicator that correlates with the overall
   quality of learning. Strategies such as the flipped-classroom approach
   aim to increase student engagement, but new learning designs require
   careful consideration in terms of how they are experienced by students
   and whether they mediate an enhanced learning experience. The study
   aimed to explore how student learning behaviour and well-being changed
   with a transition in learning design from the traditional lecture-based
   approach to a flipped-classroom approach. Students were recruited during
   three eight-week Child and Adolescent Health blocks of a four-year
   graduate-entry medical program. Students were invited to use the
   myStudyMate app as a daily activity tracker for one week, completing
   daily reports on perceived learning quality and physical and emotional
   well-being. There were 38 student participations in the study. Results
   show that most students had a healthy balanced day. Students spent more
   time studying online than reading prescribed textbooks, which was most
   pronounced during the lecture week using the flipped classroom approach.
   With the flipped classroom approach, students spent more time examining
   patients (0.51 h in traditional versus 1.18 h in flipped classroom p =
   0.02) and taking patient histories (0.31 h in traditional versus 0.71 h
   in flipped classroom p = 0.03). Qualitative results emphasized the value
   of knowledgeable and enthusiastic educators who involved students in
   patient care and provided constructive feedback. In general, the study
   also demonstrated feasible use of a mobile application as a learning
   activity tracker to understand students' learning behaviour. Integration
   of the myStudyMate app with the existing learning management systems has
   been identified as one potential avenue for future research.},

Journal = {EDUCATION SCIENCES},

Month = {AUG},
Abstract = {Educational governmental institutions have recommended implementing
   blended learning in higher education to respond to the ``new educational
   normality{''} caused by the COVID-19 pandemic, although this is not a
   new challenge. Over the last few decades, higher education institutions
   have tried to incorporate the use of technological devices to university
   teaching, by redesigning and optimizing the learning experiences through
   a mixed teaching model. In this context, the Flipped Classroom (FC)
   model is one of the pedagogical models that is revolutionizing the scope
   of education. However, there is still not enough evidence of its
   advantages and disadvantages in the university stage. Therefore, it is
   important to analyze the impact of the FC on the learning, satisfaction
   and interaction of the different agents of the university community. Due
   to the idiosyncrasy of the present study, an exclusively qualitative and
   longitudinal methodology was selected; thus, 266 interviews based on
   open questions were conducted throughout the last five years. The
   results show that students value the FC model positively and corroborate
   its great potential from academic, competence, personal and social
   perspectives. Nevertheless, a small group of students are still very
   critical about the model and would prefer to keep using a traditional
   methodology, mainly due to the lack of habit using active methodologies
   and establishing the learning commitment required by such methodologies.},

Abstract = {Background: Constructivist student-centered instructional models such as
   the flipped classroom (FC) have been shown to improve learning.
   Methods: A FC approach was implemented for the surgery clerkship. Data
   was collected in phase 1 to evaluate student learning and attitudes.
   Based on these results, questions for the phase 2 open-ended survey were
   developed to improve understanding of learner attitudes, and ascertain
   how well the FC aligns with constructivist principles.
   Results: There was no significant difference in shelf exam performance
   between the control and intervention groups. A majority of students
   agreed that they preferred the FC over lectures, and that their learning
   improved. Open-ended survey analysis demonstrated that the FC fostered
   self-directed, active learning, and that the in-class sessions
   facilitated application of concepts and deeper learning. Areas
   identified for improvement included better alignment with learning
   preferences through greater variety of pre-class learning options,
   improvement of podcast technical quality, and utilization of smaller
   in-class discussion groups.
   Conclusions: Students had a positive perception of the FC. The FC
   supports self-directed and more active and deeper in-class learning. (c)

Abstract = {Innovative teaching in a form of the flipped classroom was adopted in an
   English course as a pilot project in a private university in Thailand.
   The purpose of this study was to assess how a modified ``flipped
   classroom{''} had an impact on students' learning performance and
   perceptions. The target group involved in a non-randomized experiment
   was 40 students from one section enrolled in an advanced English course
   in the summer session of the academic year 2016. They were required to
   watch the prerecorded lectures before class and then attend class to
   discuss on the topics, share knowledge, and perform tasks. The
   instruments consisted of 1) 5 assignments which were administered to the
   students, 2) a questionnaire investigating the students' perceptions on
   the flipped classroom and 3) a questionnaire used to find out their
   perceptions on autonomy. Data were analyzed by using percentage, mean,
   and standard deviation. The findings revealed that after the students
   were taught in the flipped classroom, their English scores were
   satisfactory. The results showed that most students were satisfied with
   lecture videos and Edmodo, the learning platform. They demonstrated good
   perceptions on flipping the classroom. What they claimed to gain the
   most from this class was becoming an autonomous learner. In addition,
   students' autonomy perceptions were higher than those before they were
   taught through the flipped classroom approach.},

   several systematic reviews that point to improved student results, it
   remains unclear if flipped classrooms have positive learning effects in
   physiology education. Flipped classroom teaching was introduced in two
   advanced physiology subjects (advanced neuroscience, semester 1, and
   cardiorespiratory and renal physiology, semester 2). Changing the mode
   of content delivery reduced the time students needed to spend listening
   to lectures by one-third, without sacrificing either learning content or
   academic standards. Higher pass rates were observed with larger number
   of students earning distinction and high-distinction grades.
   Statistically significant improvements in final grades were observed
   from both subjects (semester 1: 2017. 49.28 +/- 20.16; 2018, 53.29 +/-
   19.77, t(268) = 2.058, P = 0.0405; semester 2: 2017, 58.87 +/- 21.19;
   2018, 67.91 +/- 20.40, t(111) = 2.306, P = 0.023). Finally, students'
   perception of their learning experience remained at or above the
   university benchmarks (median score of >80\% for all iterations of the
   subjects). While the most frequent and persistent area that students
   suggested could be improved was reduction of content, equal numbers of
   students commented that no improvement in the subjects was required.
   Despite the generally positive attitude to recorded didactic teaching
   content, classroom attendance remained very low, and students did not
   engage with the active learning content. This suggest that more emphasis
   needs to be placed on promoting class attendance by developing better
   active learning content.},

Abstract = {Online curriculums increase self-regulatory learning behaviors among
   students and facilitate knowledge transfer essential for deep learning
   to take place. Additionally, threshold concepts are best taught using a
   format that is designed for repeated point-of-need access by students.
   Pairing flipped classroom pedagogy, in which students engage with
   content independently prior to a synchronous class, with online learning
   objects intentionally designed to promote self-regulatory learning
   behaviors helps to build a strong foundation of information literacy.
   This paper discusses the decision of one library to move its information
   literacy curriculum to a fully online format in order to more
   effectively teach information literacy threshold concepts to students at
   all levels of college. The online curriculum was designed using both
   synchronous and asynchronous models of instruction and built upon the
   library?s online learning pilot project with first year Communication
   Studies students. A highlevel analysis of effective online pedagogy is
   offered in conjunction with a detailed look at the online course and
   content development process, librarians? training requirements, and the
   communication strategies used to inform campus stakeholders of the
   curricular change.},

   were asked to take the Instructional Materials Motivation Survey (IMMS).
   Results indicate that participants in the study were generally more
   motivated by AR educational material than by FC material; although mean
   motivation levels with both instruments are extremely high, with scores
   of 4.57 and 5.64 for FC and AR, respectively. Conclusions: Therefore, a
   conclusion was met which determines that these results are a starting
   point to continue the research of the motivational impact of using
   different types of videos in active methodologies.},

Title = {The effect of the online flipped classroom on self-directed learning

Abstract = {Background The COVID-19 pandemic has initiated digital developments in
   higher education while closing in-person university classes. As this
   crisis continues, the need to revive virtual learning opportunities was
   seriously felt. The present study was conducted to determine the online
   flipped classroom's effect on nursing students' self-directed learning
   readiness and metacognitive awareness. Methods This quasi-experimental
   single-group study with pretest-posttest design recruited 34 sophomore
   students of a nursing school in Lorestan province, Western Iran selected
   by census according to the inclusion criteria. Online asynchronous
   learning and online flipped classrooms were used during the semester's
   first and second eight weeks, respectively. Students filled out
   self-directed learning readiness scale and metacognitive awareness
   inventory online before, in the middle of, and at the end of the
   semester. Data were analyzed using paired t-test in Stata-14 software.
   Results There was no significant difference between the mean score of
   metacognitive awareness before and after Online asynchronous learning
   (P=0.15), but the mean score of self-directed learning readiness
   increased significantly after OA (P=0.0004). After applying online
   flipped classrooms, students' mean (SD) scores of metacognitive
   awareness and self-directed learning readiness were 272.03 (53.03) and
   162.03 (21.77), respectively, which confirmed their significant
   improvement compared to before the intervention. A comparison of the
   mean score changes of both methods indicated that their implementation
   did not lead to significant differences between the mean total score of
   metacognitive awareness (P=0.15) and the mean total score of
   self-directed learning readiness (P=0.07). Discussion Online flipped
   classroom approach can be used as an effective method in nursing
   education by improving self-directed learning and metacognitive
   awareness, which are essential in online education for nursing students.},

Abstract = {Recent years have brought the need for new pedagogical approaches that
   appeal to the involvement and participation of learners in the learning
   process. One of these approaches is the flipped classroom, which gives
   to learners the possibility to prepare for the next class, through
   pre-recorded video lectures and close-ended problems. Many studies
   merely replace in-class instructions by videos and use class time for
   group discussions. Nevertheless, what instructional design framework
   should we use in planning the overall flipped classroom approach? This
   article answers this question through exploratory studies conducted at
   Algeria University. In this work, the authors have used a flipped
   classroom concept for an algorithmic course like java programming, based
   on learner's learning style and learner's skill level.},

Title = {The effectiveness of combining e-learning, peer teaching, and flipped
   classroom for delivering a physiology laboratory course to nursing
   students},

Abstract = {The Internet and 5G era makes e-learning a vital part of modern
   education, and extensive evidence has shown that peer teaching and
   flipped classroom contribute to increased success in medical teaching.
   However, the applicability of these pedagogies in laboratory courses
   remains largely unexplored. This study aimed to evaluate the academic
   performance, proficiency in procedural skills, and perception of nursing
   students in physiology laboratory classes delivered with nontraditional
   classroom (NTC) pedagogies comprising the combination of e-learning,
   peer teaching, and flipped classroom. Each class was subdivided into two
   equal halves by successive student identification (ID) number and
   randomly assigned to the control or NTC group. Compared to the control
   class, NTC teaching significantly enhanced mean score of six preclass
   tests (67.77 +/- 9.83 vs. 62.94 +/- 9.70), with ``B{''} graders
   increased obviously, suggesting that preclass e-learning was more
   effective than textbook-based preview, especially for general grasp of
   the topic. Similarly, average scores on postclass quizzes in the NTC
   group were improved (79.40 +/- 9.12 vs. 74.43 +/- 8.88). Lesser time
   cost and higher success rates were observed in trachea, artery, and
   heart catheterizations in the NTC group, although no disparities were
   found in ureteral intubation. The majority (similar to 74\%) of students
   supported the reform and shared positive experiences with NTC
   methodology. They reported that virtual experiments and self-paced
   procedural skill videos affected pre- and in-class learning outcomes
   most, respectively. These findings indicated that NTC pedagogy was
   workable to improve students' subject scores and proficiency in
   complicated and direct-viewing procedural skills and was favorable to
   students.},

Abstract = {In the past few years, the concept and approach of Flipped Classroom
   (FC) has been increasingly opted for the undergraduate medical students.
   The first route for exposure to content is through online resources for
   the students in FC application. Then, for promotion of active learning,
   subsequent face to face/offline classes are held for student-cantered
   activities. Even though this approach of FC has been handsomely adopted
   by students from different contexts, the insight of medical students is
   still unclear regarding this approach. This review paper provides
   perception of medical students towards FC, its benefits, and limitations
   for them. For pre-class preparation activities, medical students have
   shown positive expression along with occupying, interactive mini
   classroom projects, especially when they are also given concise and
   easily accessible online tools. However, concerns were reported by some
   students with the FC approach. They stated that inferior student
   preparation and inappropriate direction in online and active learning
   sessions can restrict the student-cantered perks. Despite the high ratio
   of students who states that FC is a healthy approach for enhancement of
   knowledge and learning, it has not been conclusively depicted by
   assessment tools. Nevertheless, the perceptions of students show that
   self-directed life-long expertise are improved by FC. In the nutshell,
   the initial application of the approach of FC for undergraduate medical
   students has depicted great satisfaction among students who prefer it
   for lecture-based instructions.},

Title = {A hybrid strategy to develop real-life competences combining flipped
   classroom, jigsaw method and project-based learning.},
Journal = {JOURNAL OF BIOLOGICAL EDUCATION},
Abstract = {The professional profiles of future scientists need to undergo a deep
   and rapid change to address recent advances in biomedical sciences and
   the social and environmental contexts in which we currently live. For
   instance, they have to be trained to be able to develop innovative and
   creative strategies for solving complex problems under a responsible
   research and innovation (RRI) perspective. Training these competencies
   should start during higher education. We propose a hybrid activity
   combining flipped classroom, project-based learning, and the jigsaw
   technique to employ transversal skills in a complex and real-world
   context. We found that this combination motivates students'
   self-learning processes overall, with the development of competencies
   such as creativity, teamwork, and oral communication. Further, it trains
   them for the real-world challenges they might face in their future
   professional careers. Notably, the combined activity increases both
   motivation and acquisition of knowledge needed to pass the subject more
   than the conventional learning. Introduction of the hybrid activity also
   allows the students to develop competencies that are not otherwise
   trained in classical approaches, including linking concepts from
   different subjects, creativity, and critical thinking.},

Abstract = {The present study investigates the effect of the Flipped Classroom (FC)
   model on the academic achievement and motivation levels of preservice
   teachers enrolled on the Teaching Principles and Methods (TPM) course,
   which is a higher education-level knowledge course in the teaching
   profession. A quasi-experimental design was adopted for the study, and
   the opinions of the participants of the course were taken at the end of
   the implementation process. The experimental group took the 14-week TPM
   course based on a FC model, while no intervention was made in the
   control group, which completed the process based on the current
   curriculum. In the experimental group, an interactive and controlled
   online learning environment was used to access the FC videos. Based on
   the findings of the study, it was found that the academic achievement
   and motivation levels of the preservice teachers in the experimental
   group were significantly higher than those in the control group. The
   preservice teachers expressed that the FC model provided them with the
   opportunity to put their knowledge into practice, while also improving
   their teaching skills and ensuring their active participation in the
   lesson. Their criticisms of the model, on the other hand, related mostly
   to the technical problems they encountered.},

Abstract = {Objective This study aimed to determine the value, strengths, and
   challenges of implementing an e-learning based flipped classroom (FC)
   educational modality as part of the standardized physiology National
   Neonatology Curriculum (NNC), created for neonatal-perinatal medicine
   (NPM) fellow learners and faculty educators.
   Study Design This is a cross-sectional study of NPM fellows and faculty
   educators who utilized at least one of the e-learning based NNC FC
   respiratory physiology programs between May and September 2018.
   Participants were surveyed anonymously regarding their experiences
   participating in the NNC, including measures of preparation time. A
   combination of descriptive statistics and proportion comparisons were
   used for data analysis.
   Results Among 172 respondents, the majority of fellow and faculty
   respondents reported positive attitudes toward the educational content
   and case discussions, and the majority supported national
   standardization of NPM physiology education (92\%). Fellows reported
   greater preclass preparation for their FC compared with previous
   didactic lectures (30-60 vs. 0-15minutes, p <0.01). Faculty facilitators
   reported less preparation time before facilitating a FC compared with
   the time required for creating a new didactic lecture (median: 60 vs.
   240minutes, p <0.01). Both fellows and faculty respondents preferred the
   FC approach to traditional didactics, with fellows showing a greater
   degree of preference than faculty (68 vs. 52\%, respectively, p =0.04).
   Conclusion Fellows and faculty educators supported the FC learning,
   reporting peer-to-peer learning, and the establishment of a learning
   community which promotes adult learning and critical thinking skills. A
   national physiology curriculum creates equitable and engaging
   educational experiences for all NPM fellows while reducing individual
   program burden of content creation. Our findings further supported the
   development of an NNC using a flipped classroom modality.},

Abstract = {The flipped classroom has gained prominence in higher education, but
   little has been written about its application in the Middle East. This
   study aimed to assess the feasibility, acceptability, and impact of
   flipping biochemistry classes in comparison to the traditional didactic
   program. The study was conducted on first-year medical students taking
   biochemistry at a private University in Saudi Arabia. A series of short,
   pre-recorded videos were used to replace traditional lectures. The
   scheduled lecture time was used for problem solving and discussion
   sessions. To gather their evaluation of the learning approach,
   participants completed an online survey. To study the effect of the
   learning approach on exam performance, the scores of the participants
   were compared in questions taught using the flipped classroom versus the
   traditional didactic method. Participants noted that the effort needed
   for the course was similar regardless of the learning approach.
   Moreover, examination performance measured using single best answer
   multiple-choice questions showed no difference between the two teaching
   methods. However, the participants did report a significantly better
   perception of the flipped classroom compared to the traditional
   approach. Although no significant improvement in examination results was
   noted, the participants significantly favored the flipped classroom over
   traditional lectures. This study has demonstrated that the flipped
   classroom can be used in the teaching of the biosciences within a Middle
   Eastern setting, resulting in an improvement in student satisfaction and
   engagement in the course materials.},

Title = {How the number of lessons flipped influence the overall learning
   effectiveness and the perceptions of flipped learning experiences?},
Journal = {INTERACTIVE LEARNING ENVIRONMENTS},
Abstract = {The flipped classroom approach is increasingly popular. The
   effectiveness of the flipped classroom is promising, yet there is little
   consensus on whether and how varying the number of flipped lessons
   influences the overall course effectiveness and the affective
   perceptions of flipped learning. This is important because of the
   potential impacts on students, teaching staff, and
   institutional-supporting staff when increasing the number of flipped
   lessons in a course. The present project collected 465 valid responses
   from university students who attended courses with varying numbers of
   flipped lessons in five different government-funded universities. Across
   different academic disciplines, results converged to identify that
   students learning in a course that flipped 40-50\% of lessons showed the
   highest learning outcomes in terms of interpersonal and communication
   skills, critical thinking and problem-solving skills, as well as feeling
   the most positive towards their flipped learning experiences. Our
   findings not only increase the understanding of the flipped classroom
   instructional strategy but also provide practical suggestions in course
   design and support, so as to maximize the benefits of the flipped
   classroom instructional strategy.},

Abstract = {The growth of active methodologies in the context of primary and higher
   education has, slowly, transformed educational reality. In those
   methodologies, the students' role becomes even more pronounced,
   inverting the logic of knowledge transfer of traditional teaching. It is
   within this context that the present work aims to understand the
   advancement on the research concerning the Flipped Classroom (FA) method
   in the teaching of Physics in Brazil. For such, it was conducted a
   search on the Capes' Theses and Dissertations Catalogue, obtaining
   twelve text that approached the strategy. The works were analyzed
   according to the Bardin Content analysis (2002) and with the support of
   the text analysis software Iramuteq 0.7 alfa 2. The resulsts show a
   cluster of research at Masters degree level, with enphasis on High
   School education, and concentrated in the South and Southeast regions.
   Concerning the content of of those dissertations, it is noticeable that
   there is strong indicative of pedagogical intervention research with
   enphasis on the questions in two investigation interess groups: the
   first one, that aims to understand the teaching process; and the second,
   that aims to understand the learning based on this strategy.},

Abstract = {INTRODUCTION: Teaching is one of the most important needs of human
   societies, and selecting the best method of teaching is so important to
   improve the teaching as well as learning of students. The purpose of
   this study was to determine the effect of case-based teaching (CBT) and
   flipped classroom methods in comparison with lecture method on students'
   learning and satisfaction at internship of Department of General
   Surgery, Isfahan University of Medical Sciences. MATERIALS AND METHODS:
   This experimental study was performed on fifty medical surgery
   internship students in Isfahan University of Medical Sciences in 2017.
   Students were randomly divided into two groups of control group and
   intervention group. The data were collected by a posttest after holding
   every class and a researcher-made form for evaluating students'
   satisfaction after the end of the project. The results of this study
   were analyzed by SPSS 21 software using descriptive statistical methods
   (mean and standard deviation) and paired t-test. RESULTS: The comparison
   of the mean posttest scores in the three classes showed that the mean
   scores of the students in the intervention group in the first and second
   sessions unlike the third session were higher than that in the control
   group; this difference was statistically significant in the first
   session (P = 005) and the third session (P = 0.002). Students'
   satisfaction with case-based learning method (4.03 +/- 0.87) was higher
   than that of lecture method (2.88 +/- 0.78). CONCLUSION: In CBT and
   flipped classroom, students' learning and the quality of teaching were
   improved. In addition, students were more satisfied with this method in
   comparison with the lecture method. However, it should be noted that the
   success of using this teaching method depends on choosing the
   appropriate subject.},

Abstract = {The present study shows the impact of using flipped classroom with
   just-in-time teaching, Unity3D and gamification in media:scape LearnLab
   classrooms to make the best decisions for the mitigation of climate
   change, the promotion of sustainable development and rational use of
   energy. Climate change is perceived as a reality that we are already
   living, and it is considered by scientists as the greatest challenge of
   our times in need of immediate solutions. In Tecnologico de Monterrey,
   the subject, ``Climate Change and Energy Use,{''} is taught with the
   objective that its students and graduates are capable of proposing
   solutions to these problems. Nevertheless, some students view the course
   as a formality and do not attach real importance to it. Therefore, the
   objective of this research is to verify that learning increased
   significantly due to the course contents including a challenge to be
   resolved. A mixed-research methodology was applied, which allowed the
   collection, analysis and linkage of qualitative and quantitative data in
   the same study. The measuring instruments used were quizzes, focus
   groups and rubrics. The results obtained demonstrated the potential of
   the tools applied as learning strategies. The average grades in the
   evaluations improved notably compared with those who took the course
   with the traditional methodology.},

Abstract = {Medical education is a domain with fast-changing knowledge and attention
   to knowledge application and higher order thinking; therefore, how to
   implement effective teaching is a crucial issue. Based on the
   technology-based learning model, this study provides a multidimensional
   analysis of published papers on the flipped classroom in medical
   education from the SCOPUS database, including the form of the learning
   materials, learning system or player, learning strategies, educational
   technology, application domains, research issues, participants, and
   research methods. Based on the results, the application of flipped
   classrooms in medical education has grown rapidly over the past decade,
   with the number growing dramatically from 7 papers in 2014, to 16 papers
   in 2015, and 22 papers in 2016. It was found that a great number of
   studies adopted instructional videos uploaded on online learning systems
   or used existing online videos to conduct before-class teaching in the
   before-class stage of the flipped classroom; moreover, most studies
   involved no online discussion in the before-class stage. As for learning
   strategies in the in-class stage, the most frequently adopted strategies
   were issue discussion, practicing or doing exercises, and problem-based
   learning. This implies that most studies mainly emphasized basic
   knowledge understanding and skills training, while little attention was
   paid to developing learners' higher order thinking skills. In addition,
   the majority of studies explored students' learning
   interest/satisfaction, learning experience, and performance on the
   cognitive aspect, while little research was found to investigate their
   preparation degree or cognitive loading. Based on the review results,
   this study provides the research trends and potential research issues of
   flipped medical education to serve as a reference for researchers,
   instructors, and decision makers.},

Month = {JUN},
Abstract = {In 2016 and 2017 the first three MOOCs (Massive Online Open Course)
   addressing One Health were released, two of them by University of Geneva
   and University of Basel (Switzerland). With the support of Swiss School
   of Public Health and using these two highly interdisciplinary MOOCs, the
   first `Global Flipped Classroom in One Health' was organized in Geneva
   and Basel in July 2017. This innovative event gathered 12 Swiss and
   international MOOC learners to work on specific public/global health
   challenges at the human-animal-ecosystem interface in interdisciplinary
   teams supported by experts from academia and international organisations
   (e.g. World Health Organization) based in Geneva, Basel and
   internationally. According to the final survey, the level of
   satisfaction by learners was high and they benefited from the experience
   in different ways: reinforcement of their knowledge and capacity to
   perform innovative research in One Health (e.g. using digital
   epidemiology), visits and meetings with experts in Global Health (e.g.
   World Health Organization and Institute of Global Health in Geneva,
   Swiss Tropical and Public Health Institute in Basel) and emerging
   research collaborations etc. A novel project-based learning and research
   model arising from MOOCs was successfully created, which offers
   opportunities for global education and research addressing real world
   challenges utilising a One Health approach.},

Abstract = {Today with the technology development, the learning activity takes some
   different methods and approaches. Among these approaches, we can talk
   about virtual learning using the learning management systems and the
   flipped classroom concept. Moodle platform represents one of these
   systems. The limitation of this Platform is the lack of an integrated
   adaptive mechanism to manage the students' learning process. In this
   paper, we present a model that can be combined with the Moodle platform
   to provide students with an adapted content according to their knowledge
   level and skills. Also, offer the instructors the ability to manage the
   learning mechanism of their students in the context of flipped learning.
   The model was validated by the implementation of the Smart Adaptive
   Management for Flipped Learning (SAM-FL) plugin. The proposed model is
   based on several hierarchical agents allowing modularity in the
   development of course content and tests' thresholds. The evaluation of
   the model was carried out objectively by comparing learner output levels
   against entry levels, and subjectively by performing a quality of
   experience with the learners. The obtained results showed the model
   effectiveness in terms of learners' improvement levels and acceptance of
   our solution towards them.},

Abstract = {The flipped classroom approach is an emerging instructional approach
   that integrates digital technology. This approach has been applied in
   several fields, and it has demonstrated considerably higher learning
   effectiveness than conventional teaching modes. Common problems in its
   implementation that directly or indirectly affect learning effectiveness
   include students' low intention to preview learning materials and low
   class participation. To overcome these problems, the present study
   sought to increase students' intention to preview learning materials and
   participate in class through the implementation of educational
   activities integrated with an incentivisation system using a virtual
   currency and the provision of handouts. Students in two programming
   classes in the information management department of the participating
   university were divided into the experimental and control groups. The
   intention to preview learning materials, levels of class participation,
   and learning effectiveness were all significantly higher in the
   experimental group than in the control group.},

Abstract = {The purpose of this study was to determine the effect of Flipped
   Classroom (FC) model on metacognitive writing awareness and writing
   achievement. The pre-/post-test control group research model was used in
   this study. The research was carried out in a middle-school which is in
   Black Sea region of Turkey and totally 55 (28 experimental, 27 control)
   students participated in the study. Also, this study carried out within
   the scope of the Turkish course. The experimental group was taught based
   on the FC model for eight-weeks, on the other hand the control group was
   taught the story writing in face-to-face model. The data were collected
   using the Narrative Text Analytic Rubric (NTAR) and the Metacognitive
   Writing Awareness Scale (MWAS) which was developed by the researcher and
   analyzed with the IBM SPSS Statistics 22.0 program. The results of the
   study showed that the metacognitive writing awareness and story writing
   achievement of the teaching group based on the FC model were
   statistically higher than the students in the traditional face-to-face
   teaching group.},

Title = {Assessing Female Pharmacy Students' Satisfaction with Active Learning
   Techniques at King Saud University},
Journal = {ADVANCES IN MEDICAL EDUCATION AND PRACTICE},
Year = {2021},
Volume = {12},
Pages = {319-327},
Abstract = {Background: Studies conducted in Saudi Arabia assess student's
   perception towards using the flipped classroom or audience response
   system (ARS) separately, none integrated the two strategies. This study
   aims to evaluate pharmacy students at King Saud University - college of
   pharmacy's perceptions of student engagement and satisfaction with
   audience response system (ARS), and the flipped classroom techniques.
   Methods: Two lecture topics were flipped and delivered to female
   students enrolled in the pharmacy practice lab course at the university.
   An audience response system was integrated into the flipped classroom.
   The satisfaction of the students was measured using an online
   questionnaire. They then rated their satisfaction on a 5-point Likert
   scale ranging from 1 (strongly disagree) to 5 (strongly agree).
   Results: Overall, 82.1\% of the students stated that the ARS made the
   class better; 71.64\% agreed that taking a course in a flipped classroom
   was a useful learning experience. Online questionnaire revealed that the
   ARS fostered students' thinking skills and peers' interaction. Many
   students report that the flipped classroom made them evaluate their
   learning processes and pace themselves according to their speed, time,
   and level of interest. Students, however, stated that technical issues
   and time-consuming tasks were a downside to these teaching strategies.
   Conclusion: Although the students' overall response to the use of ARS
   and flipped classroom techniques was positive; limited class time
   hindered students from achieving the full benefits reaped from these
   strategies. Therefore, as per our study's results, modifying the
   duration of the class to ensure it is not too short to be overwhelming
   can help instructors utilize these startegies in the best possible
   manner. Alternatively, a thorough and pre-emptive selection of familiar
   discussion topics ahead of time would also help in this regard.},

Abstract = {Flipped Classroom (FC) has been considerably investigated in research
   and practice contexts because of the capacity it assumes to have in
   enhancing learners' outcomes. However, research that explores advance
   organizers' impact, which might result in affecting the expected
   learning outcomes in the FC, is still insufficient. Hence, the present
   study aimed to assess the effectiveness of advance organizers
   utilization in FC via Learning Management System to develop learners'
   integrated science process skills. It was carried out on all home
   economics students enrolled in a course entitled ``Research Proposal{''}
   who were randomly divided into two equal groups, experimental and
   control. Data were collected through a five- domain product evaluation
   card namely, the operational definition; identifying and controlling
   variables; formulating hypothesis; experimenting; and interpreting data.
   Results showed that achievement and performance of participants who
   learnt the course content via FC lectures with the use of an advance
   organizer were better than the performance and achievement of their
   colleagues in the control group that were not provided by any advance
   organizer. In light of these results, the study concluded that advance
   organizers, if used in FC could have interesting benefits for research
   and development of learners' integrated science process skills.},

Abstract = {COVID-19 has generated a series of changes in the different spheres of
   our lives. These changes have been particularly visible in the education
   field, where it has been necessary to urgently rethink the training
   processes in terms of non-face-to-face. Based on this situation, this
   work presents a Flipped learning experience carried out with the first
   year's students of the Degree in Pedagogy of the University of Valencia.
   An analysis of student's prior conception of this methodology and its
   perception after completion of its implementation is also proposed,
   offering a transverse view. To this end, the information of the 107
   participants has been collected through a validated instrument to
   analyze the usefulness of resources and methodologies based on three
   dimensions: communicative, instrumental and pedagogical. The results
   suggest that the perception of usefulness on the part of students is
   higher in the post-test than in the pre-test in all three dimensions. It
   also points out that, while in the pretest the highest score was
   associated with the instrumental dimension, in the post-test the highest
   usefulness is linked to the pedagogical dimension, materializing the
   importance of the participant's experience and the impact of flipped
   classroom on their learning.},

Abstract = {Aim The aim of this study was to investigate the effectiveness of
   blended learning with a flipped classroom design on student academic
   achievement in a Bachelor of Science in Nursing course.
   Design A quasi-experimental study.
   Method Students were split into an experimental blended learning with a
   flipped classroom design group and a control group using the
   traditional, teacher-centred learning method. Data were collected during
   spring 2018 (13.3 weeks) and student's grades for the registered course
   and their grade point average (GPA) were recorded.
   Results Findings showed statistically significant increases in student
   grades in the experimental group. Predictability calculations also
   showed better achievement of learning outcomes if a blended learning
   with a flipped classroom design is continued to be used in the future.},

Abstract = {The flipped classroom, as an active learning model, has given remarkable
   results in several areas of university teaching; however, its execution
   can still be improved. This research shows the implementation and
   improvement of the flipped classroom model in the Pavements course. It
   evaluates their influence on the students' final grades and on their
   learning experience. Three groups of students participated in this
   study, who enrolled in the course of Pavements of the Civil Engineering
   program. Group A took the course with the traditional model, while Group
   B took it with a flipped classroom, and Group C experienced it with a
   reinforced flipped model. Groups took the course in 2017, 2018 and 2019,
   respectively. Results show that despite using the flipped classroom
   models, the finals grades did not increase compared to those of the
   traditional model; however, they improved their learning experience. The
   students were more satisfied with the method; they even asked for fewer
   modifications than they did in the traditional model. This research
   shows that adding little academic tasks to the course would greatly
   influence the students' opinion.},

Title = {The Flipped Classroom in Introductory Statistics: Early Evidence From a
   Systematic Review and Meta-Analysis},
Journal = {JOURNAL OF STATISTICS EDUCATION},
Year = {2020},
Volume = {28},

Pages = {316-325},

Abstract = {The flipped classroom (FC) inverts the traditional classroom by having
   students participate in passive aspects of learning at home and active
   aspects of learning in class with the guide of an instructor. The
   introductory statistics course for nonmath majors may be especially
   suited to the FC model given its unique challenges as a required course
   for students with varying mathematical skills and background. For
   example, these students often have low interest and high
   statistics-related anxiety. Recent studies suggest the FC for
   introductory statistics courses leads to increased performance relative
   to a traditional lecture-based classroom (LC). This meta-analysis
   compared the academic performance of students in introductory statistics
   courses for nonmath majors who were taught in a FC versus those taught
   in a LC. Results indicate that students in the FC had statistically
   discernibly higher final performance outcomes compared to the LC
   delivery with an average difference of 6.9\% in performance (Hedge's g =
   0.43), though there was evidence of moderation by the presence of weekly
   in-class quizzes. These findings suggest that implementing the FC within
   the introductory statistics classroom at the undergraduate level may
   improve learning achievement, but more research is needed to explore the
   role of regular class quizzes. for this article are available online.},

Title = {A scoping review on flipped classroom approach in language education:
   challenges, implications and an interaction model},
Journal = {COMPUTER ASSISTED LANGUAGE LEARNING},
Abstract = {The present work synthesizes the studies in flipped language education
   based on Social Sciences Citation Index publications up to the year
   2018. A sum of 33 studies were finalized as the targeted studies and our
   research questions were formulated regarding (1) the overall trend and
   features of the existing studies, (2) their research foci, (3) the role
   of technology, and (4) the integration of FL/L2 learning and teaching
   theories, models or strategies into flipped classroom. Some research
   gaps were identified, including a bias toward outcome-oriented
   quantitative studies over process-oriented qualitative studies.
   Additionally, an overwhelming majority of the studies were conducted
   from the learners' perspectives, while few studies took the teachers'
   perspectives. More importantly, to guide the course design and
   implementation, the present review proposed a comprehensive `interaction
   model' integrating four key elements into flipped FL/L2 education. The
   model featured two types of interaction, namely `interaction with
   content' and `interaction via content', highlighting the uniqueness of
   flipped FL/L2 education. The study incorporated learner preparedness in
   the interaction model, entailing a practical interface for the principle
   of `design for failure', that is, predicting and preparing contingencies
   for the times when in-class interactions do not go as planned for
   technical or other reasons.},

Abstract = {This research studies the efficiency of Flipped Classroom (FC) and
   Challenge-Based Learning (CBL) as an innovative methodology to
   facilitate the learning of concepts involving sustainability and the
   circular economy by higher education students. This study, conducted as
   part of various innovative education projects, was applied in different
   courses (Environmental Management, Environmental Engineering and
   Industrial Ecology) taught to different engineering majors (Degree in
   Geomatics and Survey Engineering and Master's Degree in Chemical
   Engineering) at the Universidad Politecnica de Madrid (Spain). The main
   aim is to enhance the environmental competences of students by means of
   unconventional learning, increasing the motivation, participation and
   grades of the students in the course. Our results indicate that, in
   general terms, the students rated the efficiency of the new learning
   methodologies as satisfactory; however, a more detailed analysis of the
   results reveals some aspects that need special consideration, such as an
   assessment of specific and cross-cutting competences, in addition to the
   lack of previous soft skills, such as teamwork, creativity and work
   planning.},

Title = {Mastery of Fundamental Concepts Based on Students' Learning Approach in
   Flipped Classrooms},
Journal = {JOURNAL OF CIVIL ENGINEERING EDUCATION},
Year = {2020},
Volume = {146},
Number = {2},
Month = {APR},
Abstract = {This case study aims to investigate the extent to which the teaching
   mode called flipped classroom is effective in enabling students to learn
   fundamental concepts in cost engineering. It adopted a repeated measure
   design and statistical evaluation to examine the learning approaches
   that enabled students to master fundamental concepts. It also identified
   the teaching modes that are effective in helping students to understand
   and apply fundamental concepts in solving cost engineering problems. The
   flipped classroom involved students learning one fundamental concept
   (TC1) via preclass online video clips in their own time, followed by
   in-class discussion, and applying the fundamental concept in solving
   problems in a face-to-face (F2F) tutorial setting. Thereafter, they were
   tested for their mastery of TC1. As a comparison, the same students were
   taught another fundamental concept (TC2) via the traditional F2F lecture
   and tutorial settings. The study was repeated in the following academic
   year, with the teaching methods for TC1 and TC2 switched. The data
   collected included presurveys and postsurveys of perceived learning
   approaches, pretests and post-tests, and final examination results. This
   case study found that students achieve mastery (measured by final
   examination marks) of fundamental concepts regardless of whether the
   teaching mode is traditional lectures or flipped classroom. When
   students adopted a more surface-motive learning approach, they also
   performed significantly more poorly, regardless of teaching mode.
   Students who adopted a more deep-strategy learning approach when taught
   in flipped classroom mode performed better in final assessment. The
   finding is important because it reveals that the flipped classroom is
   just as effective as the traditional classroom in helping students to
   master certain cost engineering fundamental concepts. It is recommended
   that instructors consider using the flipped classroom to harness
   technology in education. Students are advised not to adopt surface
   learning approaches because these are detrimental to their mastery of
   cost engineering concepts.},

Abstract = {Technological advances have impacted almost every facet of modern
   culture and even in the educational methodologies. As new technologies
   become available, they are often embraced in educational innovation in
   an attempt to enhance traditional instruction. To this purpose, the
   ``flipped classroom{''} is a learning model in which content attainment
   is shifted forward to outside of class, then followed by
   teacher-facilitated concept application activities in class. The
   constructivist approach, realized through an active-learning style of
   teaching, is more important respect to the order with which the teacher
   participated in the learning process. In this respect, the goal is to
   provide an alternative teaching approach on environmental issue. In
   particular, thanks to active learning (flipped classroom) it is possible
   to know and to appreciate a new eco-friendly material named to
   ``Geopolymers{''}. One of the most important environmental advantage
   that can be attributed to this material is represented by the lower
   energy requirements for its production. Thus, this material could
   represent a potential tool able to mitigate the environmental pollution.
   In this regard, the geopolymers could provide a possible solution to
   wastes reuse as a resource to scale down the demand for extraction of
   new resources. This paper looks at some positive aspects of technology
   and waste treatment, and deals with the production of innovative
   building materials obtained by waste recycling known as geopolymers.
   Specifically, it is important to highlight the possibility of using
   wastes characterized by high silica and aluminum amounts as raw
   materials, particularly suitable to produce geopolymers by chemical
   activation with alkali. This is a useful method to improve
   hazardous-waste management and to reduce health and environmental issues
   due to the strong capability of make inert hazardous waste. This
   solution confirms the importance of re-manufacturing, reusing and
   recycling and, moreover, making a waste a new raw material and helps to
   move toward a more circular economy where wastes become negligible and
   further natural resources are used in an efficient and sustainable way.
   The proposed topic is addressed to students and aims to arouse their
   interest in the fields of the environmental protection and waste
   management, but overall it gives the perspective of natural resource
   preservation, and a most efficient way of their use without depleting
   the planet's resources.},

Abstract = {This study examined the development of students' language skills in a
   flipped English foreign language course designed with self-regulated
   learning strategies. The study was conducted with a quasi-experimental
   design. While the experimental group received the course through flipped
   classroom model designed with self-regulated learning strategies,
   control group did not use self-regulated learning strategies in the
   flipped classroom model. The results indicated that self-regulated
   learning strategies positively affected the development of foreign
   language skills in the flipped classroom model. A significant difference
   in favor of the group working with the platform including self-regulated
   learning strategies outperformed in speaking, reading, writing, and
   grammar test scores. However, no significant difference in the listening
   test results was found.},

Abstract = {Adopting new teaching practices, like the `flipped classroom', disrupts
   organizational routines within the university. This paper examines
   flipped classroom implementation from the perspective of four
   stakeholder groups students, instructors, administrators, and managers),
   using an organizational routines lens. Disrupting established routines
   created risk, decreases coordination and shared understanding, and
   increases time and cognitive load for stakeholders. We conclude that
   seemingly minor innovations in teaching delivery can have major and
   disruptive implications for the wider institution.},

Abstract = {The flipped classroom is an innovative and increasingly popular
   pedagogical approach in higher education. It emphasises student learning
   responsibility, deeper learning, differentiated instruction and more
   efficient use of class time. However, despite its increasing popularity
   across disciplines, few studies have elaborated on strategies for
   implementing a flipped classroom beyond its essential elements. The
   present study thus proposed a three stage collaborative instructional
   model (3-CI), an extension of the classic flipped classroom model. A
   case study approach was adopted to investigate 3-CI's effectiveness
   through students' perceptions in Research Methods in Educational
   Technology, with 29 graduate students. Results show that 3-CI increases
   participants' satisfaction, engagement and collaboration. Furthermore,
   3-CI design strategies, which emphasise collaboration and
   student-centredness, can help college educators to incorporate the
   flipped approach into their teaching practice.},

Abstract = {The educational potentials and challenges of ``flipping{''} a classroom
   are today well-documented. However, taking into account the
   contradictory results, literature on the benefits in using the flipped
   model as a socially inclusive technology-supported instructional design
   model is still in its infancy. This study seeks to investigate the
   perceptions of twenty-six (n = 26) trainee instructional media designers
   based on the access and use of a flipped instructional model, following
   an exploratory mixed method research with quantitative and qualitative
   data that was framed by learning concepts. Findings indicate that the
   flipped model supported really well exercises facilitating trainees'
   participation, particularly those with specific reference to gender, age
   and web-based open educational resources (OER) level of frequency use.
   Regular recordings of difficulty with long-time content lectures were
   perceived as the most effective for flipped instructional model use
   showing that course design matters for knowledge gain. The study results
   also confirmed the view of flipped classroom as facilitating model for
   learning activities with trainees to be actively participated and not
   being passive receivers of the main instructor's information or
   observers of other colleagues' practices and experiments. In this
   context, which is defined by severe resource constraints and fear of
   using web-based transactions or sources among lecturers and trainees,
   the simplicity and accessibility of a flipped model promises a
   successful adoption for instructional media technology in Higher
   education.},

Title = {Some Web-Based Experiences from Flipped Classroom Techniques in AEC

Journal = {EDUCATION SCIENCES},

Month = {MAY},
Abstract = {The classroom closure during the first semester of 2020 entailed
   decisive changes in higher education. Universities have become more
   digital in both the availability of e-resources and pervasive devices
   and how students communicate with lecturers and classmates. Learners
   adapted their study habits with a growing role of self-paced,
   internet-based strategies. Some flipped learning approaches have proven
   their efficacy under the remote-teaching physical constraints. This
   study aimed to appraise the outcomes from the implementation of various
   web-based, learning-aid tools on flipped teaching approaches in
   engineering modules. The open educational resources (OER) performed
   satisfactorily during the lockdown period in three universities from two
   countries with similar higher education models. Such resources
   encompassed classroom response systems and web-based exercise
   repositories, designed for diverse purposes such as autonomous learning,
   self-correction, flipped classroom, peer assessment, and guided study.
   The acquired experiences reveal that OER helped students to enhance
   their engagement, reach the deeper levels of the cone of learning, and
   widen their range of learning abilities. This procedure is easily
   attainable for architecture, engineering, and construction (AEC) courses
   and lifelong learning settings. Feedback from students, instructors'
   perceptions, and learning outcomes show the suitability and
   effectiveness of the web-based learning assistant procedure presented
   here.},

Abstract = {Although the flipped pedagogical approach has been exhaustively
   explored, the effect of video length remains sparsely studied. Through a
   mixed design, videos, and three ratio scales, this study determined the
   effect of video length on English proficiency, student engagement, and
   satisfaction in a flipped English classroom in China. We concluded that:
   (1) The short video (shorter than 5 minutes)-assisted English flipped
   classroom could lead to significantly higher English proficiency,
   student engagement, and satisfaction than the flipped classroom assisted
   with medium videos (10-20 minutes); and (2) The medium video-assisted
   English flipped classroom could lead to significantly higher English
   proficiency, student engagement, and satisfaction than the flipped
   classroom assisted with long videos (longer than 30 minutes). Designers
   of videos could make every effort to provide short videos to improve
   English proficiency, engagement, and satisfaction. They could also
   seriously consider a scale, a mobile platform, quizzes, pictures, and
   multimedia in the future design and innovation of videos.},

Abstract = {In recent years, due to the superiority of its teaching effect, the
   flipped classroom has attracted more and more attention from colleges
   and universities. In the information age, MOOC and micro-lectures have
   gradually entered the college classroom and become new ways of learning
   and teaching. Considering the further requirement on the quality of
   teaching, it is not enough to monitor merely the learning results.
   Instead, the curriculum reform requires more attention to the learning
   process. Data mining was combined with MOOC and micro-lectures in this
   study for the case study of the course of ``Virtual Reality
   Technology{''}. Academic performance, learning input and learning
   behavior were selected as the indicators to monitor the process of
   learning ``Virtual Reality Technology'. Relevant data were collected and
   analyzed. The analysis results were used as the basis to provide ideas
   and approaches for the implementation of reliable and effective teaching
   intervention methods in the process of teaching ``Virtual Reality
   Technology{''}, so as improve the quality of teaching and provide
   reference for other related courses.},

Journal = {JOURNAL OF EDUCATION AND FUTURE-EGITIM VE GELECEK DERGISI},
Year = {2019},

Pages = {1-16},
Abstract = {An action research study was carried out in the preparatory programme of
   a foundation university to examine student performance in terms of
   grammar taught in the writing lessons, and as an alternative method, the
   flipped classroom model was applied to a group of participants who
   learned theoretical knowledge through videos on the learning management
   system. The study lasted seven weeks and during the process, students'
   performance was noted with the help of a checklist. The experimental
   design with the pre-test - post-test control group and the
   semi-structured interview technique was applied. The students (n = 30)
   were asked to write an essay during the pre-test and post-test. These
   essays were assessed by three different teachers (the G-coefficient was
   found as .841) who used a pre-prepared rubric by the researchers.
   Findings indicate that the achievement of the experimental group, where
   the flipped classroom method was applied, was significantly higher than
   the control group. Students expressed positive views about the flipped
   classroom model during the interviews. Education performed using the
   flipped classroom model was considered time-saving, provided an
   opportunity for practice, was easily accessible; and distance education
   through videos was well-received by students.},

Journal = {AMERICAN JOURNAL OF SURGERY},

Abstract = {Background: We piloted a curriculum combining a flipped classroom with
   two-stage narration, role-play, and partial task trainer simulation to
   teach this critical skill to trainees.
   Methods: This ``flipped classroom{''} module (2012-2018) for open and
   percutaneous cricothyroidotomy (OC and PC) required participants to
   watch two 4 min training videos for OC and PC. The simulation session
   consisted of a 45-min hands-on simulation of OC and PC in which
   participants rotated between the roles of operator, narrator, and
   critiquer. Median performance scores were calculated.
   Results: 103 trainees were evaluated. The median performance score was
   14 out of maximum 14 (range: 9-14) across all trainees for OC. The
   median performance score was 13 out of maximum 13 (range: 3-13) across
   all trainees for PC.
   Conclusion: A multi-modality approach including the flipped classroom,
   role-play, and partial task trainer simulation is an efficient and
   effective method for teaching trainees proficiency in short, single
   operator procedures. (C) 2019 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.},

Title = {Investigating the impact of Flipped Classroom on students' learning
   experiences: A Self-Determination Theory approach},

Abstract = {Blended learning environments supported by the Flipped Classroom Model
   (FCM) have been repeatedly investigated in both research and practice
   contexts, primarily in terms of their capacity to foster students'
   cognitive learning outcomes and overall motivation for the learning
   process. However, despite the significant body of existing works
   studying these aspects, there are still very scarce insights regarding
   the potential reasons for this impact of FCM on students, from the
   perspective of how this model affects students' internal satisfaction
   dispositions and fulfills their various `needs' for sustaining their
   motivation. Therefore, by adopting Self-Determination Theory as a
   theoretical framework to model these student `needs', this work aims to
   address this identified issue and investigate, in an exploratory manner,
   the impact of FCM-enhanced blended learning environments not only on
   students' cognitive learning outcomes, but more importantly on their
   internal dispositions (level of satisfaction) and `needs' for
   competence, autonomy and relatedness. The work builds on educational
   data and evidence from three different implementations of FCM in action
   research studies across diverse K-12 subject domains, and reports on a
   consistent pattern of positive findings regarding the capacity of
   FCM-enhanced blended learning environments to improve the aforementioned
   aspects of students' learning outcomes and experiences, with a
   particular added value for low-performing students. Crown Copyright (C)

Abstract = {With the emergence of innovative mobile-based tools, new opportunities
   have been made to enhance the quality of language learning. Keeping this
   in mind, the current study aimed to investigate the impact of a flipped
   classroom on enhancing EFL learners' pragmatic competence. To this end,
   60 EFL learners from two universities in Iran were assigned into flipped
   and conventional groups. In the flipped group, the course materials were
   posted through Telegram app before the class, and the class time was
   mostly devoted to communicative activities. To elicit the required data,
   multiple sources of data collection, including a Discourse Completion
   Test (DCT), a study log, the teacher's field notes, a Learning
   Experience Questionnaire (LEQ), a written self-report survey, and a
   Technology Acceptance Model (TAM) questionnaire, were used. Both
   parametric and non-parametric statistics were used to analyze the data.
   The findings revealed that the participants of the flipped group were
   more engaged with the course contents and significantly outperformed
   their counterparts in the conventional group in the post-test. The
   results of the questionnaires suggested that most participants of the
   flipped group enjoyed learning English in a flipped learning
   environment, and willingly accepted Telegram as a suitable platform in
   learning language. The authors present insights into the impact of
   flipped classrooms on appropriate use of English refusals, the
   participants' perception of the flipped learning experience, their level
   of participation inside and outside the class, their impression of the
   online platform, Telegram, and offer implications for practice.},

Abstract = {The flipped classroom is becoming a popular course structure in many
   academic disciplines, but particularly in STEM disciplines, including
   mathematics. Considerable research has addressed potential advantages
   and challenges of teaching a flipped course, as well as examining
   students' attitudes towards the flipped classroom. Studies on students'
   academic performance in a flipped classroom remain relatively scarce,
   and have shown mixed results. This paper reports on a study using a
   flipped classroom design, combined with interleaved practice, in a
   5-credit precalculus course at a regional 4-year university. I evaluated
   the students' performance on the final exam compared to a similarly
   sized random sample of students from non-flipped sections of the same
   course. This evaluation was done by a single-blind student research
   assistant, to reduce researcher bias. I also tracked students success in
   the calculus sequence. Since grades in subsequent courses were
   determined by other instructors, they should also be free of researcher
   bias. I found the students in the flipped sections performed better on
   the final, with the difference being statistically significant. I found
   that the percentage of students completing subsequent calculus courses
   with a or better was not significantly different between the students
   coming from the flipped and the non-flipped sections of precalculus.},

Abstract = {The flipped-classroom method is acquiring importance as a pedagogical
   technique to improve the learning performance of students. So far, most
   studies have examined the possible applications of the flipped-classroom
   method in the natural sciences realm, with most analyses certifying its
   positive impact. Its has been applied much less frequently in the social
   sciences realm, particularly in political science. Our project aims to
   generate data about active learning in political science by conducting
   an experiment in a class entitled ``Regional Studies: Latin America.{''}
   Using quantitative analysis, we study academic performance in a flipped
   class, and through qualitative analysis, we explore student perceptions
   about the flipped classroom and other active-learning techniques.},

Abstract = {The paper proposes an interactive student response portfolio (ISREP)
   system with iBeacon and web-socket technology, which supports
   flipped-classroom learning activities in traditional classrooms. The
   design of the ISREP system aims at promote interactions in classroom
   learning (CL). It offers APPs and web-interface functions for students
   and teachers, respectively. Students' APP can scan iBeacon devices in
   classrooms and then automatically upload their identification
   information to the cloud space. Consequently, students' presence in
   classroom can be recorded automatically. Moreover, teachers employ
   another function the system provides to promote high interaction in
   classroom via displaying questions on the front screen in classroom.
   Meanwhile, it simultaneously pushes (multicasts) these questions to
   students' smartphones via web-socket technology. Subsequently, students
   send their responses for questions to the cloud space by the APP. During
   answering questions, the system presents temporary histograms of
   students' responses and counting-down statuses of a timer on the screen
   in classroom. A timer can be synchronized with students' APP by the
   web-socket technology. This way can promote students' interaction and
   interest and then students enjoy in quiz-like activities. Teachers can
   quickly get results of students' responses. A quasi-experiment was
   conducted in flipped-CL activities of a university class utilizing the
   system. Observing experimental results, it was found that students, who
   receive the instruction with the system, improved their interaction,
   learning interest, learning attitude, and learning satisfaction.
   Moreover, the proposed system helps teachers quickly obtain students'
   learning situation in classroom and then may adjust their instructional
   approaches or contents.},

Abstract = {The purpose of the present study was to examine the effect of
   implementing the flipped classroom (FC) model on students' learning
   outcomes in a business etiquette course. Quasi-experimental research was
   employed and supplemented by a questionnaire and semi-structured
   interviews. The study participants were 77 students in two classes of a
   business etiquette course. The experimental group consisted of 57
   participants in which the FC with the BOPPPS (bridge-in, objective,
   pre-assessment, participatory learning, post-assessment, and summary)
   model was implemented. The comparison group consisted of 20 participants
   for whom a traditional teaching method was applied. The results revealed
   that the students in the experimental group outperformed their
   counterparts in terms of learning outcomes. The perceptions of the
   experimental group were more favorable than those of the comparison
   group in terms of the instructor's teaching and skill learning. Through
   interviews, it was found that the experimental group students enjoyed
   the FC teaching method because this approach resulted in more
   teacher-student interactions and the class was lively, interesting, and
   explored practical applications for daily life, which markedly enhanced
   their learning outcomes. The use of FC with the BOPPPS model in business
   education is feasible and provides another approach to skill learning.},

   Anatomy Classroom: Shifting from Passive Traditional to Active Blended

Abstract = {One of the major challenges facing anatomy educators is delivering the
   anatomy materials in fewer hours with a reduction of anatomy courses in
   the integrated curricula. The flipped classroom modality may be an
   innovative solution. However, its effectiveness remains under debate due
   to a lack of outcome-based research and the mixed results of students'
   performance. The present study aimed to determine the outcome of the
   flipped classroom based upon the level of student cognition. The study
   investigated performance on 17 multiple-choice anatomy questions as a
   part of the final examination of the musculoskeletal system module. The
   results were compared between the first-year female students of Qassim
   Medical College, specifically the flipped classroom group (46 students)
   of the academic year (2018-2019) and the traditional group (49 students)
   of the academic year (2017-2018). The mean differences in the students'
   grades on the anatomy questions at the level of knowledge, application,
   and analysis using Cohen'sdtest were 0.43, 1.41, and 1.01, respectively.
   These results suggest the positive impact of flipping the students'
   classrooms on improving their levels of thinking according to Bloom's
   taxonomy. Perception surveys also revealed students' enthusiasm for the
   pre-class activities, leading to a better performance in the class with
   more engagement with their peers and teachers. The present study
   suggested that the flipped classroom modality can be performed to
   compensate for the reduction of anatomy educational hours. However,
   further studies are recommended to investigate the best practices of the
   flipped classroom that fit with the students' needs and workloads.},

Title = {Does Flipped Classroom Model Affect EFL Learners' Anxiety in English
   Speaking Performance?},

Abstract = {Learners of English as a foreign language (EFL) face various challenges
   which impede their efforts to achieve English proficiency, especially in
   speaking performance. In response, this study sets out to use the
   Flipped Classroom Model (FCM) as a teaching method to investigate the
   effectiveness of the FCM on EFL learners' anxiety in English speaking
   performance. A mixed-methods research design was utilized whereby 27
   Omani undergraduate students majoring in English as a foreign language
   at Buraimi University College (BUC), Sultanate of Oman were selected
   purposively as the subjects of the study. The collected data involved
   the Anxiety in English Speaking Performance Questionnaire (AESPQ) that
   was distributed in three stages: pre, midway and post the implementation
   of FCM. Another set of data was elicited in the focus group interviews
   and students' reflective journals. Findings indicated that after twelve
   weeks of using FCM, a considerable improvement occurred on EFL learners'
   anxiety in English speaking performance across time. The results of the
   One-way ANOVA showed that there were significant differences among the
   EFL learners' levels of anxiety in speaking English, F (2, 52) =
   111.492, P<0.001, eta(2) = 0.811), and MANOVA results revealed that
   there was a significant difference between the four dimensions of AESPQ
   over time (Wilks Lambda =0.017, F = 134.718, eta(2) = 0.983). FCM was
   found to be appropriate to all the students in this study since it
   satisfied their needs and suited their learning styles. Essentially, the
   findings reported in this research would contribute to advancing English
   language teaching, not only in instructional design but also in
   promoting EFL instructors to be more interested in using FCM.},

Title = {The Impact of Design Thinking on Problem Solving and Teamwork Mindset in
   A Flipped Classroom},
Journal = {EURASIAN JOURNAL OF EDUCATIONAL RESEARCH},
Year = {2021},
Number = {96},
Pages = {30-50},
Abstract = {Purpose: In this study, we presented the Design Thinking model called
   DITC (Design Thinking in Class) and conducted an experiment during one
   month with 197 engineering students at Hanoi University of Technology
   (HUST) to determine how this model could aid in the growth of problem
   solving and teamwork mindset in a flipped classroom. Method: A Design
   Thinking mindset questionnaire was given to 197 participants before and
   after this model was applied. A t-test was used to analyze the data.
   Findings: the DTIC model fostered students' mindsets such as empathy,
   holistic view, problem refraining, and teamwork. Students showed very
   positive feedback and reviews on the model. Implications to Research and
   Practice: DITC can assist students in grasping Design Thinking concepts,
   allowing them to understand real-world problems more effectively. This
   model can be used to support teamwork and problem-solving skills for
   online learning environments, especially during the Covid19 pandemic. We
   also included some suggestions for incorporating Design Thinking into
   the classroom so that this model can be applied more widely. (C) 2021

Abstract = {Higher education has aim to prepare students before they live in social
   life of community. The purpose of this study was determining difference
   student achievement and student character between group discussion
   flipped classroom (GDFC) and lecture learning. The population in this
   study consist of two classes with total sampling technique. 72 nursing
   students divided into two class. One class as control and the other one
   as treatment class. The design used form quasi experiment pre-test and
   post-test non-equivalent control group design. This study used two
   instrument an extended multiple choice and character questionnaire
   Hypothesis testing is done with Mancova after followed by the normality
   test, homogeneity test and linearity test. The results of the study
   stated as follows, first there were differences in student achievement
   and student character between GDFC learning and lecture with a
   significance value of p = 0.001. Second, there are differences in
   student achievement between GDFC learning and lecture with a
   significance value of p = 0.001. Third, there are differences in student
   character between GDFC learning and lecture with a significance value of
   p = 0.003. GDFC is superior in achieving learning achievement and
   efforts to improve character compared to lecture. GDFC can arouse the
   interest and desire of nursing students to learn through media that have
   been given before learning begins, build a culture of learning in the
   form of personal and interpersonal contact between students and
   students, between groups with groups and between students and lecturers.},

Abstract = {To determine the impact of cognitive style on change of concept of
   engagement in the flipped classroom, a sequential analysis from the
   perspective of Bloom's Taxonomy was conducted to establish if
   significant differences existed between the learning achievements and
   engagement of students with different cognitive styles. The participants
   were pre-service teachers who had registered for a school-based
   curriculum development methodology course in China, with a total of 53
   students from two classes, who performed a total of 1,599 behaviors in
   the discussion sections. The results show that the concepts of
   ``evaluate{''} (31.52\%) and ``analyze{''} (27.77\%) were the two most
   frequent behaviors in the Bloom's Taxonomy. The ``remember{''} and
   ``evaluate{''} were the significant starting behaviors for all of the
   students; ``remember{''} and ``evaluate{''} were the significant
   starting behaviors for the intuitive-style students, while
   ``understand{''} was a significant starting behavior for the
   analytical-style students. This confirms that the students with
   different cognitive styles implemented multiple strategies for learning.
   It is also found that the flipped learning promoted the students'
   achievement. The conclusions suggest that it is important to match the
   cognitive styles of students as well as the instructional methods in
   order to improve students' learning.},

Abstract = {The main objective of this study is to present a teaching-learning
   experience carried out before the appearance of the COVID-19 pandemic
   and to analyze its usefulness in times of social and academic
   restrictions, as well as its fit into an online teaching format. In
   recent years, much research has been done on the development and
   application of new teaching methodologies, but the current health
   emergency situation means that it is necessary to assess how these
   methodologies are useful in a context of social distancing. Managing
   teaching-learning processes following the closure of educational centers
   due to the pandemic caused by COVID-19 presents a significant challenge,
   not just in Business Management, but across all subjects. In the context
   of a pandemic, active methodologies take on greater importance as a way
   of adapting to new, socially distanced educational needs. This article
   presents a study carried out among students of Business Management at
   the University of the Basque Country (Spain). The study focuses on the
   context of the flipped classroom methodology, with students being asked
   to rate the effectiveness of this methodology, before and after the
   pandemic. Following the appearance of the pandemic, opinions have been
   strengthened in favor of the inverted classroom methodology, which is
   shown to be a powerful methodological alternative compatible with online
   teaching. Educational authorities must strengthen the technological
   tools as well as the teacher skills needed to develop capacities related
   to the rapid response to current and future teaching challenges.},

Abstract = {BackgroundFinnish permanent residents are covered by social security
   insurance administered by the Social Insurance Institution of Finland.
   The procedure of insurance is initiated with medical certificate written
   by the treating doctor. Thus, the doctor must have certificate writing
   skills accompanied with the knowledge of the content and goals for
   insurance. Quality certificates are important part of doctors'
   professional skills worldwide and most effective teaching methods for
   learning these should be investigated.MethodsMedical certificate data
   were collected from two independent courses of fourth-year student
   taught in autumn 2015 (N=141) and 2016 (N=142) in the medical faculty of
   the University of Eastern Finland. A random sample of 40 students per
   course was drawn for the analysis. All certificates were analyzed as one
   sample. This was done to obtain reliable results with internal control
   group on the differences between two teaching methods, the traditional
   approach and the flipped classroom (FC) approach, in 2015 and 2016,
   respectively. The medical certificates were evaluated and scored with a
   rubric (range: -4.00-14.25) by two independent experienced
   specialists.ResultsCompared to students in the traditional classroom,
   students involved in the FC received significantly higher scores in all
   relevant sections of the assessed certificates. The mean of the total
   scores was 8.87 (SD=1.70) for the traditional group and 10.97 (SD=1.25)
   for the FC group. Based on the common language effect size, a randomly
   selected student from the FC group had an 85\% probability of receiving
   a higher total score than a student from the traditional
   group.ConclusionIn this study, the FC approach resulted in a statistical
   significant improvement in the content and technical quality of the
   certificates. The results suggest that the FC approach can be applied in
   the teaching of medical certificate writing.},

Abstract = {This study investigates self-reported attitudes about
   technology-enhanced language learning in the flipped classroom across
   borders in three tertiary-level contexts. As a method to address
   students' needs for twenty-first century education, the flipped
   classroom pedagogical approach was chosen to explore student attitudes
   towards technology for language learning in credit-bearing language
   courses in USA and Macau and non-credit-bearing courses in Colombia.
   This study implemented an experimental design with a mixed methods
   approach for data collection. Data was collected from a technology
   survey, focus group sessions, and reflective essays. Before each class,
   students in the experimental groups in all three countries previewed
   lessons and engaged in activities through online videos and screencasts
   in order to better prepare for in class activities. Results showed that
   the USA experimental group showed a statistically significant difference
   in all self-reported attitudes in using technology for language learning
   overtime. Between groups statistical analyses found flipped classrooms
   experienced a statistically significant different change in
   self-reported attitudes on instrumentality, digital literacy, and
   anxiety. Overall, students in the USA and Columbian contexts may have
   less anxiety about using technology for language learning in a flipped
   classroom, and the flipped classroom may positively impact students'
   attitudes towards technology in Columbia, Macau, and USA.},

Abstract = {The results obtained thanks to the flipped classroom with `just Iiin
   time' teaching method are reviewed. This method allowed to know what the
   students did not understand after trying to study the instructive
   materials assigned to them. To achieve that the students work before
   class methods of marketing and gamification were developed. Methods for
   the analysis of student responses were also developed. The JiTT method
   allowes the teacher know in advance those aspects that are most
   interesting or most dificult to understand for the students as well as
   their most urgent doubts. Finally, we have developed methods to use the
   urgent doubts of the students to generate formative feedback and
   activities to do in the classroom. In the method named ``flipped
   learning forte{''} the teacher answer the urgent doubts of his students.
   In the method named `flip in colours' the teacher classify the doubts by
   their posible utility in the classroom using a color code. With the
   combined application of these methods in university courses the failure
   rate of the students has decreased and the mean grade in the exams for
   the assessment of learning has increased in more than one standard
   deviation. The rate of students that attain the level of mastery has
   increased, as well as the student evaluations about the teachers of
   these courses. Finally, the reasons underlying the efficacy of the
   proposed flipped method are discussed.},

Title = {A STEM Course Analysis During COVID-19: A Comparison Study in
   Performance and Affective Domain of PSTs Between F2F and F2S Flipped

Abstract = {Due to the worldwide COVID-19 pandemic, university education has faced a
   significant challenge that requires adaptation to virtual and online
   education. Here, a fruitful flipped methodology with increased
   popularity can support adaption to and improvement of the current
   pandemic situation. This research presents a comparison of two different
   instruction situations with an identical teaching methodology,
   face-to-face (F2F) and face-to-screen (F2S) flipped methodology, in
   terms of students' performance and affective domain in a science,
   technology, engineering and mathematics (STEM) course. It was considered
   and designed as an examination of 132 pre-service teachers (PSTs), with
   68 and 64 PSTs respectively for each group. The first group before the
   pandemic was applied by F2F flipped classroom and the second group after
   the pandemic was applied by F2S flipped classroom. The results after
   pertaining various data analyses of class activities and questionaries
   showed that performance had been improved for both groups toward the
   course. In addition, F2F had a significant difference in PSTs' emotion
   and perception toward the course and made classes more interactive. The
   mean score values of students' emotion and perception between two groups
   showed that the difference between these mean values were significant,
   suggesting a very large effect. Particularly, the effect size (ES)
   showed that positive emotions were more significant with different
   variables and the items Q7-Q9 of questionnaires indicated more
   significant different perceptions for both F2F and F2S after completing
   the course. Finally, the principal component analysis (PCA) test
   described that F2F answers were located mainly in the positive emotion,
   while F2S answers were grouped in the negative emotion, while no
   differences were observed for PSTs perceptions to the flipped
   methodology. Consequently, although F2F-F2S transition was an effective
   process, instructors and PSTs faced difficulties in the platform usage
   for online lectures reflecting emotions' results in F2S group. Thus, by
   solving the problems raised, it will allow PSTs to be more interactive
   in a virtual and online context for their future implementation by
   giving them active instruction methodology and educating future students
   to teach STEM contents.},

Abstract = {Universities all over the world are in search of innovative methods to
   ensure purposeful learning such as. Declarative accelerated blended
   learning (DABL) and flipped classrooms. No such interactive technology
   has so far been used in the higher education institutions of Pakistan. A
   pilot was carried out in the social sciences faculty of a private
   university to measure the effect of DABL on student learning in the
   Basic English courses. The aim of this quantitative study is to explore
   the effectiveness of innovative learning design and use of flipped
   classroom by using Transparent Language Online (TLO) in teaching of
   basic English courses to undergraduate students. A needs-specific
   learning design was crafted integrating pedagogy with computer-mediated
   technology that can effectively cater to students' individual
   deficiencies rather than adopting a universal, one-size-fits-all model.
   A standard assessment task (involving the identification and correction
   of 12 common errors in English language) was implemented. The study was
   conducted with 270 students, composed of 90 students from each of three
   different sections. Random stratified sampling was used for the
   selection of the student sections of each course, and census sampling
   was used for the selection of students from each section. The results
   reflected heightened student interest and motivation in learning,
   resulting in improved academic performance. The study concludes that
   need-based learning design with integration of technology works best to
   teach basic English courses to undergraduate students.},

Title = {Assessing the Educational Environment of a Flipped Physical Therapy
   Course: Utilization of the Dundee Ready Education Environment Measure
   (DREEM)},
Journal = {INTERNET JOURNAL OF ALLIED HEALTH SCIENCES AND PRACTICE},
Year = {2018},

Abstract = {Purpose: Using valid and reliable measures to assess curricula within
   health professions programs has gained significant attention in recent
   years. The educational environment is considered a key domain for
   student success. The primary aim of this study was to measure the
   educational environment following the addition of a flipped classroom
   model within a physical therapy course as measured by the Dundee Ready
   Education Environment Measure. Methods: A first-year doctorate of
   physical therapy course, Physical Agents, was redesigned to include a
   flipped classroom model, incorporating 24 videos that students reviewed
   independently, prior to hands-on laboratory learning. Following the
   conclusion of the course, students (n = 57) completed the Dundee Ready
   Education Environment Measure, a valid and reliable survey designed to
   measure the educational environment within health profession programs.
   The Dundee Ready Education Environment Measure contains 50 items, rated
   from 0 to 4 (fivepoint Likert scale, 0 = strongly disagree to 4 =
   strongly agree), assessing five domains: students' perceptions of
   learning, perceptions of teachers, academic self-perception, perceptions
   of atmosphere, and social self-perception. Descriptive statistics
   included mean global score (out of 200, 151 to 200 being an excellent
   environment) mean domain scores, and mean item scores. Cumulative grade
   point average between students in the flipped classroom model (n = 58)
   and those who previously received a traditional teaching model (n = 59)
   for the course were also compared. Student's t test was utilized with
   significance accepted at p < .05. Results: The mean global score (168
   +/- 13.3) indicated that the flipped classroom model fostered an
   excellent educational environment. Additionally, all mean domain scores,
   including students' perceptions of learning (41.3 +/- 3.9), perceptions
   of teachers (39.2 +/- 2.9), academic self-perception (25.1 +/- 2.5),
   perception of atmosphere (40.1 +/- 4.1), and social self-perception
   (22.1 +/- 2.9), fell into the highest rank of each subscale. Individual
   item analysis demonstrated 26 items (52\%) were identified as especially
   strong areas, five items (10\%) were identified as areas that could be
   improved, and no individual items were identified as requiring
   particular concern or immediate attention. Further, no significant
   differences were seen in cumulative course grade point average between
   the flipped classroom model (3.74 +/- 0.44) and the traditional teaching
   model (3.71 +/- 0.46). Conclusions: Utilizing an online learning
   environment, the flipped classroom model fostered an excellent
   educational environment for the physical therapy Physical Agents class.
   No difference in course grade point average between the flipped
   classroom model and previous traditional teaching model was seen.
   Further investigations in which performance is examined for didactic and
   psychomotor activities within the flipped classroom model are
   recommended.},

Abstract = {This article evaluates learners' thinking in the complex environment of
   teaching level and cognitive construct process and examines learners
   within the framework of cognitive factors, as well as the degree of
   consistency in the training process, in the social practice as the
   teaching of teachers and students to provide timely and dynamic
   feedback, first of all to ``evidence centered{''} education evaluation
   of design patterns and cognitive framework theory as the theoretical
   basis. An evaluation model based on learners' cognitive network analysis
   is designed and constructed by integrating cognitive visualization
   analysis techniques such as network analysis. Secondly, at the beginning
   of action research, the teaching framework structure sequence is
   established under the guidance of the implementation model of flipped
   classroom, and the investigation results of the current situation are
   designed under the guidance of operational steps and organizational
   strategies, and categories and autonomous learning theories are divided,
   so as to preliminarily construct strategies to improve the ability of
   autonomous learning. Then through three rounds of iterative action
   research to improve the flip classroom teaching middle school students'
   autonomous learning ability of teaching strategy, the interview method
   is used; the questionnaire and autonomous learning process to improve
   the students' autonomous learning ability training effect evaluation
   questionnaire is analyzed, and finally a complete set of reverse
   ascending of classroom teaching is formed to improve students'
   autonomous learning ability of effective classroom strategies.},

Abstract = {Recently, the idea of the Fourth Industrial Revolution (FIR) is
   increasingly shaping discussions about the world of work and society. In
   order to prepare the next generations for such new developments, it is
   necessary to adjust the way they learn. One possibility for a change in
   education is Flipped Classroom Approaches (FCA), which are particularly
   helpful in mathematics education. The aim of our research is to identify
   essential pillars for teachers, when they are being familiarised with
   FCA. Therefore, we have chosen a research method that integrates various
   approaches and diverse data sources. The data from a first sequence o f
   expert interviews indicate, that regulatory changes, the recognition of
   one's own learning and its added value, as well as being a member of a
   learner group are crucial in those cases, where the topic of teacher
   training utilise both student-centred and technology-enhanced forms of
   learning. Thus, it would be necessary to modify in-service teacher
   training in Austria and beyond to utilise FCA.},

Title = {The Effect of Flipped Classroom on Iranian Adolescents: Elementary EFL
   Learners' Vocabulary Recall and Retention},
Journal = {EDUCATION RESEARCH INTERNATIONAL},
Year = {2021},
Volume = {2021},
Month = {DEC 6},
Abstract = {Vocabulary as an inseparable part of language learning has a vital role
   in communication, which requires to be taught in new approaches. A
   quasi-experimental method was used to achieve the aims of the current
   study. In doing this, 48 Iranian female adolescent elementary learners
   (13-17) were assigned based on the Oxford Quick Placement Test from 70
   female students to take part in 4 sessions of treatment. The
   participants were randomly divided into two groups: an experimental
   group (n = 24) and a control group (n = 24). The experimental group was
   taught using the flipped classroom, while the control group was exposed
   to the conventional methods. Research instruments involving an English
   language placement test, vocabulary pretest, immediate posttest, and
   delayed test (the study lasted for 9 weeks). A list of 28 target words
   was given to both groups. Words were selected by the Lawshe content
   validity ratio (CVR) and content validity index (CVI) to have validity.
   The findings of ANCOVA indicated that conducting the flipped classrooms
   has significant impacts on Iranian adolescent elementary students'
   vocabulary recall and retention. Hence, it is an applicable approach
   that carries important implications for teachers, foreign language
   syllabus designers, and curriculum planners.},

Abstract = {The purpose of this research is to enrich the process of developing the
   basic language skills of 4th grade students with digital story
   activities and games based on the Flipped Classroom Model (FCM). This
   study was conducted with 4th grade students in a Turkish course. It was
   based on action research. The Turkish courses were prepared according to
   the FCM. The aim was to develop basic language skills of the students
   with various activities. This study focused on digital story and games.
   For the digital story activity, the students prepared some scenes of the
   text they wrote with play dough, took pictures and recorded their voices
   by reading the text aloud. After that, they sent them to the researcher
   via WhatsApp. After gathering the material, digital stories were
   converted into a video. Before the game based activities, some texts and
   grammar topics were presented to the students. Then, some games were
   played in the classroom to reinforce the newly acquired knowledge. In
   conclusion, with the use of FCM, by enriching with digital story and
   game-based activities teaching-learning processes in Turkish courses,
   the development of students in many areas, firstly basic language
   skills, then cognitive, emotional, social and psychomotor skills were
   contributed.},

Abstract = {This article is aimed at exploring students' learnrning achievement,
   motivation, and receptivity towards the flipped classroom in a
   university engineering mathematics course with a quasi-experimental
   design. Moreover, the study compared a half-semester flipped classroom
   and a traditional classroom whereby the experimental class reverted to
   the traditional format after the midterm for assessing students'
   receptivity towards two learning environments. Four assessments, two
   surveys, repeated semi-structured interviews, and two sets of open-ended
   questions were collected. The findings revealed that student learning
   achievement and motivation were improved according to assessment scores
   by the application of the flipped classroom. However, student's
   receptivity towards flipping varied because of the large amount of time
   and effort spent on the course. Students in the experimental group also
   showed insignificant differences after returning to a traditional
   classroom. The study suggests that blended flipped and traditional
   programs are scheduled together to increase student receptivity.},

Title = {Impact on Twitter of active methodologies PBL, flipped classroom and

Abstract = {Twitter is a social network where users interact in a common digital
   space, forming connections that, in themselves, configure, in turn,
   their own interaction networks based on the exchange of content. This
   paper has addressed this issue around the impact that active
   methodologies have on Twitter. For this, we carried out an investigation
   where the technique of social network analysis was used, both in the
   analysis of the type of message as well as its graphic representation.
   The active methodologies analyzed have been project-based learning
   (PBL), the Flipped Classroom and gamification through the corresponding
   hashtags, tweets and retweets. The results have allowed us to know the
   degree of repercussion and analysis of the relationships that have been
   established between the different Twitter users about active
   methodologies, as well as to check which of them has greater relevance,
   and who is behind this interest in the active methodologies. It is
   concluded that, when a user adopts a leading role by retweeting other
   account tweets, it favors that the tweets and re tweets themselves are
   more visible and, in turn, more retweeted. Regarding the network
   structures that are configured for each active methodology, we can say
   that they do not follow a single model, although all of them conform to
   the classification proposed by Himelboim, Smith, Rainie, Shneiderman and
   Espina (2017).},

Abstract = {A promising method of flipped classroom technology is becoming
   increasingly popular among higher education teachers. Flipping the
   classroom is considered to be a sufficient approach for best time
   spreading in-class by actively engaging students during practical
   lessons. The article examines flipped classroom technology
   implementation on the grounds of adaptive online technology. A detailed
   algorithm of actions on the work of a studied online resource is
   developed. The study explores the ability of students to work under the
   conditions of flipping the classroom by means of adaptive learning
   technology empirically. Efficiency criteria of learning technology
   application are identified and described. Lesson planning of both
   experimental and control groups is shown in details. Research data
   demonstrate adaptive technology integration into flipped classroom
   method as a successful approach for higher education teachers who can
   develop their own style for flipping their instructions. It is
   established that the studied joint technologies demonstrate an efficient
   impact on the development of communicative skills.},

Abstract = {Flipped classrooms are becoming increasingly popular, particularly when
   teaching non-native speaking students. Existing research has largely
   focused on examining academic performance and students' perceptions of
   the learning process. This exploratory study uses log-file data to
   identify hidden patterns of student online behaviour in a flipped
   classroom environment for a cohort of students, with special attention
   to their command of the home language of the institution. Using cluster
   analysis, categories were identified regarding when and how often online
   flipped lessons were accessed: (i) before class, (ii) after class and
   before a weekly exam, and (iii) after the weekly exam but before an
   assignment. Gender and the average number of minutes the lessons were
   accessed before each time period were also considered. Findings
   indicated that there was sustained access to flipped materials
   throughout the semester for all students. In addition to accessing
   online lessons prior to class, students also accessed online lessons
   prior to weekly exams and project submission deadlines, indicating the
   value of such material for revision. Interestingly, two clusters of
   non-native English-speakers were identified where one group accessed the
   material more often than native students, and the second group accessed
   the material less frequently than the native English-speaking students.},

Abstract = {The ``flipped classroom{''} teaching paradigm not only follows the
   cognitive rules of the learners, but it also subverts and reverses the
   standard classroom teaching process. Problem-oriented, teacher-led,
   student-centered, and mixed teaching approaches are the key teaching
   methods in the flipped classroom teaching model, which focuses on
   students' procedural knowledge acquisition and critical thinking
   training. There are a lot of studies on the specific practice path of
   the ``flipped classroom{''} teaching style right now, but there are not
   many on the learning involvement of college English students in this
   approach. According to studies, the level of student participation in
   classroom learning is the most important factor limiting the efficiency
   of teaching. The lack of research in this subject greatly limits the
   ``flipped classroom{''} teaching model's ability to improve college
   English classroom teaching quality. The degree of engagement between
   teachers and students, the enthusiasm of students in class, and the
   competence of teachers to educate are all reflected in student conduct
   in the classroom. Understanding and evaluating the behaviors and
   activities of students in the classroom are helpful in determining the
   state of students in the classroom, as well as improving the flipped
   classroom teaching technique and quality. As a result, the convolutional
   neural network is used to recognize student behavior in the classroom.
   The loss function of VGG-16 has been enhanced, the distance inside the
   class has been lowered, the distance between classes has been increased,
   and the recognition accuracy has improved. Accurate recognition of
   classroom behavior is beneficial in developing methods to improve
   teaching quality.},

Abstract = {Preclass learning, an obstacle in the success of a flipped classroom, is
   addressed via placing lessons on an online adaptive platform. The
   lessons combine the power of video lectures, textbook content,
   simulations, and assessments while using personalized paths for each
   student. This article describes the development of the adaptive lessons
   for a course in Numerical Methods, and the interpretation of the
   analytic data collected via the adaptive lesson platform and student
   focus groups over a two-semester period with 146 students. Analytical
   data includes student metrics, such as the lesson scores and the time
   spent and lesson metrics, such as the percentage of students who
   completed the lesson and the percentage of possible adaptive paths used
   by students. The focus groups were conducted for two different
   demographic groupsstudents who are white males (comprise the majority of
   students in public engineering schools in the USA) and other than white
   malesto compare their perspectives on adaptive learning. Students in the
   focus group of the other than white male pupils demonstrated more
   favorable and positive perspectives towards the adaptive learning
   compared with the white males, although both groups identified benefits
   with the adaptive platform. Final examination scores were found to be
   correlated with the raw score of the adaptive lessons.},

Abstract = {Background: Flipped classroom (FC) style Australian faculty development
   program Teaching on the Run (TOTR) was introduced into Chang Gung
   Memorial Hospital since 2014. However, its effectiveness in Taiwan has
   not been formally assessed. This work intended to examine the learning
   gain of TOTR and identify the moderators of FC outcome by using TOTR as
   a representative model of FC.
   Methods: A non-controlled before-after study was undertaken by
   retrospective analysis of learning data collected during TOTR workshop.
   Multiple choice questions were tested at baseline (pre-test), after
   pre-class learning (mid-test) and after classroom activity (post-test)
   to assess the learning gain. All available demographic and learning
   variables were included in the moderator analysis.
   Results: Stepwise and significant improvement in exam scores was noted
   from pre-test to mid-test and post-test (p < 0.001 for both). Univariate
   analysis showed pre-test scores, mid-test scores, class participation
   and session of TOTR were significantly associated with post-test scores.
   However, multivariate analysis by general linear model showed only
   mid-test scores and session of TOTR were significant predictor of
   post-test score. Generalized estimating equations analysis showed that
   class participation is a significant moderator that influence the scores
   change from mid-test to post-test.
   Conclusion: TOTR is effective in improving knowledge of teaching skills
   for clinical teachers in Taiwan. Achievement in pre-class learning,
   class participation and learner factor are potential moderators of the
   FC outcome. Thus, facilitators should try their best to promote a good
   achievement in pre-class learning and engagement in classroom activity
   in FC style learning.},

Abstract = {In this paper, we investigate the multiple attribute decision making
   problems with the intuitionistic trapezoidal fuzzy information. Some
   operational laws of intuitionistic trapezoidal fuzzy numbers are
   introduced. Then, we proposed the some Einstein information aggregating
   operators with intuitionistic trapezoidal fuzzy information including
   intuitionistic trapezoidal fuzzy Einstein weighted averaging (ITFEWA)
   operator, intuitionistic trapezoidal fuzzy Einstein ordered weighted
   averaging (ITFEOWA) operator and intuitionistic trapezoidal fuzzy
   Einstein hybrid aggregation (ITFEHA) operator, are proposed. An approach
   to multiple attribute decision making with intuitionistic trapezoidal
   fuzzy information is developed based on the ITFEWA operator. Finally, an
   illustrative example for evaluating the teaching effect of the college
   English public speaking course under the flipped classroom hybrid
   teaching mode is given to verify the developed approach.},

Abstract = {The purpose of this study is to determine the impact of the flipped
   classroom method on student motivation and what related factors increase
   and decrease motivation. The study followed the mixed research method
   and the sample of the study consisted of 116 first grade early childhood
   education undergraduate students at a university in Turkey. This study
   was conducted in an introductory computer course. The flipped classroom
   method is compared to traditional techniques in this study. Data were
   collected through semi-structured interviews and a course interest
   survey in this 10-week mixed method study. Inferential and descriptive
   analysis methods were applied to the data. An independent samples t-test
   was used to determine the difference between experimental and control
   groups in terms of motivation. The interviews were analyzed with
   descriptive analysis method. Results showed that students who were
   trained with the flipped classroom method had more motivation than
   students who were trained with traditional methods. Students reported
   that hands-on in-class activities, group work, and gamification
   activities increased their motivation. Additionally, students reported
   that the difficulty level of in-class activities, watching videos, and
   dealing with the course outside of the classroom decreased their
   motivation. Consequently, when designed effectively, the flipped
   classroom method can increase the students' motivation towards the
   course. Also, suggestions for practitioners were discussed in this
   study.},

Title = {Effect of Teaching with Flipped Class-room Model: A Meta Analysis},
Journal = {FWU JOURNAL OF SOCIAL SCIENCES},
Year = {2021},
Volume = {15},
Number = {3},
Pages = {96-112},
Abstract = {The flipped classroom model has been used by a number of the teachers
   for active learning and better understanding of the students. In this
   approach, the students learn the video-based subject content prior to
   in-class session and participate in collaborative learning activities
   during the class. The class time is utilized for activities, games and
   discussion. This model is increasingly used for teaching and learning
   purpose in developed countries where technology is highly integrated in
   education. This article is meta-analysis of already conducted
   experimental studies to highlights the academic, social and emotional
   development of students during experiments. The reviewed articles were
   searched on 4 data bases and 12 journal articles, based on
   experimentation. These articles contained a variety of the subjects
   taught to students from primary level to Higher education. The results
   suggested that students in flipped classroom were more active, engaged,
   motivated, and interactive and academically they were better performer.
   It is concluded that flipped classroom model increases academic
   achievement and improve social and emotional development of students.
   However there are some limitations of the flipped classroom model as
   students are not aware of self-learning/autonomous learning. Teachers
   need training for material selection, development, and presentation in
   videos. The review of qualitative researches would explore more benefits

Abstract = {This paper presents the results of two different experiences about
   computational thinking acquisition, gained within a formal subject
   taught in a multidisciplinary (Digital Humanities) master program of a
   face-to-face teaching university of Spain, following a blended learning
   approach and using flipped classroom techniques. These results have been
   obtained after imparting lecturing this subject for two consecutive
   academic years, with similar but distinctive methodologies each. In
   effect, even though both of them can be considered task-based (or,
   alternatively, learning-by-doing-based), the first one has focused on
   group learning and has been inspired by the computer engineering
   technique of evolutionary prototyping; whereas the second one builds
   upon individual learning and case-based (or example-based) learning.
   Thus, the paper details the parameters defined for each experience and
   methodology (that is, the participants, the materials, the procedures
   and the evaluation criteria), together with the main conclusions drawn
   from this study like, for instance, that group learning has not helped
   as much as individual learning (at least in this case) identify and
   correct the errors that occurred while assimilating the contents of the
   subject.},

Abstract = {Background This study aimed to investigate the benefits and challenges
   of the flipped classroom combined with team-, case-, lecture- and
   evidence-based learning (FC-TCLEBL) for ophthalmology teaching for
   eight-year program students. Methods FC-TCLEBL and the traditional
   lecture-based classroom (LBC) were compared based on student and teacher
   feedback questionnaires, student learning burden, and scores on
   standardized tests as well as their effects on the abilities of clinical
   thinking, scientific research, active-learning, practical application,
   humanistic care and communication with patients. Results Both the
   students and teachers were more satisfied with the FC-TCLEBL model. More
   students in the FC-TCLEBL group agreed that the course helped them to
   develop skills in creative thinking, problem solving, and teamwork.
   Students in the FC-TCLEBL group spent significantly more time preparing
   for class than those in the LBC group, but the time spent on review was
   significantly lower in the FC-TCLEBL group. The students from the
   FC-TCLEBL group performed better in a post-test on diabetic retinopathy
   (DR) as compared to the LBC group. Conclusions FC-TCLEBL teaching model
   is effective and suitable for ophthalmology teaching.},

Abstract = {This paper reports on a study that investigated whether a flipped
   classroom approach enhanced perceptions of levels of engagement and
   skill performance among students enrolled in a Blackboard course at a
   Saudi university. Fifty-eight participants were divided into control and
   experimental groups, which were taught using a traditional and a flipped
   approach respectively. To determine the effect of the approach on
   participants' perceived levels of engagement and skill performance,
   questionnaires were administered and student performance was examined in
   terms of quantitative descriptive analysis. The results revealed that
   participants in the experimental group were more active and engaged
   compared with those in the control group. In terms of classroom
   engagement specifically, participants in the experimental group
   exhibited greater behavioral and emotional engagement. Through the
   flipped approach, participants were able to study course content at home
   first, thereby preparing themselves to participate in relevant class
   activities, pose questions and engage in problem solving with peers. In
   addition, unlike in a traditional lecture, the instructor was able to
   move freely through the classroom, providing direct assistance to
   participants on a case-by-case basis.},

Abstract = {Flipped Classroom as a pedagogical framework has gained popularity at
   secondary and tertiary levels of mathematics education, but there is a
   lack of research based on a solid theoretical foundation. This article
   considers the flipped mathematics classroom from the perspective of
   affordances and cultural-historical activity theory. The empirical
   background is based on semi-structured interview data from eight
   first-year computer-engineering students following 1 year of flipped
   classroom teaching. The thematic analysis of the data indicates that the
   flipped format offers a range of affordances at various levels of the
   activity system. This article advances research on affordances for
   mathematical learning in a flipped classroom pedagogical frame,
   presenting operational affordances out-of-class, action affordances at
   the mathematical task level and finally activity affordances at the
   collective level.},

   teaching of psychology. Evidence regarding the effectiveness of the
   inverted teaching model is reviewed and an argument for its use within
   graduate-level psychology courses is provided. Two examples of
   graduate-level psychology courses (i.e., cognitive abilities and

Abstract = {Aims: The flipped classroom (FC) model utilizes pre-class foundational
   learning with in-class higher-order application exercises. FC approaches
   have reported positive perceptions and mixed academic performance
   outcomes in medical education; however, little evidence exists on their
   impact in the 56-week didactic curriculum of Physician Assistant (PA)
   education. Methods: A 4-week FC curriculum was piloted in a PA
   behavioral medicine course (n?=?34). Before class, students completed
   online video modules. During class, students completed a pre-class quiz
   and answered clinical case-based questions in a think-pair-share format.
   Results: Students rated in-class time higher than a lecture-based
   segment of the same course (p?=?0.028). Assessment of achievement
   emotions demonstrated increased enjoyment (p?=?0.028) and decreased
   boredom (p?<?0.001) in the FC curriculum with no difference in anxiety.
   The FC curriculum produced a 57.2?min increase in pre-class preparation
   time with no change in post-class studying time. Compared to historical
   lecture-based controls (n?=?35), students in the FC curriculum scored
   significantly higher on clinical vignette questions (p?=?0.019) with
   equivalent performance on other question formats. Conclusions: This
   study offers the first positive outcomes of an FC approach in PA
   education and provides a framework for improving academic performance
   while scaling back in-class time.},

   emerging technology. The current study aims to examine the effect of
   implementing the Flipped Classroom Model (FCM) on the motivation level
   of Omani EFL (English as a Foreign Language) learners to speak English.
   A mixed methods approach was used in this quasi experimental study. In
   the quantitative dimension, a Motivation in English Speaking Performance
   Questionnaire (MESPQ) was distributed in three phases: before, during,
   and after the application of FCM over a period of 15 weeks. Furthermore,
   in the qualitative dimension, reflective journal forms were collected to
   obtain more in-depth information. The sample group studied comprised 27
   students majoring in English in the Advanced Communication Skills course
   at Buraimi University College (BUC). The findings showed that using FCM
   as a teaching approach helped to develop a creative, engaging, and
   motivating climate in the EFL speaking class. Significant differences (p
   < 0.001) in students' motivation levels before and during the
   implementation of FCM indicated that FCM contributed significantly to
   increasing students' motivation in English speaking performance over
   time. Besides, the Omani EFL students showed significantly greater
   inclination to be involved in the speaking activities over time,
   including their interest in applying FCM in all taught courses. Further
   studies on FCM could focus specifically on its effect on learners'
   achievement.},

Abstract = {In this paper, we investigate the multiple attribute decision making
   problems with the intuitionistic trapezoidal fuzzy information. Some
   operational laws of intuitionistic trapezoidal fuzzy numbers are
   introduced. Then, we proposed the some Einstein information aggregating
   operators with intuitionistic trapezoidal fuzzy information including
   intuitionistic trapezoidal fuzzy Einstein weighted averaging (ITFEWA)
   operator, intuitionistic trapezoidal fuzzy Einstein ordered weighted
   averaging (IT-FEOWA) operator and intuitionistic trapezoidal fuzzy
   Einstein hybrid aggregation (ITFEHA) operator, are proposed. An approach
   to multiple attribute decision making with intuitionistic trapezoidal
   fuzzy information is developed based on the ITFEWA operator. Finally, an
   illustrative example for evaluating the teaching effect of the college
   English public speaking course under the flipped classroom hybrid
   teaching mode is given to verify the developed approach.},

Abstract = {This research paper investigates the effectiveness of combined Flipped
   Classroom (FC) and Problem-based Learning (PBL) teaching approach in a
   computer programming module. Combined FC-PBL makes use of learning
   technologies and supports authentic learning in terms of authentic
   context, multiple perspectives through team work and collaboration. FC
   involves watching educational videos prior to class session, and using
   the class session for practical tasks, thus supporting programming
   skills development. PBL enables authentic learning activities through
   group work and helps students to develop 21st century skills such as
   self-direction, collaboration, creativity and innovation. A research
   case study was conducted that considered a three-stage based delivery of
   the module that involved traditional, only FC, and combined FC-PBL
   teaching approaches applied on a number of programming topics. Both the
   educational and edutainment benefits were analyzed. The results show
   that combined FC-PBL approach is effective and the knowledge acquired by
   students improves, in particular, for the weaker students. Only 1.9\% of
   students have scored an assessment mark lower than 40\% compared to
   28.3\% and 24.5\% when the traditional teaching and FC-only approaches
   respectively were used. Overall, a 26.56\% increase in the assessment
   results was noticed when combined FC-PBL was used. The edutainment
   element was investigated through a questionnaire that assessed learning
   environment, engagement, learner satisfaction and whether the students
   have enjoyed learning sessions. The survey analysis shows that the
   combined FC-PBL approach does aid in the edutainment of mature students
   and provides an enjoyable learning experience.},

Abstract = {This study aims at exploring Interactive Videos (IV) used in Flipped
   Classroom (FC) and their feedback types and Learning Styles (LS) of
   Talented Students (TS) in developing Personal Knowledge Management
   Skills (PKMS) and achievement. The study was conducted on 51 STS from
   Hail Gifted Care Center in KSA, where they divided into four
   experimental groups depending on their LS and IV's feedback. The study
   occurred during the first term of the academic year 2019-2020. In the FC
   based on IV, no statistical differences between the TF and AF were
   present in interactive videos on the achievement or PKMS for talented
   students. Also, no statistical differences between the LS
   (convergent-distant) in the total PKMS and achievement for STS were
   present when applying interactive videos-based flipped classrooms, same
   for statistical interaction effects between the TF-AF, save for some
   interaction effects in some knowledge management skills (conveying,
   analysis, organizing). Future research could address the diminishing
   motivation incurred with the interactive videos-based flipped
   classrooms. Specifically, how to design IV-based FCs with feedback types
   that encourage students to develop KPMS},

Abstract = {The ``flipped classroom{''} has become a popular teaching method.
   Students watch video lectures before class, saving time for active
   learning (problem solving, demonstrations, applications, and so forth).
   This article provides a useful guide for busy professors who would like
   to try the flipped-classroom approach. Recommendations for four teaching
   components are given: 1) planning the flipped classroom, 2) video
   lectures, 3) active learning, and 4) student-centered formative
   assessment. It includes suggestions for getting started with the
   flipped-teaching method, case studies from electromagnetics (EM), and
   feedback from students about the resources they find most useful, their
   comfort level with asking questions, and their opinions of the flipped
   class during the semester. Training materials for flipping your
   classroom (or helping others do so) are available at
   http://teach-flip.utah.edu.},

Abstract = {This article presents the results of an innovation experience carried
   out with first year students of the Primary Education Teacher's Degree.
   Based on global trends in favour of curricular methodologies to
   encouragethe development of autonomous and collaborative learning
   capacities in students, a group of teacher's members of the Educational
   Innovation Group EIE-GID, who teach in the subject School Organization
   and Resources in Education, has sought a progressive graduation in the
   difficulty and prominence to be assumed by the students in the learning
   tasks. The aim was to overcome the dichotomy of theoretical classes and
   practical classes, contemplating different methodologies, but sharing
   their features: foster student autonomy, seek motivation, take risks and
   develop alternative responses, promoting responsibility, with options to
   experiment and encourage the development of an attitude of permanent
   improvement. To do this, tasks are proposed that allowed to face
   unforeseen events, take initiatives, be responsible and autonomous,
   mobilize resources, communicate and relate effectively and assess the
   effects of their own decisions critically, so that the last topics were
   developed based on in the Flipped Classroom methodological strategy. At
   the same time, an information collection and evaluation protocol were
   designed for the students to assess the process and the results
   obtained. The answers given show that, in spite of the positive
   evaluation of the experience, the students demand the need for
   expository classes to clarify the doubts about contents.},

Abstract = {Although many educators have recently discussed the positive effects of
   flipped learning, there is little empirical evidence about whether this
   approach can actually promote students' English learning. This study was
   undertaken in four sections of the same College English 1 (E1) course
   over two consecutive semesters at a South Korean university. A total of
   79 students enrolled in the E1 course participated in the study. Of the
   participants, 39 learned English using a communicative language teaching
   approach, whereas 40 studied English in a flipped learning manner. Data
   were gathered from the students' achievements in three major tasks,
   their responses to three surveys, and the instructor's notes on the
   students' engagement in the process of their English learning. Findings
   demonstrate that the students in the flipped classroom achieved higher
   average scores in their final three tasks than those in the non-flipped
   classroom, but only the final examination mean score indicated
   statistical significance. However, surveys indicated that most students
   in this study seemed to enjoy learning English in a flipped learning
   environment. Also, the instructor found the students in the flipped
   classroom to be more engaged in the learning process than those in the
   non-flipped classroom. Pedagogical implications for effective English
   teaching are discussed.},

Abstract = {Introduction: Presenting material in a manner that is most palatable to
   students is important to improve the learning process. We evaluated the
   efficacy of different teaching styles including the flipped classroom
   and assessed the learning style preferences of a cohort of medical
   learners in a preclinical obstetrics and gynecology course.
   Methods: We conducted three teaching sessions with 35 physician
   assistant students. A different teaching style was implemented for each
   session including a traditional lecture with interactive learning
   technology augmentation, a flipped classroom, and a hybrid approach
   incorporating lecture and group work. Students were surveyed using a
   Likert scale regarding the efficacy of the format, clinical relevance of
   the material, and their learning preference for future sessions.
   Results: Students rated the traditional approach as the most effective,
   most relevant, and most preferred method. Students preferred the flipped
   classroom least, but they rated it as slightly more effective and
   relevant than the hybrid approach.
   Conclusion: The teaching style of various coursework including the
   preclinical obstetrics and gynecology curriculum may not need to be
   altered for millennial learners. This study showed the flipped classroom
   was the least favored teaching style and that there was a marked
   preference by students for a more traditional didactic lecture.},

Title = {A Review of Nontraditional Teaching Methods: Flipped Classroom,
   Gamification, Case Study, Self-Learning, and Social Media},
Journal = {EDUCATION SCIENCES},
Year = {2019},
Volume = {9},

Abstract = {Traditional teaching methods rely solely on the use of textbooks, but
   teaching effectiveness assessment methods have demonstrated that most
   students taught by this method do not absorb the course content up to
   the expected level. Multiple researchers have introduced nontraditional
   teaching methods, but there is no scientific consensus on the best
   nontraditional teaching methods that are tailored to learners' abilities
   while most effectively addressing the course objectives. Therefore, the
   goal of this review was to address the following questions across all
   engineering disciplines, based on learners' abilities and the course
   objectives: (a) What are the benefits of nontraditional teaching
   methods? and (b) How would you categorize the benefits of nontraditional
   teaching methods? A qualitative review was conducted to achieve these
   goals, and the initial search for papers, using relevant keywords,
   resulted in more than 2000 peer-reviewed articles that were published
   between 2000 and 2017. A total of 125 peer-reviewed articles pertaining
   to the most frequently studied nontraditional teaching methods were
   comprehensively studied and analyzed. The analysis resulted in practical
   guidelines, including a list of the benefits of the five studied
   nontraditional teaching methods (flipped classroom, gamification, case
   study, self-learning, and social media) belonging to four categories:
   technical/professional, personal skills/ability, personal attitude, and
   time and space. Based on the results, the authors established
   significant guidelines for instructors who aim to optimize learners'
   achievements by adopting the most effective teaching styles, based on
   their course objectives and the learners' abilities.},

Title = {A Theoretical Analysis of the Effectiveness of Sports Flipped Class
   Teaching Based on Motor Skill Learning},
Journal = {SCIENTIFIC PROGRAMMING},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {2022},
Month = {FEB 8},
Abstract = {This article compares the characteristics and advantages of flipped
   sports classrooms with other disciplines and traditional sports
   classrooms, and analyzes the characteristics and advantages of flipped
   sports classrooms, using the method of experimental comparison and
   comparative analysis to sort out the characteristics of Flipped classes
   in the application of teaching practice. Adjusting the teaching process
   and structure, with sports skill teaching as the main line, can create
   conditions for the deepening and expansion of PE. Students are the main
   body in a flipped class, which confirms the teaching concept. With the
   advent of the Internet era, students can access the information network
   at any time and from any location to gain PE knowledge. To meet
   students' learning needs, teachers must interact with them more and
   grasp teaching feedback more quickly. To sort out and research flipped
   classroom teaching in physical education, compare the use of flipped
   classroom teaching in physical education to traditional PE teaching over
   time, and demonstrate that flipped classroom teaching in physical
   education should be based on sports skills teaching and the teaching
   process. Making the necessary adjustments can help students learn in a
   positive environment. Then it examines two levels of technology and
   operation implementation in order to provide theoretical support for
   Flipped classroom teaching and improve student learning efficiency.},

Title = {Analysis of Effectiveness and Performance Prediction of Sports Flipped
   Classroom Teaching Based on Neural Networks},
Journal = {SCIENTIFIC PROGRAMMING},
Year = {2021},
Volume = {2021},
Month = {JUL 31},
Abstract = {Traditional physical education methods are unable to meet this
   requirement due to the practical nature of sports skill teaching. As a
   result, as the times demanded, the flipped classroom based on neural
   network technology arose. It has the potential to not only promote the
   modernization of physical education but also to ensure that it has a
   positive educational impact. This is a mode of instruction. Furthermore,
   colleges and universities are increasingly focusing on college students'
   overall quality development. A method for predicting college students'
   sports performance using a particle swarm optimization neural network is
   proposed to accurately predict sports performance and provide a reliable
   analysis basis for the establishment of sports teaching goals. Neural
   networks are used in the model. The particle swarm optimization
   algorithm optimizes the variance and weights of the neural network to
   improve the accuracy of college students' sports performance predicted
   by the neural network by updating the particle position and speed
   through the two extreme values of individual extreme values and global
   extreme values. Teachers always play the role of the facilitator and
   helper in the teaching process, which realizes the transformation of
   teachers' and students' self-positioning, allows students to better play
   the lead role, and stimulates students' interest in learning.},

   this approach to two Extension programs in which citizen scientists are

   tool of flipped classrooms is to accommodate large amounts of content
   while focusing classroom time on skills development. In 2017, we
   assessed efficacy of the flipped classroom through knowledge tests and
   surveys completed by 174 participants and 106 participants,
   respectively. Results demonstrated large knowledge gains and high
   participant satisfaction. We encourage Extension professionals to
   consider whether use of the flipped classroom format could advance
   achievement of their programs' learning objectives.},

Title = {Flipped classroom combined with case-based learning is an effective
   teaching modality in nephrology clerkship},
Journal = {BMC MEDICAL EDUCATION},
Year = {2021},
Volume = {21},
Number = {1},
Month = {MAY 15},
Abstract = {Background The flipped classroom (FC) is recognized as an effective
   teaching approaches by emphasizing on the development of high-order
   abilities; however, the implementation of FC has not been well explored
   in nephrology education. The present study aims to investigate the
   efficacy of FC in teaching nephrology via comparing with the traditional
   lecture-based teaching (LBT). Methods Sixty-two medical clerkship
   students at Zhejiang University School of Medicine were equally
   allocated into either LBT or FC group demographically matched. The
   glomerular diseases module was chosen for the teaching content. Students
   from the FC group were required to study the pre-class materials in
   annotated PPT format in advance. In the class, case-based learning (CBL)
   was employed, students encountered the related clinical cases and
   participated in the face-to -face discussion. Students from the LBT
   group attended a didactic lecture during the class. Quiz and
   questionnaires were performed to assess the efficacy of FC versus LBT.
   Results Participants from the FC group performed better in the quiz than
   those from the LBT group with higher total scores (78.06 +/- 2.515 vs.
   65.16 +/- 3.209, mean +/- SEM), particularly the scores of the case
   analysis-related questions (35.81 +/- 1.657 vs. 27.42 +/- 1.910, mean
   +/- SEM). In the survey, more students considered FC beneficial to
   comprehension, critical thinking, patient management and team work as
   compared with LBT. Meanwhile, more participants agreed increased
   in-class pressure in FC than in LBT. Conclusions This study shows the
   positive impact of FC combined with CBL approach on nephrology education
   and provides an alternative pre-class and in-class format for the FC
   implementation.},

Abstract = {This work describes an academic experience of the flipped classroom
   implemented as a strategy in the subject of Promotion, given to students
   of the second semester of Computer Engineering, of the University of
   Guadalajara. The main purpose was to promote the consumption and
   production of educational resources. The application of a didactic
   strategy divided into three moments was planned: classroom inverted with
   resources proposed by the teacher, based on the student's learning
   styles; participation of students in the creation of teaching resources;
   and finally, the evaluation from a descriptive study to a sample of 24
   subjects. During the study, a Likert-type questionnaire was initially
   applied, organized around the methodological perception related to
   learning, the teacher-student interaction, student-student, learning
   rhythms, collaboration, problem solving, motivation and prosuming
   attitude. The results highlight that 88\% agree on the methodology and
   personalization of learning rhythms; 92\% state that the strategy
   allowed them to improve their learning and communication skills; for the
   previous thing one deduces a greater interaction between them and the
   professor, which developed his critical thought and abilities to solve
   problems; strategies for creating and disseminating content could be
   integrated; the student's motivation to collaborate and check the
   constructivist principle of learning by doing was increased. The
   application of active didactic models requires the conformation of
   learning environments under the principles of the learner's style and
   integrating their interests for the development of their competences.},

Title = {Toward a 5E-Based Flipped Classroom Model for Teaching Computational
   Thinking in Elementary School: Effects on Student Computational Thinking
   and Problem-Solving Performance},
Journal = {JOURNAL OF EDUCATIONAL COMPUTING RESEARCH},
Abstract = {Computational thinking (CT) has attracted significant interest among
   many educators around the globe. Despite this growing interest, research
   on CT and programming education in elementary school remains at an
   initial stage. Many relevant studies have adopted only one type of
   method to assess students' CT, which may lead to an incomplete view of
   student development on CT, while other studies employed small sample
   sizes, which may increase the chance of assuming a false premise to be
   true. Moreover, conventional programming courses typically have two
   limitations (e.g., limited student active learning and student low
   engagement). Given these gaps, this study investigates the effects of a
   theory-based (5E framework) flipped classroom model (FCM) on elementary
   school students' understanding of CT concepts, computational
   problem-solving performance, and perceptions of flipped learning. To
   achieve this, a pretest-posttest quasi-experimental study was conducted
   in a rural elementary school, including 125 students in the experimental
   group and 122 students in the control group. The results showed that the
   5E-based FCM significantly improved student understanding of CT concepts
   and computational problem-solving abilities. The results also revealed
   positive student perception toward the FCM. The benefits and challenges
   of the 5E-based FCM are discussed.},

Abstract = {The accessible Flipped classroom is a two-learning phase model that
   includes pre-class and in-class learning phases accessible using
   standard information technology. The objectives of this study are to
   explore the effectiveness and investigate the students' perceptions
   towards this model to see how the perceptions correlated with the
   success of the model. This study involved 59 sophomores (98.3\% female
   and 1.7\% male) between the ages of 20 to 21 from 2 English presentation
   classes at Walailak University. A pre-test / post-test were conducted to
   see the effectiveness, while a survey questionnaire of 22 closed-ended
   questions and 1 open-ended question was given to them at the end of the
   term of 12 weeks. The questions were classified into four aspects of
   perceptions: pre-class learning phase, in-class learning phase, word
   stress pronunciation, and the overall model. The results confirmed the
   effectiveness of this model as the average students' post-test score (M:
   8.38) was notably higher than their pre-test score (M: 7.47). Students'
   perceptions of each of four aspects were also positively high. However,
   as bivariate correlations were performed to examine the relationships
   between the students' perceptions and post-test results, no significant
   correlation was found. The study implied that even though the students
   improved by using the model, they might have needed more time to adapt
   to a more independent learning culture.},

   classroom (FC) on learning, learning retention, and satisfaction among
   operating room students. Methods: This two-group quasi-experimental
   study was conducted in 2018-2019 in the Faculty of Nursing and Midwifery
   of Isfahan University of Medical Sciences, Isfahan, Iran. Forty-four
   operating room students who had enrolled in anesthesiology course were
   selected and randomly allocated to a lecture and a FC group. Data were
   collected using a researcher-made satisfaction questionnaire and two
   researcher-made knowledge examinations. Data analysis was performed
   using the Chi-square, independent-samples t, and paired-samples t-tests.
   Results: The mean scores of knowledge in the first and the second
   examinations in the FC group (i.e. 18.85 +/- 0.83 and 17.47 +/- 1.42,
   respectively) were significantly greater than the corresponding mean
   scores in the lecture group (i.e., 16.21 +/- 1.99 and 12.90 +/- 2.64,
   respectively) (P < 0.05). Moreover, the mean score of satisfaction in
   the FC group was significantly higher than the lecture group (169.44 +/-
   17.82 vs. 115.56 +/- 17.57;P < 0.05). Conclusion: FC is more effective
   than traditional lecture in promoting students' satisfaction and short-
   and long-term learning.},

Abstract = {As an option to help cope with challenges such as differing student
   needs, lack of student interest, and limited contact hours, the
   commercial learning management system (LMS) Blackboard was used to
   support a flipped classroom approach in a first-year English as a
   foreign language course at a large Thai public university. The aims of
   the study were to determine students' perceptions of the course and how
   it affected their second language writing anxiety, in order to improve
   later versions of the course. Data were collected over the course of two
   non-consecutive measures from 272 participants in the first semester and
   141 in the second. Data on students' perceptions and anxiety were
   collected using a questionnaire and the Second Language Writing Anxiety
   Inventory (Cheng, 2004). After quantitative and qualitative analysis,
   results showed that participants' second language writing anxiety was
   not significantly affected by the modified course. Their perceptions of
   the course appeared to be impacted by technological difficulties that
   occurred. The results seem to indicate that frustration with technology
   should be of greater concern when attempting to utilize an LMS or
   similar platform.},

Abstract = {Due to it being generally regarded as an effective pedagogic approach,
   the flipped classroom has been widely applied in various disciplines in
   higher education in many places around the world, but has rarely been
   used in primary English education. This research investigated teacher
   and student perceptions of the impact, feasibility, and potential of the
   flipped EFL classroom by conducting a one-year project among 277
   students and eight teachers in a primary school in Hong Kong. Teacher
   and student reflection, roundtable discussion minutes, and trainer
   observation and logs were employed as means of continual data
   collection. The results showed that the flipped classroom improved the
   teacher-student relationship and teaching and learning performance, and
   increased teacher and student motivation and confidence. This study
   demonstrates the high feasibility of using the flipped classroom for
   primary English education and its great potential for providing students
   with personalized learning, developing their self-regulated learning and
   active learning skills.},

Title = {A multiyear comparison of flipped- vs. lecture-based teaching on student
   success in a pharmaceutical science class},

Abstract = {Background and purpose: To gauge the potential effect of mode of content
   delivery on overall student success in a pharmaceutical sciences course
   in a doctor of pharmacy program.
   Educational activity and setting: Principles of Drug Action I (PDAI) is
   a first-year pharmaceutical science course typically taught by multiple
   faculty, and each utilizes their own approach to deliver course content.
   Over a seven year period, the course naturally separated into blocks.
   Block-1 was taught using a traditional lecture-based approach while
   Block-2 varied between either a lecture-based or a flipped-classroom
   format. Student success was evaluated by exam at the end of each block.
   Findings: For the four years in which Block-2 was taught by lecture, the
   number of exam failures was similar to Block-1. For each of the three
   years Block-2 was taught via the flipped-classroom format, the number of
   exam failures was approximately half that of Block-1. While grades for
   the lecture-based Block-1 trended downward over the seven-year
   evaluation period, average exam grades overall were similar between
   Block-1 and Block-2 each year regardless of teaching modality.
   Summary: Retrospective analysis of this novel blocked approach within
   PDAI provided a means of internally evaluating the potential effect of
   teaching format on overall student performance. The results described
   here support previous studies that indicate that the flipped-classroom
   approach can reduce course failures. These findings also show that
   flipped-classroom teaching may have a greater impact on improving
   learning in lower-performing students.},

Abstract = {A flipped chemistry class for middle school education majors was
   ``unflipped{''} during the conversion from in-person to online-only
   instruction during the beginning of the COVID-19 pandemic. The process
   balanced the best practices of online education with practicality due to
   the short time frame. Successes and failures in the conversion process
   are outlined, with adaptations suggested for failures, and a record of
   the class's social and emotional experience is summarized. Successful
   implementation of checklists and conversion guides increased student
   confidence the class's direction and gave a sense of stability in an
   unstable time. The online component of the flipped classroom is examined
   for its adequacy as an online-only option. Approaches to student
   emotional and mental health are addressed, as well as behavioral issues
   resulting from learning remotely. Difficulties in the conversion
   primarily stemmed from the inability to use hands-on activities and a
   decrease in student engagement. Though external factors most likely
   accounted for the majority of the decrease in engagement, an activity
   and strategies are proposed to increase student buy-in and motivation.
   Finally, this paper includes a discussion of activity choice and
   implementation for increasing the benefits and transparency of
   activities for students working from home.},

Title = {Flipped classroom model applications in computing courses: Peer-assisted
   groups, collaborative group and individual learning},
Journal = {COMPUTER APPLICATIONS IN ENGINEERING EDUCATION},
Abstract = {The Flipped Classroom (FC) provides various opportunities to ensure
   active learning in a student-based learning environment. In the
   literature, it is pointed out that the FC model provided a positive
   contribution to the teaching process when it was used for learning
   environments in past studies. Besides this, it is seen that FC was
   integrated into a learning method and the results were generally
   associated with only FC. From this point of view, it is thought that the
   methodological effect of FC needs to be examined. The aim of this study
   is to identify whether the use of different models (peer-assisted group:
   PAL-FC, collaborative group: SGCL-FC, and individual learning: IL-FC) in
   FC for computing courses of university students has an effect on
   academic performances, learning motivation, academic self-efficacy,
   computer anxiety of the university students, and flipped learning
   readiness. This study is designed with a mixed method. The working group
   of the study is composed of 242 university students. The application
   lasted for 14 weeks. In this study, data have been collected by a
   Personal Information Form, semi-structured interview form, information
   technologies achievement test, and four different data collection tools.
   As a result of the research, it is found out that different applications
   in the FC model have a significant effect on academic success, academic
   self-efficacy, e-learning readiness in FC. FC model application with
   PAL-FC has proved more successful when compared to other methods in
   terms of developing performance and reducing technology anxiety. Also,
   it is seen that motivation and academic self-efficacy in FC has improved
   positively for collaborative group work.},

Title = {Teaching Tip: Designing Flipped Classrooms to Enhance Learning in the
   Clinical Skills Laboratory},
Journal = {JOURNAL OF VETERINARY MEDICAL EDUCATION},
Abstract = {Flipped classroom is an educational technique in which content is
   delivered online for students to study at their own pace in preparation
   for in-class learning. Benefits include increased flexibility, enhanced
   student engagement and satisfaction, and more effective use of time
   spent during face-to-face teaching. However, the development and
   implementation of flipped classroom teaching are also associated with
   challenges, including time required to develop learning materials and
   getting students to engage with the preparatory work. This teaching tip
   describes a structured approach to designing and implementing the
   flipped classroom approach for clinical skills to allow a greater focus
   on practicing the hands-on skills and the provision of feedback during
   the laboratory session. First, the rationale for flipping the classroom
   and the expected benefits should be considered. On a practical level,
   decisions need to be made about what to include in the flipped
   component, how it will complement the face-to-face class, and how the
   resources will be created. In the design phase, adopting a structured
   template and aligning with established pedagogical principles is
   helpful. A well-designed flipped classroom motivates learners by
   including different elements such as quality educational media (e.g.,
   videos), the opportunity to self-assess, and well-defined connections to
   relevant knowledge and skills. Student engagement with the flipped
   material can be promoted through different strategies such as clear
   communication to manage student expectations and adapting the delivery
   of the face-to-face component. Finally, gathering feedback and
   evaluating the initiative are important to inform future improvements.},

Abstract = {The current education methods are mostly based on test-oriented
   education and rarely really care about the content of students'
   concerns, and flipped psychological education methods have appeared in
   some areas. The main purpose of this thesis is to combine artificial
   intelligence and flipped classroom psychology. This article mainly
   introduces the characteristics of artificial intelligence and the
   definition of flipped classroom. What are the advantages of the
   intelligent teaching platform compared to traditional teaching? This
   article selects key 1 class, key 2 class, key 3 class, and key 4 class
   from the students of our school. Groups A1 and B1 conduct a semester of
   artificial intelligence combined with the concept of flipped classroom
   psychology. Groups A2 and B2 teach students in accordance with
   traditional teaching. The experimental results show that the proportion
   of groups A1 and B1 increased by 8.2\% and 8.14\%. The midterm and final
   average scores of groups A1 and B1 are 10.87, 7.2, 14.13, and 12.2
   points higher than those of groups A2 and B2, and their scores have
   increased by 10.3\% and 7.02\%, 12.4\%, and 11.9\%. The mental health
   education course effect of artificial intelligence and flipped classroom
   psychology can more stimulate students' interest and promote the
   improvement of students' performance through autonomous learning.},

Abstract = {Recently there has been a surge of interest in technology-aided teaching
   strategies such as the flipped classroom. Given the growing interest in
   these techniques, it is important to critically evaluate their
   effectiveness and to begin to examine factors that might shape how
   effective the flipped classroom will be in a given educational setting.
   Although most existing research on the flipped classroom suggests an
   advantage of the flipped approach over a more traditional lecture
   approach, most of this research has been conducted in a single
   educational setting at a time and in ways that preclude definitive
   conclusions about the relative effectiveness of the flipped approach. We
   present the results of a study that addressed many of these
   methodological limitations and compared the effectiveness of the flipped
   approach to a traditional lecture approach across two semesters in
   courses from two different disciplines, finance and psychology. We found
   that the effectiveness of the flipped versus the traditional approach
   varied across the two courses. In particular, in the psychology courses
   the flipped approach resulted in superior performance on quizzes
   administered immediately after exposure to course material, but resulted
   in similar performance on exams administered some time after initial
   exposure. In contrast, in the finance courses the flipped approach
   resulted in similar performance on immediately administered quizzes, but
   superior performance on later-administered exams. These results
   contribute to the burgeoning literature on the flipped classroom both by
   addressing methodological limitations found in previous work and by
   identifying some of the specific conditions under which the flipped
   approach may be a good pedagogical choice.},

Title = {A Systematic Review of Self-Regulated Learning in Flipped Classrooms:
   Key Findings, Measurement Methods, and Potential Directions},
Journal = {IEEE ACCESS},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {10},
Pages = {20270-20294},
Abstract = {Online instruction through a flipped classroom approach has continued to
   gain popularity in recent years. Engaging learners' attention in
   achieving learning outcomes while embracing the flexibility of online
   learning via flipped classrooms remains an essential topic among
   educators, educational institutions, and society. Studies have found
   that students equipped with self-regulated learning strategies thrive in
   such learning environments. The present study describes and analyses the
   state of research in self-regulated learning strategies and their
   association with the flipped classroom based on the review of articles
   published in Q1 and Q2 journals from 2016 to the middle of 2021. The
   instructions in PRISMA guided the development of systematic review
   protocols. Thirty-two scientific texts from four search databases,
   Science Direct, Scopus, ERIC, and ProQuest, were reviewed. The key
   findings present the effects of self-regulation on academic and
   non-academic outcomes and the factors that influenced the outcomes. The
   findings also revealed six preferred methods to measure self-regulated
   learning in a flipped classroom, specifically through self-report
   questionnaires, as the most preferred approach, followed by learning
   analytics, interviews, think-aloud protocols, reflective documents, and
   observation. Furthermore, the potential future areas of study are
   detailed as prospect references. In conclusion, it is highly recommended
   for educators and future studies to integrate the essential
   characteristics of flipped learning as pointed out by the four pillars
   (F-L-I-P): flexible environment, learning culture, intentional content,
   and professional educator. Ultimately, this justifies the successful
   integration of the flipped classroom into learning and facilitates the
   development of self-regulated learning strategies.},

Abstract = {INTRODUCTION. Pre-service Teacher Training is a basic element to ensure
   a quality educational system. The training programs, in any of their
   stages, must ensure the skills of the teacher in training in both
   theoretical and practical knowledge, and be updated in innovative
   educational methodologies and technology. METHOD. This paper presents an
   experience in which the students of the Master in Secondary Education
   Teacher Training are introduced to the reality of the classroom in which
   they will practice their future profession : master students (those from
   the branch of Mathematics) are transformed into real teachers recording
   the necessary videos to apply Flipped Learning methodology in a real
   High School. RESULTS. The students taking the master not only learned in
   a significant way how to implement an innovative methodology, Flipped
   Classroom, but they also learnt and were trained in educational video
   making. The activity was complemented with the feedback provided by the
   teacher of the High School, thus complementing the experience. To
   analyse the impact of the activity, a survey was conducted on
   themaster's students, and a semi-structured interview was done to a
   sample of them. DISCUSSION. Bringing real practice to Pre-service
   teachers is an essential element for their training as future teachers.
   Results show that Master's students value these types of initiatives
   very positively, and so do Teacher Trainers which conceive this kind of
   activities as necessary to be able to teach how to apply theoretical
   knowledge in practice.},

Abstract = {The purpose of this study was to investigate the high school students'
   views on instructions based on Flipped Classroom Model (FC) and LEGO
   applications. The case study, which is one of the qualitative research
   methods, was used within the scope of the study, the duration of which
   was 7 weeks. In order to choose the research group of the study, one of
   the purposeful sampling methods, criterion sampling, was used. In this
   context, the study was conducted with 35 10th grade high school students
   from two different classes. EGA (ExperimentalGroupA) consisted of 18
   students while EGB (ExperimentalGroupB) consisted of 17 students. Within
   the scope of the study, algorithm instruction with FC and LEGO
   applications was conducted on EGA and LEGO applications and algorithm
   instruction in classroom were conducted on EGB. In accordance with the
   study, processes of focus group discussions and gathering data through
   observation were carried out. For the analysis of the data that was
   gathered, content analysis was performed and NVivo 8 was used. In the
   end of the study, the students were observed to be having great
   prejudices and reported negative views in the beginning of the study.
   Upon the initiation of the study, the prejudices and negative opinions
   were observed to be replaced by positive opinions. Students mentioned a
   great deal of educational benefits of the study. They stated that with
   the study, their motivation and interest in the lesson increased thanks
   to the implementations. Additionally in the group work, students said
   that they cooperated, exchanged ideas, shared tasks, took responsibility
   and socialized with their friends. About FC, students gave positive
   feedback on the communication opportunities of the atmosphere and they
   stated that they could repeatedly go beyond the class hours with FC,
   hence came prepared and saved time. Also students stated that FC
   atmosphere improved opportunities for teacher-student communication.},

Abstract = {Introduction: This program description outlines our approach to
   re-developing our three-part series for graduate students on
   comprehensive searching for knowledge syntheses from in-person to online
   delivery using a flipped classroom model. The re-development coincided
   with our library's response to COVID-19. Description: This series
   followed a flipped classroom model where participants completed
   asynchronous modules built on Articulate Rise 360 before attending a
   synchronous session. Each week of content covered unique learning
   objectives. Pre- and post-class self-assessments were used to examine
   students' understanding of the materials. Outcomes: 152 unique
   participants registered for the series across two offerings in summer
   2020. We observed high engagement with pre-work modules and active
   participation during synchronous sessions. Discussion: We found the
   flipped classroom approach to work well for our users in an online
   environment. Moving forward, we intend to continue with our re-developed
   online workshop series with minor modifications, in addition to
   in-person instruction.},

Abstract = {A great deal of interest has emerged recently in the flipped classroom
   (FC). a student-centered teaching approach. After attending a
   presentation by the first author on the PC. a faculty member of a
   medical school in Mexico arranged for a 3-day workshop for 13 faculty
   members. The goal of the workshop was to train faculty to use the FC
   strategy in their classrooms to increase student engagement in learning.
   The workshop was in the FC style, where the participants would assume
   the role of students. Pre- and posttraining surveys were administered to
   examine participants' current teaching practices and to evaluate their
   perceptions of the FC. The participants overwhelmingly reported the need
   to change their lecture-based teaching. as it was not engaging students.
   Their large class size, lack of technology, training, and uncertainty of
   the effectiveness of new teaching methods had hindered participants from
   changing their teaching technique. The on-site training not only allowed
   the entire department to work closely and discuss the new teaching
   approach, but also reinforced the idea of changing their teaching
   strategy and embracing PC teaching method. After the workshop,
   participants reported being determined to use the FC strategy in their
   classrooms and felt more prepared to do so. The post-survey results
   indicated that participants valued the FC training in the flipped style
   and wanted more of the hands-on activities. In conclusion, the 3-day
   faculty workshop on the PC was successful, since every participant was
   motivated to use this teaching method.},

Abstract = {Competent, efficient, and cost-effective delivery of professional
   development is a challenge in health care. Collaboration of teaching
   methodologies with academia and acute care offers fresh perspectives and
   delivery methods that can facilitate optimal outcomes. One multihospital
   system introduced the academic ``flipped classroom'' model to its acute
   care setting and integrated it into professional development
   requirements. The concept of the flipped classroom requires independent
   student engagement prior to classroom activities versus the traditional
   classroom lecture model. Results realized a cost savings in 2 years of
   \$ 28,737 in addition to positive employee engagement.},

Abstract = {The purpose of this study is to discuss the Design and Development (DDR)
   research approach that was used to develop a Flipped Classroom and
   project-based learning modules for students of Design and Technology
   (D\&T). The module's fundamental theory is based on 21st-century
   teaching and learning models, as well as design thinking. The DDR
   process is divided into three phases: analysis of needs, design and
   development, and evaluation. The phase of needs analysis is used to
   ascertain the necessity of module development and the application of
   design thinking. Three distinct data collection methods were used in
   this phase: semi-structured interviews, survey studies, and document
   analysis. The findings from this phase serve as a backup for the next
   phase. The Isman Instructional Design Model (2011) is adapted for use in
   this phase as a guide for module design and development. Additionally,
   the Fuzzy Delphi Method is used to obtain expert consensus on module
   material design, teaching and learning strategies, software development
   and hardware development requirements, and module prototype evaluation.
   The final phase is implementation and evaluation, which focuses on
   determining the module's effectiveness in the actual teaching and
   learning process. Each finding is organised and documented more
   systematically and orderly in accordance with the DDR phase in order to
   produce more meaningful research results. The conclusion of this article
   proposes a conceptual framework for the research.},

Abstract = {An interdisciplinary approach can improve both functional and aesthetic
   design skills for undergraduate engineering students. In this paper, we
   designed and compared two flipped engineering classrooms, one involving
   only engineering students who worked on individual design tasks, and the
   other including groups of an engineering student and an art major
   student that performed design tasks collaboratively. Fifty-one
   engineering students, 29 from the individual flipped classroom and 22
   from the interdisciplinary flipped classroom participated in the study.
   During the semester, all students studied pre-recorded video lectures
   and homework before the class and then participated in weekly
   engineering design activities either individually or in a group.
   Students' motivational experiences and engineering design achievement
   were assessed at the end of the semester. The results showed that
   students' preferences in employing motivational regulation between the
   two flipped classrooms were different. Also, the students participated
   in the interdisciplinary flipped classroom exhibited higher aesthetic
   design achievement.},

Abstract = {This study explores the viewing patterns of 17 instructional videos in
   both a traditional and flipped classroom environment by 732 business
   students taking an IT-related module. While previous work has
   concentrated mainly on outputs (e.g. student satisfaction/results), this
   study focuses on how the nature of student's interactions with videos
   can be determined through a deep analysis of analytics data. The main
   findings show that there were less interactions with the instructional
   videos in the flipped classroom environment compared to the traditional
   environment, and that videos were used more as a revision aid prior to
   exams (in both environments) than as an ongoing support to develop
   skills during term. Implications of this study include the need for
   regular monitoring of how instructional videos are being used during
   term and the importance of undertaking a deeper analysis of analytics
   data as the initial summary data may be misleading.},

Abstract = {Background: Medical education is evolving to incorporate
   learner-centered strategies which encourage student engagement.
   Educators need to ensure that meaningful education occurs within limited
   interaction time between teachers and trainees. The Flipped Classroom
   (FC) model combines the use of both online and face-to-face interaction.
   Studies describing the process and resource utilization in anesthesia
   residency programs are limited. Methods: After Institutional Review
   Board (IRB) exemption, a qualitative study to assess the feasibility of
   introducing an FC model in the anesthesia residency didactic curriculum
   was conducted. The Post Graduate Year 2 (PGY2) anesthesia resident
   didactic sessions were modified to include one session a month using the
   FC format with the other three sessions presented using traditional
   PowerPoint lecture format at a tertiary academic medical center.
   Post-session surveys were administered to both learners and teachers.
   Survey data were analyzed using Qualtrics (R) software. Survey data
   included perceptions of both learners and teachers regarding quality of
   learning and engagement in the new format. Results: Nineteen residents
   and 10 faculty participated in 10 sessions over the span of 10 months. A
   total of 153 resident responses and 8 faculty responses were submitted
   voluntarily. In our study, a majority of residents indicated they
   preferred the FC format. They also indicated they enjoyed working in
   groups. All the participating faculty felt that student interaction and
   student learning were higher in these sessions. Conclusions: Residency
   programs need to adopt evidence-based solutions to problems arising in
   medical education. We present our experiences in finding a solution to
   make didactic sessions more engaging. Our initial assessment shows that
   it is feasible to introduce the FC model into an existing curriculum in
   an anesthesia residency program and both residents and faculty felt that
   the format enhanced learning and interaction in class.},

Abstract = {A common concern of faculty members is student evaluations of teaching
   scores. Many factors influence student evaluations of teaching including
   how the course is designed. This study investigated student evaluations
   of teaching across three pedagogical techniques: the traditional lecture
   (where lectures were not recorded), recorded lectures, and a flipped
   classroom model. A between-subject design was used over three semesters.
   Student evaluations of teaching showed that students rated the
   instructor significantly higher in a flipped classroom setting. Students
   also reported liking the course more using the flipped pedagogical
   technique. Since the flipped format improved both teaching evaluations
   and student perceptions of the class, this could be useful for
   instructors when they are deciding how to set up the format of their
   class.},

Abstract = {The core problem of Chinese resident doctor training is that medical
   educators present content in an attractive teaching mode to make
   students more motivated to learn and improve their clinical thinking
   ability, humanistic care, and practical ability. The traditional
   classroom mode of teaching cannot meet the needs of modern medical
   education. The purpose of this study is to explore the benefits and
   challenges of the flipped classroom (FC) combined with case- and
   team-based learning (FC-CTBL) for residency training. In this study, 60
   junior surgical residents of Xiangya Medical College were enrolled.
   ``Diabetic foot{''} was selected as the content of this study. Residents
   were divided into an FC-CTBL group and an FC group. FC-CTBL and FC were
   compared on the basis of residents' feedback questionnaires, residents'
   learning burden, test scores from a pre-quiz, and objective structured
   clinical examinations (OSCE). Residents were more satisfied with the
   FC-CTBL model compared with FC. In the FC-CTBL group, more participants
   said that the course improved their teamwork skills, analytical skills
   and their confidence in tackling unfamiliar problems. Residents in the
   FCCTBL group also spent significantly less time preparing for class and
   performed better in the OSCE than those in the FC group. FCCTBL
   stimulates residents' learning motivation, decreases their workload,
   improves their performance in the OSCE and may help to enhance clinical
   thinking and teamwork skills. The FC-CTBL approach is a good option for
   residency training.},

Title = {The use of flipped classroom as an active learning approach improves
   academic performance in social work: A randomized trial in a university},
Journal = {PLOS ONE},
Year = {2019},
Volume = {14},

Abstract = {Background
   The flipped classroom (FC) is a pedagogical approach that means that the
   activities that have traditionally taken place within the classroom are
   carried out outside the classroom. Fundamentally it implies the way in
   which the student studies the subject. This change of perspective in
   teaching-learning has raised many questions regarding its effectiveness
   and student satisfaction in the university studies in the degree of
   Social Work.
   Objective
   The main objective of this study was to evaluate the effectiveness of a
   Flipped Classroom methodology in the academic performance of students of
   the Social Work Degree.
   Methods
   An educational study, with two parallel groups was developed. The
   randomization was carried out by class groups. Group 1 was assigned an
   active teaching methodology of Flip Teaching and it was implemented
   during theoretical teaching hours. The other group of students, Group 2,
   was assigned a traditional lecturer-based learning (LB) methodology. The
   participants were all the students of the morning shift who studied the
   subject Social Work with Groups of the Social Work Degree during the
   academic year 2017-2018. The sample was composed of 110 subjects, with
   60 subjects who developed an active teaching methodology and 50 subjects
   who received a LB.
   Results
   In terms of the academic performance result variable, the FT group had a
   mean of 6.56 (SD: 1.58) and the LB group had a mean of 5.42 (SD: 1.97)
   (p-value: 0.002). The FT group also had a higher percentage of students
   receiving merit and outstanding scores (34.5\% and 6.9\% respectively)
   and a lower percentage of students who failed (19\%) as compared to the
   LB group in which 20.9\% and 2.3\% of the students received merit or
   outstanding grades and 46.5\% failed (p-value = 0.025). No significant
   differences were found with regards to satisfaction with the subject and
   the methodology used, long-term learning and time spent preparing for
   the exam.
   Conclusions
   The FC teaching methodology in comparison with the LB methodology has
   shown to be a more effective tool regarding academic performance
   evaluated in a quantitative and qualitative way with regards to Social
   Work education at university level.},

Title = {Economics student teachers' views on the usefulness of a flipped
   classroom pedagogical approach for an open distance eLearning
   environment},
Journal = {INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF INFORMATION AND LEARNING TECHNOLOGY},
Year = {2018},
Volume = {35},
Number = {4},
Pages = {255-265},
Abstract = {Purpose The purpose of this paper is to explore to what extent a flipped
   classroom pedagogy (FCP) design as a digital pedagogical tool enhances
   student teachers' learning in economics education at an open distance
   e-Learning (ODeL) university.
   Design/methodology/approach This exploratory study used a quantitative
   approach and online survey design. The sample consisted of 214
   Postgraduate Certificate in Education (PGCE) and 157 Baccalaureus
   Educationis (BEd) (senior and further education and training phase)
   student teachers. A closed structured online questionnaire, Flipped
   Classroom Pedagogy Questionnaire, designed on a four-point Likert scale,
   was used to collect data. Descriptive and inferential data were computed
   to explore student teachers' learning to teach an economics education in
   a teacher education course. Ethical clearance was granted and therefore
   adheres to the policy on research ethics of the university.
   Findings Empirically, the findings of this paper revealed that the FCP
   digital pedagogy enhanced economics students' academic performance and
   perceptions in an online open distance learning environment.
   Furthermore, student teachers perceived that the functionality of the
   FCP experience as an online strategy was useful and effective for their
   learning. Therefore, these findings confirmed and extended what is
   revealed by earlier research studies regarding the debate on the
   usefulness of the FCP approach as a powerful technology-integrated
   teaching design in teacher education courses.
   Research limitations/implications The findings of this investigation
   could not be generalised because a small sample was selected. Further
   investigation is needed regarding comparing other similar modules of the
   PGCE/BEd (senior and FET phase) programmes over a longer investigative
   period in the college. Further research should be explored, employing a
   mixed-methods approach on how student teachers perceived academic
   support in the FCP strategy towards self-directed learning.
   Practical implications Ultimately, several implications for using the
   FCP approach emerged, in particular for rethinking teacher education
   programmes to support and accommodate the digital learner. To implement
   this approach successfully, faculties should formulate clear intended
   outcomes for implementing the FCP pedagogical approach. In addition,
   faculties at higher education institutions should seriously consider the
   merits of the FCP approach in order to avoid becoming redundant.
   Therefore, lecturers who intend to use this strategy either through a
   contact, blended or ODeL mode of delivery, are compelled to provide
   consistent, ongoing constructive feedback and monitoring required
   learning tasks.
   Social implications The paper empowers PGCE/BEd (senior and FET phase)
   students to teach the subject in a diverse society.
   Originality/value This research study has shown that student teachers
   perceived an FCP approach in an online platform as an empowering tool
   that is both effective and useful and that positively impacts on their
   lived experience in an ODeL context. It extends the epistemology
   (subject of knowledge) of the effectiveness of the FCP strategy as an
   enhancer for student learning in an ODeL environment, teacher education
   in particular. Furthermore, a noteworthy contribution is made towards
   the application of the FCP as one of the digital pedagogies in teaching
   economics in an ODeL context. This exploratory study also makes a
   methodological contribution to the validation of an online data
   collection instrument for use in future studies.},

Abstract = {One of the challenges in the use of new methodologies and technologies
   during the health crisis caused by the SARS-CoV-2 virus has been to keep
   students motivated in virtual environments. Therefore, the objective of
   this work was to assess the usefulness of audiovisual materials created
   with chroma key in the flipped classroom methodology to teach some
   theoretical concepts in the subject of Developmental Biology in the
   Degree in Biology at the University of Alicante. For this, the teaching
   staff of the subject produced videosusing chroma key technology, which
   were viewed by the students before the online theoretical sessions.
   During the sesessions, the students put into practice the concepts
   discussed in the videos by carrying out activities. The students'
   perception of the methodology used was obtained through an opinion
   questionnaire, in which 90 \% of the respondents stated that the
   combined use of the flipped classroom with chroma key facilitated
   learning by adapting to the rhythm and educational needs of each
   student. They also highlighted that the use of virtual scenery with
   chroma key made online teaching more enjoyable and attractive. In
   conclusion, the chroma key is an effective tool for creating educational
   materials in the flipped classroom that is also attractive and
   motivating for students},

Journal = {CBE-LIFE SCIENCES EDUCATION},
Year = {2019},

Abstract = {In this study, we assessed the impact of providing students with short
   video clips highlighting the relevance of material they are learning in
   the genetics classroom to their everyday lives. These interesting but
   non-learning objective oriented clips, referred to as ``seductive
   details,{''} have been studied extensively in laboratory contexts. In
   laboratory studies, seductive details have been shown to actually
   decrease learning, leading some to recommend that any information not
   directly pertaining to academic learning outcomes be removed from
   education materials. We aimed to uncover effects of seductive details in
   an actual college course, in a manner divorced from the confounding
   variation introduced by instructor-level differences in personality and
   lecture styles. Our results show that, in a flipped-classroom
   environment, seductive details do not harm students' content attainment,
   interest, or perceived learning, but they are memorable. Students with
   high background knowledge of genetics reported greater learning after
   watching videos containing seductive details than students who watched
   equivalent videos without seductive details, but there was no difference
   in quiz scores between the groups. These results contradict some of the
   major effects observed throughout decades of studies conducted in
   artificial psychology laboratory environments and highlight possible
   affective benefits of instructors using seductive details.},

Title = {Flipped Classrooms in Undergraduate Statistics: Online Works Just Fine},
Journal = {TEACHING OF PSYCHOLOGY},
Abstract = {Background The flipped classroom method requires that students engage
   with homework before coming to the classroom so that class time can be
   spent on active and collaborative learning exercises. Research has
   demonstrated that this can improve student performance versus
   traditional lecturer-led teaching methods. Objective: During the
   COVID-19 pandemic, the vast majority of teaching has been entirely
   online such that even `in-class' time has been virtual. The current
   article examined whether online-only delivery affects the efficacy of
   the flipped classroom approach. Method: Grades for a research methods
   and statistics module and a statistics portfolio assignment were
   compared across consecutive cohorts of undergraduate psychology students
   taught by different methods. Results: Overall grades on the module did
   not differ significantly across teaching methods but student performance
   on statistics tests did. Flipped classrooms, whether accompanied by
   on-campus or synchronous online classes, led to significantly better
   performance than traditional methods. No detriment was observed by
   teaching entirely online. Conclusion: The key advantages of the flipped
   classroom method appear driven by active learning which can occur
   irrespective of classroom context. Teaching Implications: Using flipped
   classrooms can be a useful tool, particularly in subjects where students
   may otherwise be less engaged with the content.},

Journal = {BRITISH JOURNAL OF GUIDANCE \& COUNSELLING},
Abstract = {Existing research on the effectiveness of career courses often lacks
   evidence on the comparative effects of different pedagogical formats.
   This study compared the effects of a flipped classroom approach to a
   traditional lecture-based approach for delivering a career course among
   Chinese undergraduate students. A longitudinal quasi-experimental field
   design was used to assess changes in the career outcomes between the
   flipped and non-flipped groups over three time points (pre-, post-, and
   2-month follow-up). Mixed-factorial ANOVAs showed the overall effects
   were stronger immediately post-course and at the 2-month follow-up for
   the flipped approach, although both course designs decreased lack of
   career information and increased environmental exploration. The study
   suggests that the flipped classroom design has the potential to
   outperform traditional teaching approaches.},

Abstract = {In higher education, resistance to shifting educational methods presents
   a challenge in fulfilling the opportunities offered by new methods. The
   purpose of the present study is to document the experiences of a flipped
   classroom intervention in a Norwegian physiotherapy programme, from the
   perspectives of the students and the teachers. The findings demonstrate
   that the students' attitudes were mainly positive. In particular, the
   students evaluated autonomous group work and unlimited access to digital
   material as positive. The academic outcomes from the final exam were
   similar to previous years. Interviews with the teachers showed that the
   learning environment associated with the group work in the flipped
   classroom was a different and highly appreciated experience. In
   conclusion, the present study indicates that there is potential in
   implementing digital approaches in physiotherapy programmes.},

Abstract = {Mathematics is one of the core STEM (science, technology, engineering,
   and mathematics) subject disciplines. Engaging students in learning
   mathematics helps retain students in STEM fields and thus contributes to
   the sustainable development of society. To increase student engagement,
   some mathematics instructors have redesigned their courses using the
   flipped classroom approach. In this review, we examined the results of
   comparative studies published between 2011 and 2020 to summarize the
   effects of this instructional approach (vs. traditional lecturing) on
   students' behavioral, emotional, and cognitive engagement with
   mathematics courses. Thirty-three articles in K-12 and higher education
   contexts were included for analysis. The results suggest that the use of
   the flipped classroom approach may increase some aspects of behavioral
   engagement (e.g., interaction and attention/participation), emotional
   engagement (e.g., course satisfaction), and cognitive engagement (e.g.,
   understanding of mathematics). However, we discovered that several
   aspects (e.g., students' attendance, mathematics anxiety, and
   self-regulation) of student engagement have not been thoroughly explored
   and are worthy of further study. The results of this review have
   important implications for future flipped classroom practice (e.g.,
   engaging students in solving real-world problems), and for research on
   student engagement (e.g., using more objective measures, such as
   classroom observation) in mathematics education.},

Abstract = {Procedural knowledge learning focuses on integrating theory with
   practice; however, time and pace are the main critical issues. In
   response, this study proposes a flipped classroom approach based on the

   theory. Journal of Social and Clinical Psychology, 4(3), 359-373]
   observational learning theory to invert the in-class instructional
   activities and out-of-class practice activities. Two classes with a
   total of 93 college students in a software learning course were chosen
   and compared in this empirical study. The findings suggest that the
   transmission of knowledge achieved via video lectures before class as
   students are able to internalize knowledge and the in-class practice can
   supplement more individual reflective learning time. Moreover, the
   flipped classroom approach is likely to assist and produce students'
   intrinsic motivation. It is also notable that this flipped classroom
   approach may provide benefits to students with hearing disabilities in
   inclusive settings. This paper contributes some evidence for procedural
   knowledge learning including the details of producing the pre-class
   learning videos, a preliminary assessment of the approach, comparing
   feedback and grades from different instructional approaches. These
   experiences may help educators better understand the options available
   to them in converting a procedural knowledge class to the flipped model.},

Abstract = {A challenge with flipped instruction is the pre-class preparation, where
   students independently learn fundamental content outside the classroom.
   For this pre-class learning, instructors typically assign videos with
   quizzes. However, this approach is the same for all and does not address
   differential needs. In a prior National Science Foundation (NSF) study
   with three schools, differences in the outcomes for blended versus
   flipped instruction in a numerical method course were not statistically
   significant, and the effect sizes were small. To diversify pre-class
   preparation and potentially improve outcomes in the flipped classroom,
   the instructor developed lessons using an adaptive platform via a new
   NSF grant. The adaptive platform provides personalized, flexible
   learning with multiple resources, including videos, text, quizzes, and
   simulations, with different paths depending on a student's progress.
   Adaptive lessons were implemented during two semesters in a flipped
   classroom, and the results were compared to (1) flipped instruction
   without adaptive lessons and (2) blended instruction. The comparisons
   consisted of direct assessments (i.e. exams) and student evaluations via
   survey. Analysis was done collectively for students and for several
   demographic groups. Based on direct and indirect measures, the flipped
   classroom with adaptive learning may be the preferred method for this
   and other STEM courses.},

Title = {Flipped classroom improves nursing students' theoretical learning in
   China: A meta-analysis},
Journal = {PLOS ONE},
Year = {2020},
Volume = {15},
Number = {8},
Month = {AUG 27},
Abstract = {Objective At present, current didactic teaching delivery method help
   nursing students apply theory to clinical situations in an inefficient
   way. The flipped classroom (FC), a novel teaching mode emphasizing
   self-study and critical thinking, has generated interest in nursing
   education in China. However, there are a gap in the literature and no
   consistent outcomes of current studies which compared FC and
   lecture-based learning (LBL), and no systematic review has
   comprehensively compared theoretical scores as an affected outcome in FC
   versus LBL modes. Methods In this review, we analyze flipped-learning
   nursing students' scores, and aim to assess the efficacy and provide a
   deeper understanding of the FC in nursing education. Following the
   inclusion criteria, articles were obtained by searching PubMed, Embase
   and Chinese data, including the China National Knowledge Infrastructure,
   Wanfang Data, and VIP database until 3 January 2020. Data were extracted
   from eligible articles and quality was assessed. A meta-analysis was
   then performed using a random effects model with a standardized mean
   value (SMD) and a 95\% confidence interval (CI).32 studies were included
   after reviewing 2,439 citations. All studies were randomized controlled
   trials (RCTs). The FC theoretical knowledge scores in FC were
   significantly positively affected compared to those of the traditional
   classroom (SMD = 1.33, 95\% CI: 1.02-1.64;P< 0.001). In addition, 23
   studies reported skill scores, indicating significant difference between
   the FC mode and LBL mode (SMD = 1.58, 95\%CI: 1.23-1.93;P< 0.001).
   Conclusions The results of this meta-analysis suggest that compared to
   the LBL teaching method, the FC mode dose significantly improve Chinese
   nursing students' theoretical scores. However, the problems of
   heterogeneity and publication bias in this study need to be remedied
   high-quality future studies.},

   activities developed on-line. How, activities developed in presencial
   class too. So, in progressive way carries prosecution and achievement
   specific studies to integral professional formation. In our universities
   the presencial programs using the magister class like predominant

Title = {A Comparison of Flipped and Traditional Classroom Learning: A Case Study
   in Mechanical Engineering},
Journal = {INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF ENGINEERING EDUCATION},
Year = {2018},
Volume = {34},
Number = {6},
Pages = {1876-1887},
Abstract = {The flipped classroom has been introduced to promote collaborative
   learning and higher-order learning objectives. In contrast to the
   traditional classroom, the flipped classroom has students watch
   prerecorded lecture videos before coming to class and then ``class
   becomes the place to work through problems, advance concepts, and engage
   in collaborative learning{''}. In this paper, the active flipped
   learning was applied in engineering mechanics class to combine flipped
   classroom with active learning in order to establish an active flipped
   learning (AFL) model, aiming to promote active learning. Eighty
   sophomores engineering students, most of whom are African-American
   students, participated the active flipped learning. To compare the
   effect of AFL, the traditional teaching was applied in the first half
   semester and pre- and post-tests were used to evaluate their learning
   performance. After the mid-term exams, five flipped models were applied
   to five topics. All of the students attended these flipped models. Pre-
   and post-tests were conducted for the AFL. The survey results were
   analyzed to compare students' learning self-efficacy and satisfaction
   between the traditional and the active flipped classroom. Compared to
   the traditional classroom, students' learning motivation is obviously
   enhanced in the AFL classroom, with students' interest, curiosity and
   learning initiatives in curriculum promoted, intrinsic goal orientation
   further strengthened, in which students tend to have less extrinsic goal
   orientation and lower test anxiety than the students in the traditional
   classroom, but with improved control beliefs and self-efficacy for
   learning. In the traditional classroom, students use more rehearsal and
   elaboration strategies, while in the flipped classroom, students use
   more organization strategies and prefer to use critical thinking
   strategies to raise relative questions about teaching content and video
   materials. Students in the AFL model use more strategies of resource
   management, such as time and study environment, effort regulation, peer
   learning, and help seeking than in the traditional model. In comparison
   of different student groups, the AFL model effectively improves
   students' motivation in both long and short learning time groups, but
   the effects are not obvious on the low GPA students. From the
   perspective of gender, the AFL model helps to increase the male
   students' learning motivation, while female students use more learning
   strategies in task value, control belief and self efficacy in
   traditional model. Therefore, the instructors should pay more attention
   in improving the learning motivation and effectiveness of low GPA group
   and female students in the flipped classroom. In summary, the AFL model,
   by taking advantage of advanced technology, is a convenient and
   professional avenue for engineering students to strengthen their
   academic confidence and self-efficacy in Engineering Mechanics by
   actively participating in learning and fostering their deep
   understanding of engineering statics and dynamics.},

Abstract = {This study investigated the effects of the flipped classroom model on
   EFL learner autonomy in a content-based instructional context. The
   participants involved were students enrolled in two linguistics classes,
   divided into an experimental group (n = 64) which received a flipped
   classroom (FC) instruction and a control group (n = 60) taught in a
   non-flipped classroom. In the FC, various functions were embedded in a
   Moodle course management system (CMS), including video lectures, online
   quizzes, resources and e-journals. The comparison between the pre- and
   post-questionnaire on perceived learner autonomy showed no difference
   between the groups prior to instruction; however, significant
   statistical differences were found between the groups following
   instruction, especially in the constructs of learner autonomous
   strategy, learner behavior and learner confidence. The examination of
   e-journals revealed that learner autonomy had been improved in terms of
   strategy use, behavior, interaction with the materials, the use of
   social resources and self-management of learning. The CMS log analysis
   showed significant correlations between online learning activities and
   perceived learner autonomy. Furthermore, the data collected from the
   pre- and post-questionnaires, e-journal and interviews were analysed and
   interpreted to explain the fostered learner autonomy from psychological,
   technical, sociocultural and political-critical perspectives.},

Abstract = {This paper provides an in-depth analysis and study of the interactive
   flipped classroom model for a digital micro-video for a big data English
   course. To improve the learning efficiency of English courses and reduce
   the learning pressure of students, the thesis also uses certain
   techniques to apply audiovisual language to the production of specific
   micro-class videos, broadcast the successfully recorded micro-class
   courses to students, and then use the questionnaire to randomly
   distribute the designed audiovisual language use questionnaire.
   Micro-classes earnestly perform data statistics for students and finally
   conduct data analysis to summarize and verify the effects of micro-class
   audiovisual language use. The improved algorithm can effectively reduce
   the fluctuation of the consumption of various resources in the cluster
   and make the services in the cluster more stable. The new distributed
   interprocess communication based on protocol and serialization
   technology is more efficient than traditional communication based on
   protocol standards, reduces bandwidth consumption in the cluster, and
   improves the throughput of each node in the cluster. The content design
   and scripting of micro-video teaching resources are based on this. Then,
   the production process of micro-video teaching resources is explained,
   according to the selection of tools, the preparation, recording,
   editing, and generation of materials.},

Abstract = {To maximize learners' performance promotion in flipped classroom, this
   research redesigns a flipped classroom with four integrated practices:
   speed response questions, teacher face-to-face counselling, independent
   practices and team projects. Using questionnaire (N = 66) and interview
   (N = 20) data, the model is tested in two undergraduate introductory
   computer science courses in China, where students are typically reticent
   to engage in active learning in class. Data from a bipolar scale
   revealed that the majority of students regarded the new model as more
   student-centred. Using a learning capability matrix, this research
   deeply explored the benefits by learning dimension. The interviews
   provided details on the students' positive attitudes to the model and
   one area of concern. This research may be helpful for the scholars who
   are redesigning their flipped classrooms or developing new in-class
   activities.},

Title = {A Framework for Teaching Security Design Analysis Using Case Studies and

Abstract = {With ever-greater reliance of the developed world on information and
   communication technologies, constructing secure software has become a
   top priority. To produce secure software, security activities need to be
   integrated throughout the software development lifecycle. One such
   activity is security design analysis (SDA), which identifies security
   requirements as early as the software design phase. While considered an
   important step in software development, the general opinion of
   information security subject matter experts and researchers is that SDA
   is challenging to learn and teach. Experimental evidence provided in
   literature confirms this claim.
   To help solve this, we have developed a framework for teaching SDA by
   utilizing case study analysis and the hybrid flipped classroom approach.
   We evaluate our framework by performing a comparative analysis between a
   group of students who attended labs generated using our framework and a
   group that participated in traditional labs. Our results show that labs
   created using our framework achieve better learning outcomes for SDA, as
   opposed to the traditional labs. Secondary contributions of our article
   include teaching materials, such as lab descriptions and a case study of
   a hospital information system to be used for SDA.
   We outline instructions for using our framework in different contexts,
   including university courses and corporate training programs. By using
   our proposed teaching framework, with our or any other case study, we
   believe that both students and employees can learn the craft of SDA more
   effectively.},

Abstract = {FLIPPED CLASSROOM IN TEACHING ORGANIC CHEMISTRY: A CASE STUDY. The
   flipped classroom is one of the types of rotation model strategies that
   aim of increasing interaction and personalized contact time between
   students and teachers in the classroom setting. In this study, we
   investigated the application of the flipped classroom strategy in two
   classes of the different semesters in the discipline of Organic
   Chemistry. The teacher applied this strategy in different ways in order
   to verify how the flipped classroom can contribute to the teaching and
   learning process in the content of Nuclear Magnetic Resonance (NMR). The
   research, of qualitative nature, is a case study being carried out in
   six steps with the participation of twenty-five students and one
   teacher. The instruments used for data collection were an investigative
   questionnaire (applied to students) and a structured interview (carried
   out with the teacher). The results show that the students had control
   over their learning, presenting a favorable position for the application
   of the strategy. In addition, the teacher reported that it was possible
   to deepen the content of NMR with his students, teaching the class in a
   different way than he was used to, focusing on doubts (individual and
   collective), as well as comments regarding the materials produced by
   him.

Abstract = {The flipped classroom pedagogy has been widely used recently. Despite
   many researches have paid attention with the learning outcome of flipped
   classroom, there has been limited attention in regard to investigate the
   relationship between learning behavior and learning outcomes in a
   flipped classroom. In this paper, we proposed to investigate the
   influence of online learning behaviors on short-term and long-term
   learning outcomes in a flipped classroom. This study used Calculus and
   grade point average (GPA) scores to represent short-term and long-term
   learning outcomes, respectively. Multiple linear regression indicated
   that students' online learning behavior does not have a significant
   effect on short-term learning outcomes, but has a significant effect on
   long-term learning outcomes. For applying multiple correspondence
   analysis, students were divided into groups according to five grade
   levels based on their scores. According to GPA grade level, students'
   online learning behaviors had a significant effect on long-term learning
   outcomes for the five groups (GPAa, GPAb, GPAc, GPAd, GPAe). According
   to their Calculus grade level, students' online learning behaviors had a
   significant effect on short-term learning outcomes for three groups
   (CALa, CALd, and CALe), but two groups (CALb and CALc) did not
   demonstrate this trend. For exploring the effects of online learning
   behaviors on future learning outcomes, GPA can be considered
   representative because the GPA was calculated for the entire academic
   year 2015. Students in the CALa group exhibited the highest frequency of
   online learning behaviors and obtained the highest GPA grade levels
   (GPAa and GPAb). For the CALb, CALc, CALd, and CALe groups, students
   with a higher frequency of online learning behaviors obtained a higher
   GPA grade level. These results indicate that students' online learning
   behaviors have a positive effect on future learning outcomes.},

Title = {Undergraduate nursing students ` experience of learning respiratory
   system assessment using flipped classroom: A mixed methods study},
Journal = {NURSE EDUCATION TODAY},
Year = {2021},
Volume = {98},
Month = {MAR},
Abstract = {Background: Knowledge and skill acquisition to perform an accurate
   respiratory system assessment is a key competency expected in
   undergraduate nursing students. Learning physical assessment requires
   the integration of multiple knowledge bases and skills; hence, applying
   an innovative teaching approach, such as the flipped classroom (FC)
   approach, fosters an active and student-centered learning environment
   for physical assessment class. Objectives: This study evaluated FC's
   feasibility in delivering respiratory system assessment content in a
   health assessment course and explored the changes in nursing students'
   perceptions regarding student-centeredness and active learning
   environments before and after applying FC. Design: A single group preand
   post-test concurrent mixed-methods design was used. Settings: This study
   was conducted in a private nursing college in South Korea. Participants:
   A convenience sample of 91 second year undergraduate nursing students
   enrolled in a health assessment course. Methods: FC was offered at one
   didactic session of a physical assessment course. In the FC, students
   completed a self-directed pre-class activities using online lecture
   videos and reading materials prior to the class and participated in
   interactive team-based learning activities inside the classroom. Skills
   lab practicum took place after the FC. Students' perceptions regarding
   student-centeredness and active learning environments, in terms of
   teaching, social, and cognitive presences were measured before (T1) and
   after (T2) conducting the FC. Qualitative data were obtained at T2 using
   free-response questions, which required students to comment on their FC
   experience. Results: Participants' perceptions of student-centeredness
   significantly increased from T1 to T2. Although student-perceived
   teaching and social presence in their learning environment showed upward
   trends from T1 to T2, these changes were not statistically significant.
   Students considered FC an acceptable approach to foster active learning
   in a supportive learning environment. Conclusions: This study revealed
   that incorporating FC to deliver respiratory system assessment content
   was feasible and considered acceptable by undergraduate nursing
   students.},

Abstract = {A video production activity utilizing a flipped-classroom approach was
   used in a public health nursing course to educate undergraduate nursing
   students about infectious diseases. After reviewing an audio-recorded
   lecture at home, students were divided into small groups to create short
   video clips on selected infectious diseases. Four themes emerged from
   the subsequent participant survey: engagement, in-depth understanding
   but concerns for new knowledge acquisition, practical, and room for
   improvement. The flipped classroom approach with video production
   encouraged students to engage in their public health nursing class and
   provided them with an opportunity to practice important communication

Abstract = {The study in this paper reports on whether an online homework system in
   combination with a flipped classroom has a positive effect on success
   rates of first year statistics students. Departing from a traditional
   teaching model (Baseline), the technology-based intervention strategies
   implemented were firstly the Aplia interactive online homework system
   (Phase 1) and then, in addition, the flipped classroom (Phase 2). In the
   flipped classroom model, the transfer of information took place by
   pre-reading and pre-class Aplia homework assignments. This approach
   intended to allow more quality time to be spent on revisiting difficult
   concepts and engaging in problems inside the lecture hall, thus
   enhancing the learning process. The average final marks of the three
   cohorts were compared using an ANOVA test. Chi-square tests were used to
   evaluate the effects of the changing teaching models from Baseline
   through Phase 1 to Phase 2. The success rates of three different cohorts
   (n = 1485, 1343 and 1466 respectively), consisting of only first-time
   statistics students with a Grade 12 mathematics mark of at least 60\%,
   were assessed. For Phase 1 compared with the Baseline the increase in
   the success rate was insignificant, but the success rates for Phase 2
   compared with both Phase 1 and Baseline improved significantly with a
   small to medium effect size, because of the very large samples. The
   practical importance of this is that the number of successful students
   increased by more than 100 from Phase 1 to Phase 2 and more than 130
   from Baseline to Phase 2. A significant relationship was also found
   between the different cohorts and their mark distributions, confirming
   that the online homework system in combination with the flipped
   classroom in particular is effective in increasing the success rate.},

Abstract = {Recently, flipped classrooms have received increasing research interest
   in various disciplines (Gaughan, 2014). Although researchers have
   identified major psychological factors affecting the quality of the
   flipped classroom, these factors have not been systematically or
   simultaneously examined. Drawing on the questionnaire data obtained from
   39 university second-language learners of different achievement
   profiles, this study explores the relative effects of students' accepted
   workload, preferred form of work (group vs. individual) and perceived
   usefulness of flipped classrooms on these learners' perceptions and
   acceptance of a flipped classroom. Additionally, based on these
   university L2 learners' questionnaire responses, we examined if
   achievement levels (high vs. low achievers) would modulate the effects
   of the aforementioned factors. The results showed that high achievers
   could accept 2 hours of preparatory work prior to class, but that low
   achievers could only accept 1 hour of work. Additionally, while high
   achievers prefer individual work, low achievers like to work in groups.
   Based on the findings of the study, pedagogical implications for the
   implementation of the flipped classroom for mixed-level students are
   discussed.},

Title = {Replacing Lectures with Small Groups: The Impact of Flipping the
   Residency Conference Day},

Abstract = {The flipped classroom, an educational alternative to the traditional
   lecture, has been widely adopted by educators at all levels of education
   and across many disciplines. In the flipped classroom, learners prepare
   in advance of the face-to-face meeting by learning content material on
   their own. Classroom time is reserved for application of the learned
   content to solving problems or discussing cases. Over the past year, we
   replaced most residency program lectures with small-group discussions
   using the flipped-classroom model, case-based leaming, simulation and
   procedure labs. In the new model, residents prepared for conference by
   reviewing a patient case and studying suggested learning materials.
   Conference day was set aside for facilitated small-group discussions
   about the case.This is a cross-cohort study of emergency medicine
   residents who experienced the lecture-based curriculum to residents in
   the new flipped-classroom curriculum using paired comparisons
   (independent t-tests) on in-training exam scores while controlling for
   program year level. We also compared results of the evaluation of
   various program components. We observed no differences between cohorts
   on in-training examination scores. Small-group methods were rated the
   same across program years. Two program components in the new curriculum,
   an updated format of both adult and pediatric case conferences, were
   rated significantly higher on program quality. In preparation for
   didactics, residents in the new curriculum report spending more time on
   average with outside learning materials, including almost twice as much
   time reviewing textbooks. Residents found the new format of the case
   conferences to be of higher quality because of the inclusion of
   rapid-fire case discussions with targeted learning points.},

Abstract = {This study aims to find out how students prepared for a flipped
   classroom and to examine what type of instruction could effectively
   guide students to do pre-class preparation. We conducted case studies
   for over two years in a physiology class at a Japanese university. In a
   survey performed in 2017, students were asked to participate in a
   questionnaire and an interview. Their responses in the questionnaire
   indicated that there was a clear and positive correlation between their
   class preparation time and individual grades, while class preparation of
   some students was proven not so productive or efficient. By the same
   token, the student interview made clear that students were not well
   informed of what to focus on or how to prepare appropriately for the
   flipped classes. Based on the 2017 findings, we started to share
   learning objectives with students for their pre-class preparation in the
   2018 course. Amid and after the 2018 spring semester, questionnaires
   were administered to examine the effectiveness of instructions for
   preparation, and of sharing learning objectives to measure the level of
   students' metacognition. As a result, the students who continuously
   review the learning objectives achieved significantly higher grades than
   the students who did not. We also found that the level of students'
   metacognition exerted a stronger influence on their grades than the
   amount of effort invested in reviewing the learning objectives for
   pre-class preparation. In conclusion, our study suggests that
   instructors should design a comprehensive flipped class model which
   maximizes the benefit of pre-class preparation time by envisioning that
   students' preparation would be more sustainable and effective with
   proper guidance.},

Abstract = {This project investigated how Wikipedia can be integrated into flipped
   learning in higher education through the project-based learning
   approach. It proposed a flipped learning model where Wikipedia was
   involved in creating a collaborative learning environment. Two groups of
   students participated in the research and were asked to complete group
   projects of creating Wikipedia entries, one of which learned in the
   flipped classroom, the other in the conventional classroom. An online
   collaborative learning platform, GMoodle, was developed to provide an
   interactive learning environment for the participants' learning with
   Wikipedia. The results showed that learning with Wikipedia in the
   flipped classroom was more effective than learning with Wikipedia in the
   conventional classroom. The participants in the flipped group created
   more versions of Wikipedia entries. The flipped learning environment
   provided the students with more in-class collaboration and interaction
   opportunities, leading to more time and space for active learning.},

Title = {Flipped classroom: Emancipation of masters and learned in the light of
   the ideas of Freire and Ranciere},
Journal = {EDUCACAO},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {47},
Pages = {1-24},
Abstract = {The authors Jacques Ranciere and Paulo Freire in their works asserted
   the importance of education as a practice of freedom, without hierarchy,
   that leads students towards an intellectual emancipation. Our reflection
   is about the presence of these ideals in the adoption of the Inverted
   Classroom methodology to answer how the use of this strategy
   contemplates the precepts of these thinkers, in the perspective of
   emancipation, the equality of the intelligences of students and
   teachers. The general objective of the study is to reflect critically on
   how the Inverted Classroom contributes to the emancipation of students
   and teachers in the light of the ideas of Freire and Ranciere, as well
   as to identify the pillars that support the methodology of inversion of
   learning and to extrapolate the conception tradition of being a teacher
   as a mere explainer. It is inferred that the object chosen for study may
   support the adoption of this new methodology, contributing to
   pedagogical practices that contribute to the construction of an
   emancipatory, egalitarian education, based on ethical values and solid
   foundations that allow the individual not only to be in the world, but
   be an integral part of it, problematizing, recognizing and intervening.
   The research has a qualitative approach and bibliographic procedure,
   composing a fabric of reflections and considerations to confirm or not
   the initial hypothesis. Its relevance centers on the possibility of
   identifying in the Inverted Classroom, in addition to a strategy for the
   use of technology in favor of learning, also a potential for the
   emancipatory exercise of teachers and students, in the practice of
   equality of intelligences. In this vein, the power of dialogue, the
   relevance of doubt and curiosity as bridges to knowledge will be
   highlighted, pointing out that Freire and Ranciere's convictions are
   possible to materialize and are present in the development of this very
   contemporary strategy. Keywords: Flipped Classroom. Paulo Freire.

Title = {Predictive power of regularity of pre-class activities in a flipped
   classroom},
Journal = {COMPUTERS \& EDUCATION},
Year = {2019},
Volume = {134},
Pages = {156-168},
Month = {JUN},
Abstract = {Flipped classroom (FC) is an active learning design requiring students
   to complete assigned pre-class learning activities in preparation for
   face-to-face sessions. Students' timely, regular, and productive
   engagement with the pre-class activities is considered critical for the
   success of the overall FC design, as these activities serve to prepare
   students for effective participation in face-to-face sessions. However,
   there is limited empirical evidence on the strength of association
   between students' regularity of engagement with the pre-class activities
   and their learning performance in a FC course. Hence, the current study
   uses learning trace data from three consecutive offerings of a FC course
   to examine students' regularity of pre-class learning activities and its
   association with the students' course performance. In particular, the
   study derives several indicators of regularity from the trace data,
   including indicators related to time management and those reflecting
   regularity in the pattern of engagement with pre-class learning
   activities. The association with course performance is examined by
   building predictive regression models with the defined indicators as
   features. To examine the relevance of incorporating the specificities of
   the instructional design in predictive models, we designed and compared
   two kinds of indicators: generic (i.e. course-design-agnostic) and
   course-design-specific indicators. The study identified several
   indicators of regularity of pre-class activities as significant
   predictors of course performance. It also demonstrated that predictive
   models with only generic indicators were able to explain only a small
   portion of the overall variability in the students' course performance,
   and were significantly outperformed by models that incorporated
   coursespecific indicators. Finally, the study findings point to the
   importance of assisting students in regulating their use of learning
   resources during class preparation activities in a FC.},

Abstract = {The popularity of flipped classroom (FC) is growing in medical
   education. However, the application of FC in pathology teaching has not
   been well explored. This study assessed the efficacy of FC combined with
   case-based learning (CBL) in undergraduate pathology education via
   comparison with a traditional lecture-based classroom (LBC). A total of
   117 third-year students were enrolled and assigned to the FC group (n =
   59) or LBC group (n = 58) with demographic matches. Two sections in the
   pathology textbook (cardiovascular and respiratory system diseases) were
   chosen for the teaching content. Students in the FC group were required
   to study the preprovided course materials pre-class, followed by
   clinical case-based interactive group discussion in-class. Students in
   the LBC group were encouraged to preview and attended a didactic lecture
   in class. Post-class quizzes and Likert questionnaires were performed to
   investigate the efficacy and possible advantages of CBL-based FC over
   LBC. The scores of the 2 groups in the mid-term examination of pathology
   before interventions were comparable. However, students in the FC group
   gained significantly higher scores in the post-quizzes than those in the
   LBC group, especially the scores regarding the questions of clinical
   case analysis. In the questionnaires, more students considered CBL-based
   FC to be beneficial to learning motivation, knowledge comprehension,
   critical thinking, patient management and teamwork than LBC. In
   addition, more students agreed that the FC model increased pre-class
   burden than LBC, rather than in-class pressure. CBL-based FC modality
   has promising effects on undergraduate pathology education and may be a
   better choice than traditional LBC. Further optimizations are needed to
   implement this novel approach in pathology and other medicine curricula.},

Title = {Students' learning performance and perceived motivation in gamified
   flipped-class instruction},
Journal = {COMPUTERS \& EDUCATION},

Abstract = {This is a pilot study aimed at examining students' learning performance
   and perceived motivation between a gamified flipped classroom and a
   non-gamified flipped classroom instructional model, based on the
   Self-Determination Theory (SDT). This study employed a mixed-method
   research approach, using three formative assessments or a post-test only
   design to examine students' learning achievement. Questionnaires and
   personal interviews were employed to support the data collection process
   in terms of students' perceived motivation. Fifty-six students were the
   respondents involved in a non-randomized experiment with a control group
   design. The results reveal that assessment 1 showed no significant
   difference between the two groups of the gamified flipped and
   non-gamified flipped classroom instruction (t = 1.68, p.474), while
   assessment 2 and 3 were significantly different (t = 5.54, p = .007 <
   .05) and (t = 10.17, p = .001 < .05). In the present study, the findings
   confirm that the students were positive regarding perceived competence,
   autonomy, and relatedness, better performance, and were able to achieve
   good achievement during the tests. The survey results reveal that the
   gamified flip-class setting fostered better motivation and engagement.
   Particularly, students motivated to compete and beat other students
   during the gamification activities by collecting points and badges as
   many as possible. Four main themes emerged from the qualitative
   interviews, namely, (1) pre-class learning motivation, (2) pre-class
   competition, (3) students' learning autonomy, and (4) students' social
   engagement. Conclusions from this study showed that the gamified
   flip-class setting had successfully constructed the basic psychological
   needs of SDT, namely: competency, autonomy, and relatedness.},

Title = {FLIPPED UNIVERSITY CLASS: A STUDY OF MOTIVATION AND LEARNING},
Journal = {JOURNAL OF INFORMATION TECHNOLOGY EDUCATION-RESEARCH},
Year = {2020},
Volume = {19},
Pages = {41-63},
Abstract = {Aim/Purpose This study aims to explore the relationship between
   motivation and students' perspectives, learning performance, and use of
   online course materials in flipped classrooms.
   Background The flipped classroom model is an innovative instruction
   method that has limited research to date exploring its impact on
   motivation. It remains unknown if the same motivation patterns exist in
   flipped classrooms as in purely face-to-face or online learning
   environments.
   Methodology Fifty-nine undergraduate students' expectancy beliefs
   (control beliefs about learning, self-efficacy) and value beliefs (task
   value, intrinsic motivation, extrinsic motivation) were measured by
   subscales adapted from Motivated Strategies for Learning Questionnaire.
   Students' final grade percentage represented their learning performance.
   Regression analysis was used to explore the ability of motivational
   characteristics to evaluate how well the five motivational subscales
   predicted participants' perspectives of a flipped class.
   Contribution The results of this study suggest that students have
   similar motivation patterns regarding their learning performance in
   flipped classrooms as in traditional or online classrooms. Overall,
   students reported positive motivational beliefs towards a flipped
   classroom.
   Findings Results indicated that students in a flipped classroom also
   show a positive correlation with motivation regarding their learning
   performance as in traditional or online classrooms. Self-efficacy is a
   significant predictor of both students' academic achievement and
   perceptions of the flipped classroom. Overall, students had positive
   attitudes towards the flipped model but indicated neutral attitudes when
   asked if they wished to take another class taught in a flipped format.
   Recommendations for Practitioners The findings suggested that
   instructors should set up pre-class activities related to credits that
   account for the course grade to reinforce students' effort spent on
   course preparation. The results of this study suggest that students'
   previous experiences of flipped classrooms and online learning may not
   always affect their motivational beliefs, learning performance, and
   perceptions of the course format in a flipped classroom. However, a
   large number of online materials may cause fatigue and make students
   unwilling to use all the online materials.
   Recommendations for Researchers The flipped classroom model is a
   valuable teaching strategy that can be applied at any educational level
   to maximize learning time, but continuing research is needed in the
   field to improve the effectiveness of this approach and facilitate
   learning among all students, including those with low self-efficacy
   beliefs or overall motivation.
   Impact on Society While the flipped learning model challenges
   instructors to shift emphasis from providing content to designing active
   learning experiences, this role remains vitally important for
   facilitating in-class activities, scaffolding out-of-class preparation,
   and effectively implementing the flipped design.
   Future Research This research did not use control experiments to
   eliminate other confounding variables. This study explored relationships
   between motivation and flipped learning but did not prove cause and
   effect. Whether students in a non-flipped learning classroom have a
   higher or lower motivation is still unknown and more empirical studies
   are still needed in the field for assisting instructors who want to
   adopt this teaching style with better practices.},

Abstract = {Flipped classroom teaching model comes from the USA, widely popular in
   recent years and has become one of the world's most popular teaching
   models. Before class, students learn knowledge by watching multimedia
   courseware, accessing information and communicating with teachers and
   classmates online. In the classroom, teachers put the majority of class
   time for exchanges and discussions with students, interpretation,
   homework guidance, organisation and participation in group activities
   and so on. The paper introduces how to use the concept of the flipped
   classroom teaching in mechanics of materials course, promoting the
   teaching quality. Course website is full of course information. Through
   the website, students can study the mechanics of materials course
   knowledge system. With the website background management, teachers
   update the website information in a timely manner Course website is rich
   in function modules. Each function module includes rich teaching
   contents, provides a large amount of course information.},

Abstract = {The aim of this study is to examine the factors that influenced the use
   of Edmodo content management system to support the teaching and learning
   in a flipped classroom context. Using an extended technology acceptance
   model (TAM), we adopted a revised model consisting of two external
   factors (Content Quality and Motivation) that may influence students'
   perceptions and acceptance of the system. A total of 42 students were
   involved in this study. The students attended a course in a flipped
   classroom environment. The findings of the study utilizing the multiple
   regression analysis revealed that the Edmodo content management system
   was well accepted where the Content Quality acted as a good external
   factor and able to predict the students Perception of Usefulness and
   Perception Ease of Use. As for Motivation, it was found that there was
   no positive relationship with the Perception of Usefulness.},

Journal = {INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF SYSTEM ASSURANCE ENGINEERING AND MANAGEMENT},
Abstract = {An effective teaching modality not only improves the efficiency of the
   teaching process but also promotes active learning. Teaching modalities
   are continuously evolving due to advancement in technology. There is a
   range of contradictory reports available in the extant literature
   regarding the effectiveness of different teaching modalities. This work
   assesses and prioritises four teaching modalities namely face-to-face
   teaching, pure online teaching, blended teaching and flipped classroom
   teaching. Assessment is made based on 8 criteria identified from the
   literature in consultation with the experts. Analysis revealed that the
   flipped classroom and blended teaching approaches are the most effective
   teaching modalities. Examination of the literature indicates that to
   date no study evaluated all the four aforementioned teaching modalities
   in a single study. The study is the first attempt to assesses 4 teaching
   modalities based on 8 eight common criteria by extending TOPSIS to a
   single-valued neutrosophic environment. Current work provides valuable
   insights to various stakeholders including academicians, policymakers
   and practitioners, who are interested in giving a rich learning
   experience to learners.},

Title = {Academic outcomes of flipped classroom learning: a meta-analysis},
Journal = {MEDICAL EDUCATION},
Year = {2018},
Volume = {52},

Month = {SEP},
Abstract = {ContextThe flipped classroom (FC), reversing lecture and homework
   elements of a course, is popular in medical education. The FC uses
   technology-enhanced pre-class learning to transmit knowledge,
   incorporating in-class interaction to enhance higher cognitive learning.
   However, the FC model is expensive and research on its effectiveness
   remains inconclusive. The aim of this study was to compare the efficacy
   of the FC model over traditional lecture-based (LB) learning by
   meta-analysis.
   MethodsWe systematically searched MEDLINE, PubMed, ERIC, CINAHL, EMBASE,
   reference lists and Association for Medical Education in Europe (AMEE)
   conference books. Controlled trials comparing academic outcomes between
   the FC and LB approaches in higher education were considered eligible.
   The main findings were pooled using a random-effects model when
   appropriate.
   ResultsForty-six studies (9026 participants) were included, comprising
   four randomised controlled trials (RCTs), 19 quasi-experimental studies
   and 23 cohort studies. Study populations were health science (n = 32)
   and non health science (n = 14) students. The risk of bias was high
   (36/37 articles). Meta-analyses revealed that the FC had significantly
   better outcomes than the LB method in examination scores
   (post-intervention and pre-post change) and course grades, but not in
   objective structured clinical examination scores. Subgroup analyses
   showed the advantage of the FC was not observed in RCTs, non-USA
   countries, nursing and other health science disciplines and earlier
   publication years (2013 and 2014). Cumulative analysis and
   meta-regression suggested a tendency for progressively better outcomes
   by year. Outcome assessments rarely focused on behaviour change.
   ConclusionsThe FC method is associated with greater academic achievement
   than the LB approach for higher-level learning outcomes, which has
   become more obvious in recent years. However, results should be
   interpreted with caution because of the high methodological diversity,
   statistical heterogeneity and risk of bias in the studies used. Future
   studies should have high methodological rigour, a standardised FC format
   and utilise assessment tools evaluating higher cognitive learning and
   behaviour change to further examine differences between FC and LB
   learning.
   The authors' meta-analysis (46 studies, >9000 participants, health and
   non-health science education) found flipped classrooms generally have
   significantly better learning outcomes than lecture learning, with a
   tendency for better outcomes for more recent studies.},

Title = {Effectiveness of flipped classroom model in teaching histology for
   first-year MBBS students based on competency-based blended learning: An
   interventional study},
Journal = {JOURNAL OF EDUCATION AND HEALTH PROMOTION},

Abstract = {BACKGROUND: With recent changes in the curriculum of bachelor of
   medicine and bachelor of surgery (MBBS) course to meet the global trends
   and to fulfill the standards expected from an Indian medical graduate,
   introduction of newer teaching methodologies becomes mandatory. The
   usage of flipped classroom (FCR) in medical education has always been
   rewarding. This study was to evaluate the effectiveness of FCR as a
   teaching method in comparison with traditional lectures in histology
   sessions in Sri Ramaswamy Memorial (SRM) Medical College Hospital and
   Research Centre, Chennai, Tamil Nadu, India. MATERIALS AND METHODS: This
   interventional study was conducted among the 1st year MBBS students in
   SRM Medical College Hospital and Research Centre for a period of 1 year
   (2018-2019 academic year). The histology sessions were taught using both
   traditional lectures and FCR methodology. Pre- and posttests were
   conducted for each traditional and FCR session with ten multiple-choice
   questions pertaining to that topic. Students' performance was assessed
   by paired t-test (for pre- and posttest comparisons) and independent
   t-test (for traditional and FCR posttest mark comparison) using SPSS
   software version 26. A feedback survey based on Likert scale was also
   conducted on the students and was analyzed. P < 0.05 was considered
   statistically significant. RESULTS: Posttest marks had statistically
   significantly improved when compared to pretest marks (P < 0.0001) in
   both traditional and FCR teaching methods. Comparison of posttest marks
   showed statistically significantly higher marks in FCR when compared to
   traditional teaching (P < 0.0001). Similarly, students' feedback survey
   showed that FCR benefitted the students in achieving the competency
   required. CONCLUSION: FCR methodology of teaching histology had a very
   impressive outcome and the students' perception was very positive.},

Title = {Comparing the Results of Written Testing for Advanced Cardiac Life
   Support Teaching Using Team-based Learning and the ``Flipped
   Classroom{''} Strategy},
Journal = {CUREUS},

Abstract = {Objectives
   We sought to further determine whether cognitive test results changed
   for advanced cardiac life support (ACLS) taught in the team-based
   learning/flipped classroom format (TBL/FC) versus a lecture-based (LB)
   control.
   Methods
   We delivered 2010 ACLS to two classes of fourth-year medical students in
   the TBL/FC format (2015-2016), compared to three classes in the LB
   format (2012-2014). There were 27.5 hours of instruction for the TBL/FC
   model (TBL - 10.5 hours, podcasts - nine hours, small-group simulation -
   eight hours), and 20 hours (lectures - 12 hours, simulation - eight
   hours) in LB. We taught TBL for 13 cardiac cases while LB had none.
   Didactic content and seven simulated cases were the same in lecture
   (2012-2014) or in podcast formats (2015-2016). Testing was the same
   using 50 multiple-choice (MC) format questions, 20 rhythm-matching
   questions, and seven fillin management of simulated cases.
   Results
   Some 468 students enrolled in the course 259 (55.4\%) in the LB format
   in 2012-2014, and 209 (44.6\%) in the TBL/FC format in 2015-2016. The
   scores for two out of three tests (MC and fillin) increased with TBL/FC.
   Combined, median scores increased from 93.5\% (IQR 90.6, 95.4) to 95.1\%
   (92.5, 96.8, p = 0.0001). More students did not pass one of three tests
   with LB versus TBL/FC (24.7\% versus 18.2\%), and two or three parts of
   the test (8.1\% versus 4.3\%, p = 0.01). On the contrary, 77.5\% passed
   all three with TBL/FC versus 67.2\% with LB (change 10.3\%, 95\% CI
   2.2\%-18.2\%).
   Conclusion
   TBL/FC teaching for ACLS improved written test results compared with the
   LB format.},

Title = {Design, implementation, and evaluation of an inverted (flipped)
   classroom model economics for sustainable education course},
Journal = {JOURNAL OF CLEANER PRODUCTION},

Abstract = {How effective is the Inverted Classroom Model (ICM), a teaching tool
   most often used with undergraduates, when applied to postgraduate
   learners in economics and sustainability? ICM, also known as the
   ``flipped classroom{''}, replaces the classroom lecture with active
   student involvement in experiential teaming activities in class, whilst
   the core course content is provided using digital tools and video
   lectures, possibly in addition to readings, before the students arrive
   at class. In 2016, the Vienna University of Economics and Business
   brought ICM to its postgraduate economics students for the first time.
   The authors of this paper used ICM to teach behavioural economics, a
   core course in the Masters in Socio-Ecological Economics and Policy with
   49 students, as a pilot for using ICM in a sustainability education
   context. Case study methodology was applied to document the ICM pilot
   and discusses the effectiveness of the ICM approach. Did the student's
   view the ICM format positively? Did the ICM format meet the instructors'
   goals for sustainable education? Which In-class Activities did the
   students benefit from or criticise? This case study used an anonymous
   post-course perception survey to determine if the pilot was successful
   from the students' point of view, grades, and the authors' observations.
   The main findings are that ICM ``worked{''} for sustainable education.
   Students acquired new knowledge, valued elements of the course that were
   intended for reflection, and expanded their competencies. The majority
   of students were satisfied with the ICM format and believed that it
   improved their individual performance. However, students advised against
   expanding this format. The authors interpret this paradoxical result as
   reflecting the students' perception that the inverted classroom and
   active learning methods implemented in this course imposed a too high
   workload; whereas the students perceive that they receive sufficient
   benefits from a traditional lecture format. While it is a case study,
   the findings and outcomes apply to postgraduate education in economics,
   particularly in sustainable education programs. Therefore, this research
   contributes to the field of research on ICM at the post-graduate level
   and augments the limited research on ICM in sustainable education.
   Additionally, this paper expands the research on ICM in the
   German-speaking world. (C) 2018 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.},

Abstract = {This paper outlines the subjective and quantitative outcomes of the
   introduction of the flipped classroom approach to two engineering
   subjects at the University of Melbourne. In this approach, lectures are
   delivered online as opposed to the traditional method of being provided
   in person. To facilitate learning, after each part of an online lecture,
   students completed an activity to reflect upon and review the content
   via compulsory questionnaires. Students would then attend formal classes
   in person (e.g., workshops) in which they would participate in
   interactive and collaborative activities related to the online lecture
   material. Surveys were provided to the students at the beginning of the
   semester to understand their perceptions of different learning
   activities. The surveys indicate that students who did well on the
   questionnaires also did well in the subject with a positive trend
   between questionnaire scores and final grades in both subjects. The
   survey results suggest that the flipped classroom method could provide
   students with better learning outcomes for subjects at the university
   level if implemented in a way that promotes active and student-centered
   learning. Some recommendations are provided based on the results of this
   paper for the implementation of the flipped classroom method for future
   subjects at the university level.},

Title = {Student Learning in an Accelerated Introductory Biology Course Is
   Significantly Enhanced by a Flipped-Learning Environment},
Journal = {CBE-LIFE SCIENCES EDUCATION},
Year = {2018},
Volume = {17},
Number = {3},
Month = {SEP 1},
Abstract = {A flipped-classroom environment generally strives to create more
   in-class time for activities that enhance student learning, while
   shifting some content delivery to outside the classroom through the use
   of short didactic videos. We compared a flipped-classroom setting with
   the traditional ({''}control{''}) setting for an accelerated
   lower-division general biology course. Student self-reporting and video
   analytics functions showed ample and variable video viewing among
   individual students. Student learning was evaluated through quizzes
   administered after a set of concepts were covered (post 1) and at the
   end of the course (post 2). Students in the flipped sections had
   significantly higher quiz scores than students in the control sections
   for both post 1 and post 2. Analyses of variance analyzing the effect of
   and interactions between type of instruction, in-class activities, time,
   and Bloom's level of the quiz questions found significant differences in
   the overall model and all the factors, except for the presence and level
   of activities. Significant differences between students in the flipped
   and control sections were observed for low-level Bloom's questions only.
   Thus, the positive effect of the flipped-classroom approach on student
   learning may be due to improvements in recall of basic concepts and a
   better understanding of biology vocabulary in their first biology
   course.},

   of research clinics, which are a blend of a flipped classroom and a
   research/reference consultation. These clinics are designed to meet
   students at their point of need for research projects and allow students
   to choose what sort of library help will be the most beneficial at that
   moment. At the end of the pilot year, students and librarians reported
   high levels of satisfaction with the new model. Both students and
   librarians enjoyed the one-on-one interaction, and librarians felt
   sessions were more consistently successful. The research clinic model is
   a flexible approach with implications beyond the first-year composition
   classroom.},

Title = {Helps from flipped classroom in learning suturing skill: The medical
   students' perspective},
Journal = {PLOS ONE},
Year = {2018},
Volume = {13},
Number = {10},
Month = {OCT 2},
Abstract = {Background
   Today, flipped classroom (FC) has been widely used in medical education.
   However, the effectiveness of FC remains controversial. The variation
   may cause by different subjects or different course design. Moreover,
   those studies did not explain how the association among different
   domains of learning objective was in FCs. The purpose of this study was
   to explore the help of learning domains from a FC of suturing skill in
   year-5 medical students.
   Design
   This study determined sample size according to statistical power. A
   minimum number of 77 participants for regression analysis are needed.
   Therefore, this study enrolled 78 medical students in a 2-hour suturing
   course, which consisted of pre-class video and in-class instruction.
   Both simple and mattress suturing were taught. The students received an
   anonymous survey with questionnaire of Help from Instruction
   Questionnaire for Clinical Skills (HIQ-CS) after the course. The HIQ-CS
   was developed by medical education team according to Bloom's taxonomy,
   and its reliability was favorable (Cronbach's <\^{}>I = 0.839). Factor
   loadings among all items in the HIQ-CS was also favorable (0.790 to
   0.849). This study determined consensus of students' perspective by
   median (Me) and interquartile range (IQR), and tested mediation among
   different learning domains by regression.
   Results
   The results showed medical students agreed FC can help them in learning
   suturing (Me = 4, IQR = 1). The cognitive help (beta = .526, p < .001)
   was completely mediated by psychomotor help (beta = .399, p < .001) and
   affective help (beta = .413, p < .001) to overall helps in FC. The
   affective help (beta = .617, p< .001) was partially mediated by
   psychomotor help to overall helps in FC.
   Conclusions
   FC may help students in learning suturing skill in different domains.
   Our model explains the cognitive help from FC provides an important
   foundation for the helps of other domains. Although the model should be
   examined by different curricula and measurements in future, the model of
   help from instruction in our study provided an innovated concept and
   framework in medical education.},

Abstract = {The present study explores the efficiency of the flipped classroom
   approach on English for Academic Purposes (EAP) students' academic
   vocabulary acquisition in comparison with the conventional teaching
   approach. The efficiency is examined by evaluating students' post-test
   performance, self-perceived mental effort employed in completing
   post-test tasks, and perceptions regarding the learning experiences. To
   this end, 60 undergraduates divided into flipped (E) and conventional
   (C) group participated in the survey. Quantitative data analysis
   revealed that the flipped classroom approach showed higher instructional
   efficiency than the conventional approach as the E group significantly
   outperformed the C group and reported investing considerably lower
   mental effort in completing the post-test tasks. In addition, the E
   group expressed significantly more positive perceptions toward the
   learning experience than the C group. Considering the positive results
   obtained in the study, the article points out the use of the flipped
   approach as an example of good practice for enhancing academic
   vocabulary acquisition in EAP context.},

Abstract = {This paper aims at verifying whether the students' phraseological
   competence on the subject Specialized Translation (English), on the 4th
   academic year of the BA in Translation and Interpretation during the
   year 2019-2020, improved utilizing diverse types of tasks through
   blogging within the Flipped Classroom context. For this, we developed a
   didactic experience. These tasks were useful for learners to create
   their blog which focuses on the specialized themes which they studied in
   the subject of Specialized Translation. To assess this didactic
   experience, learners answered two questionnaires: an initial diagnostic
   in order to know about the learners' previous knowledge on
   phraseological units as well as their familiarity with blogging and
   flipped classroom, and a second questionnaire in order to assess the
   learners' progress at the end of the experiment. Moreover, we also
   analysed the quality of the translations utilizing evaluation metrics
   such as precision, recall, WER and BLEU. In addition, final assessment
   tools were used in order to evaluate the students' progress.},

Title = {To Flip or Not to Flip? A Meta-Analysis of the Efficacy of Flipped

Abstract = {Although flipped classroom pedagogies have been widely touted for their
   ability to foster diverse 21st-century learning objectives, previous
   syntheses of flipped learning have focused almost exclusively on
   outcomes related to academic achievement. Using data from 317 studies,
   our research addresses this deficit by providing a comprehensive
   meta-analysis of the effects of flipped versus lecture-based learning on
   academic, intra-/interpersonal, and satisfaction-related outcomes in
   higher education. Overall, flipped classroom interventions produced
   positive gains across all three learning domains, and we found
   significant advantages of flipped over lecture-based instruction for
   seven out of eight outcomes (gs = 0.20-0.53). At the same time, there
   was substantial heterogeneity in flipped learning effects, and we
   identified several variables that influenced the relative efficacy of
   flipped versus traditional courses. Of the three types of moderators
   examined (contextual, design-based, and methodological), educational
   context (e.g., discipline, location) accounted for the most variability
   in flipped learning outcomes.},

Abstract = {In recent years, the flipped classroom has become prevalent in many
   educational settings. Flipped classroom adopts a pedagogical model in
   which short video lectures are viewed by students at home before class
   so that the teacher can lead students to participate in activities,
   problem-solving, and discussions. Yet the design or use of technology
   that employs planned instructional strategies with sustainable support
   of self-regulation is scant. We propose a technology-enhanced flipped
   language learning system (Flip2Learn) that provides facilitation and
   guidance for learning performance and self-regulation. A
   quasi-experimental study was carried out to examine whether Flip2Learn
   could enhance college students' self-regulatory skills and later
   contribute to the learning performance in the flipped classrooms. The
   results showed that Flip2Learn not only better prepared students for
   flipped classrooms but also better promoted learning performance
   compared to the conventional flipped classrooms. The results of this
   research advanced our understanding of the dynamics of flipped
   classrooms and represented a revolutionary new approach to the
   technology-enhanced learning for flipped classrooms.},

Abstract = {The flipped classroom is becoming a popular new instructional model in
   higher education capable of increasing student performance in
   higher-order learning outcomes. However, the success of a flipped
   classroom model depends on various supporting elements, and it may not
   be appropriate for all students and courses. In this study, a new
   blended Biochemistry classroom model based on Massive Open Online
   Courses (MOOC) and a ``semi-flipped{''} environment was applied to
   Biochemistry instruction of Nursing and Clinical Medicine majors. The
   students' academic performance and perceptions of self-cognition were
   used to assess the blended Biochemistry classroom. Students who
   participated in the blended classroom model achieved higher academic
   performance (p < 0.01) and reported a significant improvement in their
   perceptions of self-cognition (p < 0.05) compared to the control group.
   Moreover, the effectiveness of the blended Biochemistry classroom on the
   small size class (Nursing major) was stronger than on the large size
   class (Clinical Medicine major).},

Abstract = {This study analyzes the effectiveness of adding educational gaming
   elements into the online lecture system of the flipped classroom as a
   method to increase participation and interest in online preparation
   before class. This study held an understanding sequence for 20 classes
   during the 7-week automation equipment class with 30s year high school
   students in Incheon's specialized technical high school as target. After
   the class, the learning attitude of learners was measured through
   surveys and in-depth interviews. As a result, first, it was found that
   the degree of preparation participation in flip learning using gaming
   elements had a statistically significant increase from 65.56\% to
   78.89\%, compared with the traditional flip learning using YouTube.
   Second, comparing the academic achievements showed a diagnostic
   assessment of 57.44 before applying the gaming elements and 20.17 after
   the application. However, for summative assessment, the degree after
   applying gaming elements was statistically higher at 84.52 than the
   degree before application, which was 78.86. Third, comparing academic
   achievement with word game results showed no significant correlation,
   and it is judged that all students were able to enjoy word games,
   regardless of their grades. Also, when the average word game scores were
   compared based on students' grades, mid-upper level students had
   statistically significant higher scores than upper level students.
   Lastly, analysis on the correlation between attitude and word game
   showed that there is a quantitatively high correlation between the
   ranking system's competitive spirit and interest. The ranking system
   increased competitive spirit, as well as interest.},

Abstract = {In a flipped classroom, class' lecture is delivered as a video to
   students before the class is held, and the actual time of the class is
   spent on problem solving and discussions. As there is a need for further
   clarification of the way of using this method, in this study, we
   assessed the effect of the sequence of flipped and lecture-based classes
   on medical students' learning and satisfaction in Emergency Medicine
   theoretical course. For this purpose, 59 medical students participated
   in this quasi-experimental study who were divided into two flipped-first
   and lecture-first groups. Eight topics were selected to be taught.
   Firstly, students took a pre-test covering these topics' objectives.
   Afterward, in the lecture-first group, 4 topics were taught through
   lecturing while the next 4 topics were taught through flipped classroom
   method. Then the teaching method was shifted for the flipped-first
   group. Finally, students answered the satisfaction survey and post-test
   questions. Indeed, not only the final score ofthe flipped-based topics
   in both groups was significantly higher than lecturebased ones (P-value
   = 0.022), but also the post-test score of all topics were significantly
   higher in the flipped-first group (P-value = 0.032). In addition, the
   satisfaction score for the flipped-based topics was higher than the
   lecture-based one (Pvalue = 0.011). As a conclusion, flipped classroom
   approach could increase medical students' leaming as well as their
   satisfaction and it is recommended that flipped classes be applied from
   the beginning of the course to be more effective.},

Title = {Roles and research trends of flipped classrooms in nursing education: a
   review of academic publications from 2010 to 2017},
Journal = {INTERACTIVE LEARNING ENVIRONMENTS},
Abstract = {This study reviewed the published papers on the flipped classroom in
   nursing education from 2010 to 2017, and tabulated the collected data
   from various aspects: ``before-class stage/ in-class stage/ after-class
   stage learning strategies,{''} ``application domains,{''} ``research
   issues,{''} ``participants,{''} ``research methods,{''} and
   ``nationalities{''} based on a theoretical framework. It was found that
   basic level of flipped classroom mode was frequently used in nurse
   education; that is, guiding students to watch instructional videos
   before class, and conducted discussion or practicing in the class. On
   the other hand, several effective strategies, such as Mindtools and
   game-based learning, were seldom adopted; in addition, several important
   educational issues, such as learning behavior, were not investigated in
   flipped nursing education research. It was also found that most of the
   studies did not design after-class activities to engage students in
   organizing and applying what they had learned from multiple units in a
   project-based task. Accordingly, several suggestions for future studies
   are proposed.},

Title = {Flipping the Classroom in Otolaryngology Residencies},
Journal = {CUREUS},
Year = {2020},
Volume = {12},
Number = {7},
Month = {JUL 3},
Abstract = {Objective
   To understand the use of the flipped classroom (FC) - learning core
   content prior to an academic session, with class time devoted to
   applying this content - in otolaryngology residency education.
   Methods
   An electronic survey of 107 otolaryngology program directors (PDs),
   including demographic details, the flipped classroom perception
   instrument (FCPI), and the otolaryngology programs' current use of FC.
   Results
   Forty-four (41\%) PDs completed the FCPI. Seventy-one point one (71.1\%)
   of respondents were male, 60\% were 30-49 years, and the remainder were
   older. Sixty-two percent (62\%) had fellowships associated with their
   program, 21.7\% of programs used the FC model Very Often, 17.4\%
   Somewhat Often, 28.3\% Sometimes, 17.4\% Somewhat Rarely, 8.7\% Very
   Rarely, and 6.5\% Never.
   Attitudes toward FC principles were positive with modes ``strongly
   agree{''} for all, except for ``online modules enhance learning{''}
   where the mode was ``slightly agree{''} with significantly higher scores
   for PDs over age 50 than for those younger (4.17 vs. 3.63, p=0.033).
   There were no other significant differences comparing male vs. female
   PDs, younger vs. older PDs, smaller vs. larger programs, programs with
   or without fellowships, programs with 100\% vs. <100\% board exam pass
   rates, or programs in different geographical regions. The pre-class
   activity mean score was 4.34 (95\% CI 4.12-4.56) and the in-class mean
   score was 4.18 (95\% CI 3.99-4.37). There was no significant correlation
   between the likelihood of using a flipped classroom and attitude scores.
   Conclusion
   PDs value both the pre-class and interactive in-class principles of FCs
   but only 37.8\% of programs use FC often, suggesting that practical
   approaches to implementation in this group could improve education in
   this population.},

Title = {IMAGINATION IN SCIENCE: AN EXCURSUS FROM ANCIENT DEBATES TO MODERN
   STUDIES OF COMPLEX MATERIALS TO SUGGEST A FLIPPED CLASSROOM APPROACH},

Abstract = {After the Cultural Revolution in the seventeenth century, several poets
   believed that science was killing the beauty of art and poetry. So,
   imagination has been believed to be as opposite to scientific method.
   Fortunately, this point of view has been generally abandoned now, and
   the important role of imagination in science is finally well recognized.
   Particularly in the field of material science, the structural and
   dynamical properties of a system are usually unpredictable from their
   constituents, since they come generally from the emerging behavior of
   assemblies constituted by a huge number of building blocks, so
   imagination is indicated as an essential tool for (i) thinking
   experiments, (ii) interpretating their results and (iii) preparing novel
   materials. This makes the topic absolutely fit for a typical flipped
   classroom approach. Younger students may make their first knowledge of
   the use of imagination in science by searching for the debates taken
   place over the centuries: interesting stories, debates and sometimes
   enjoying aspects can be found, and this can surely trigger interest in
   the study up to the investigation of modern complex materials. Then, at
   school, the stories, ideas, and opinions can be consolidated under the
   coordination of the teacher. In this ambit, it is obvious that
   interdisciplinarity is a key ingredient which can surely emerge from the
   activities. With an eye to future perspectives, final comments and
   examples of modern research activity will be also reported to show how
   imagination can help in setting up smart procedures to prepare novel
   materials in modern science.},

Title = {Exploring the role of sociability, sense of community and course
   satisfaction on students' engagement in flipped classroom supported by
   facebook groups},
Journal = {JOURNAL OF COMPUTERS IN EDUCATION},
Abstract = {In recent years, how students' engagement can be developed in flipped
   classroom (FC) model has become a critical issue addressed in an
   educational context. Evidence suggests that students' behavioral,
   cognitive, and emotional engagement may decrease in FC in time. It is
   thought that social networking sites (SNS) can contribute to this
   problem in FC. Since it is believed that students will show greater
   interest in discussions and knowledge exchange about the course,
   supporting courses with SNS is significant in terms of providing
   students with a social learning environment, it is assumed that
   students' role of sociability, sense of community, and course
   satisfaction will increase, thereby promoting students' engagement in
   those courses supported by SNS. This assumption appears in the
   literature as a gap that needs to be explored. In this sense, the
   purpose of this current research is to examine perceived sociability,
   sense of community, and student satisfaction and to determine how these
   variables predict behavioral, cognitive, and emotional engagement of
   students in FC supported by a virtual learning community. A total of 219
   university students at a state university in Turkey. The research was
   carried out in the Computing I course conducted according to the FC
   model, and it was supported by the virtual learning community created on
   Facebook. Knowledge sharing and discussions about the course were made
   in Facebook groups. The data draws on students' responses via three
   self-report instruments: satisfaction scale, students' engagement scale,
   perceived sociability scale, and sense of community scale. Stepwise
   multiple linear regression was conducted for the data analysis. The
   findings indicate that students' engagement in FC applications supported
   by the Facebook-based virtual learning community is high. Regarding
   sub-dimensions, students' behavioral and emotional engagement scores are
   high, while cognitive engagement is moderate. Additionally, perceived
   sociability, sense of community, and satisfaction are significant
   predictors of students' engagement. Several implications and future
   research recommendations are discussed.},

Abstract = {This article presents an action research study examining the
   implementation of flipped classroom model supported with Web 2.0
   technology to provide opportunities to use the target language and to
   motivate learners. Our participants were 12th grade language class
   students who were learning English as foreign language in a state school
   in Turkey. Our data came from a variety of sources including pre-and
   post-treatment questionnaires, teacher journals, lesson evaluation
   forms, observation tasks, and semi-structured interviews. Our findings
   revealed that participating students held positive perceptions and a
   high level of motivation towards the integration of Web 2.0 technology
   to Flipped Classroom in their English language learning process.
   Additionally, they reported a number of advantages associated with
   flipped learning model and Web 2.0 tools such as increased readiness to
   the lesson, improvement in variety of language and 4C (i.e., critical
   thinking, creative thinking, communicating and collaborating) skills,
   fostered teamwork and boosted creativity. In light of our findings, we
   propose pedagogical implications for EFL practices.},

Abstract = {Bronchoscopy programs implementing the experiential learning model
   address different learning styles. Problem-based learning improves
   knowledge retention, critical decision making, and communication. These
   modalities are preferred by learners and contribute to their engagement,
   in turn leading to durable learning. Follow-up after live events is
   warranted through spaced education strategies. The objectives of this
   article are to (1) summarize and illustrate the implementation of
   experiential learning theory for bronchoscopy courses, (2) discuss the
   flipped classroom model and problem-based learning, (3) illustrate
   bronchoscopy checklists implementation in simulation, and (4) discuss
   the importance of feedback and spaced learning for bronchoscopy
   education programs.},

Abstract = {Purpose This study aims to assess students' learning performance and
   perceived need satisfaction between a gamified flipped classroom (GFC)
   and flipped classroom (FC) instruction in a low-tech setting. The
   iSpring Learn learning management system was used as a low-tech
   gamification application in gamifying the flipped learning class.
   Design/methodology/approach A quantitative research approach was used
   for collecting the data. Three formative assessments were used to
   examine students' learning performance during the intervention period,
   and a post-questionnaire survey was used to support the data collection
   process with regard to students' perceived needs satisfaction. In total,
   56 students were involved in a non-randomised experiment with a control
   group design. Findings The results reveal that Assessment 1 showed no
   significant difference between the two intervention groups (p > 0.05),
   while Assessments 2 and 3 were significantly different (p < 0.05). The
   survey results confirm that participants in the GFC have achieved a
   great level of motivation because their innate psychological needs for
   competence, autonomy and relatedness are satisfied. Originality/value
   Gamification as a current concept of a twenty-first-century
   instructional skill has proven to be remarkably influential. This study
   suggests that the FC and gamification concept might be possibly
   implemented in a low-tech information environment - without the required
   advanced technology platform.},

Title = {Improving performance in a large flipped barrier mathematics course: a
   longitudinal case study},
Journal = {INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF MATHEMATICAL EDUCATION IN SCIENCE AND
   TECHNOLOGY},
Abstract = {Flipped classrooms are increasingly popular due to improvements in
   online technology and expected benefits in student engagement and
   learning. Although research has increased dramatically in the last 10
   years, few studies have assessed the effectiveness of flipping large
   enrollment, barrier mathematics courses. Creating a comprehensive
   flipped classroom learning experience that includes high quality
   in-class activities can be particularly challenging in large classrooms,
   especially when implemented for the first time. However, improving
   engagement and learning in these courses would be particularly helpful
   in improving STEM graduation rates. This paper describes a longitudinal
   analysis of student performance and opinions in a differential equations
   course over three years with three different instructional strategies:
   traditional lecture, initial flipped, and revised flipped. We found that
   flipping the course reduced withdrawal rates and improved pass rates,
   but the initial iteration reduced exam performance. We then observed a
   positive change in exam performance and student opinion from the initial
   to the revised flipped course. We conclude that the flipped classroom
   can be effective in large mathematics courses required for STEM degrees,
   although it may not be possible to see all benefits in an initial
   implementation.},

Abstract = {The flipped classroom methodology is becoming increasingly widespread in
   the university environment but its implications have not been fully
   analyzed yet. This study highlights the key aspects for a successful
   implementation of the inverted classroom and formulates didactic
   objectives that are essential for the meaningful learning of
   Experimental Sciences. The study has been carried out in the context of
   the subject Sciences of Matter and Energy in three degrees linked to the
   Degree in Teaching in Primary Education, and covers more than 200
   students, both in the experimental group and in the control group. This
   study has been tackled through three instruments: the academic
   performance of the different parts of the subject; discussion groups of
   the teaching staff involved; and the final questionnaire completed by
   the students. The analysis shows a significant improvement in the
   academic results in the majority, as well as positive results in their
   expectations as future science teachers and in the development of
   positive attitudes towards science. In addition, the benefits achieved
   during the teaching-learning process are analyzed, such as the
   development of meta-cognition capacity, the change of roles of teachers
   and students, a better feedback, and a higher level of cognitive
   achievement. Finally, these results are discussed on the basis of those
   key aspects of the inverted classroom with the inclusion of the didactic
   objectives typical of Experimental Sciences, as well as the view of the
   teaching staff throughout it.},

Title = {The effect of live demonstration and flipped classroom with continuous
   formative assessment on dental students' orthodontic wire-bending
   performance},
Journal = {BMC MEDICAL EDUCATION},

Abstract = {Background: Wire-bending skills is commonly taught through live
   demonstrations (LD) though flipped classroom (FC) method has gained
   popularity. Continuous formative assessment promotes personalised
   learning via closely monitored progress, with the identification of
   students' strengths and weaknesses. This study aims to evaluate the
   effects of LD and FC teaching methods, supplemented with continuous
   formative assessment, on dental students' learning of wire-bending
   skills for six types of removable orthodontic appliance components. A
   deeper understanding of the relative effectiveness between LD and FC
   teaching methods can help identify the most appropriate method to
   achieve student learning objectives, which is especially important given
   the current Covid-19 pandemic.
   Methods: Forty third-year undergraduate dental students were randomly
   assigned into FC (n=20) or LD (n=20) cohort. Each student attended six
   teaching sessions, each to teach students' competency in fabricating one
   type of wire component, for a total competency in fabricating six wire
   components over the course of six teaching sessions. Either LD or FC
   teaching methods were used. After each session, wire assignments had to
   be submitted. Wire assignments were then evaluated using a blinded
   wire-bending assessment protocol. As part of their formative assessment,
   the assessment results were distributed to students, lecturers, and
   technicians before the next session. After the first session (T0) and at
   the end of all six sessions (T1), students completed a self-reported
   questionnaire.
   Results: The mean wire-bending scores for FC were significantly higher
   than LD for two of the six assignments, namely the Adams clasp (p<0.01)
   and Z-spring (p=0.03). Scores for both LD and FC increased significantly
   over time, which may be attributed to formative assessment. There was no
   statistically significant correlation between wire-bending scores and
   video usage. Students were satisfied with both teaching methods,
   according to T0 and T1 questionnaires.
   Conclusions: Both LD and FC are equally effective in transferring
   practical orthodontic wire-bending skills and well-received by students.
   Continuous formative assessment may have enhanced students' learning of
   orthodontic wire-bending skills. Further studies with control group are
   recommended to investigate the effect of formative assessment on
   teaching practical dental skills.},

Abstract = {Aim: The flipped classroom is an educational strategy gaining popularity
   for its growing evidence base that suggests it may successfully improve
   learning outcomes. Also known as reverse instruction, this approach has
   been typically implemented and studied in in-person post-secondary
   settings. The utilization of a flipped approach in the healthcare
   education literature has been examined in a wide range of contexts, but
   little has been written regarding continuing professional development
   (CPD). Therefore, with success in other contexts there is potential for
   the flipped classroom approach to enhance student satisfaction, learner
   engagement, and learning outcomes in the context of online education for
   CPD. Methods: In this paper, we describe the structure and format of
   such a course using a qualitative case study framework.Results: This
   study contributes to a more comprehensive understanding of effective
   ways of overcoming distributed learning challenges in online CPD using a
   flipped approach.},

Abstract = {Despite increasing evidence that the traditional lecture is inefficient
   for student learning, such methods remain the central paradigm for
   teaching logic. In this paper, I identify the deficits of the lecture
   model and outline the many benefits of flipping the logic
   classroom-namely that students can absorb information at their own pace,
   freeing classroom time for active learning activities, and allowing the
   students to come prepared to actively engage in deeper levels of
   learning. I provide advice for curricular change from the traditional
   model, and guidance for flipped classroom implementation. I also offer
   suggestions for the best use of newly available class time, and advice
   for keeping students accountable for learning the information prior to
   class. Last, I consider common challenges with the flipped classroom
   model. I acknowledge possible obstacles to flipping the undergraduate
   logic course and address these challenges with potential solutions.},

Title = {A comparison of flipped learning with gamification, traditional

Volume = {28},

Month = {MAY 18},
Abstract = {This study examines Grade 9 students' mathematics achievement and
   cognitive engagement under three different instructional approaches:
   traditional learning, flipped learning with gamification, and online
   independent study with gamification. The duration of the study lasted an
   entire school year. The central theories underpinning flipped learning
   with gamification design were based on the first principles of
   Instruction and self-determination theory. A mixed methods approach was
   used with quantitative (i.e., tests and an optional assignment) and
   qualitative (i.e., student interviews) methods applied. The test results
   indicate that students in the flipped class (n = 28) significantly
   outperformed those in the traditional (n = 27) and online independent
   study (n = 21) classes. In addition, flipped learning with gamification
   promoted students' cognitive engagement better than the other two
   approaches. The findings of student interviews suggest that peer
   interactions inside the flipped classroom were critical to promoting
   students' mathematics achievement and cognitive engagement, as opposed
   to online learning resources and gamification per se. In future
   practice, teachers can ground their flipped classroom design in the
   theoretical framework proposed in this study.},

Title = {``Flipped classrooms{''} in training in maxillofacial surgery:
   preparation before the traditional didactic lecture?},

Abstract = {While virtual learning environments (VLE) can be used in medical
   education as stand-alone educational interventions, they can also be
   used in preparation for traditional ``face-to-face{''} training sessions
   as part of a ``flipped classroom{''} model. We sought to evaluate the
   introduction of this model in a single module on maxillofacial radiology
   from a course on trauma skills. Course delegates were randomised into
   two groups: one was given access to an e-learning resource (test group)
   and the other attended a traditional didactic lecture (control group).
   Knowledge and confidence were assessed before and after the course with
   a 20-question single-best-answer paper and a 10-situation 100 mm visual
   analogue scale (VAS) paper, respectively. All participants were then
   given free access to the VLE for 30 days and were invited to take part
   in an e-survey. Neither group showed improvements in the
   single-best-answer scores, but both groups showed comparable
   improvements in VAS (control: median (range) values improved from 40.8
   (17.7-82.5) mm to 62.8 (35.3-88.7) mm, p = 0.001; test group: from 47.7
   (10.9-58.1) mm to 60.5 (32.4-75.6) mm, p = 0.005). Half of the
   respondents stated that they preferred the ``flipped classroom{''}
   approach, and 22/22 stated that they would be ``likely{''} or ``very
   likely{''} to use an e-learning resource with expanded content. The
   ``flipped classroom{''} approach was well received and there were
   comparable improvements in confidence. As maxillofacial radiology lends
   itself to online instruction with its reliance on the recognition of
   patterns, and problem-based approach to learning, a piloted e-learning
   resource could be developed in this area. (C) 2018 The British

Abstract = {In the teaching based on MOOC (Massive Open Online Courses) and flipped
   classroom, a teacher needs to understand the difficulty and importance
   of MOOC videos in real time for students at different knowledge levels.
   In this way, a teacher can be more focused on the different difficulties
   and key points contained in the videos for students in a flipped
   classroom. Thus, the personalized teaching can be implemented. We
   propose an approach of MOOC video personalized classification based on
   cluster analysis and process mining to help a teacher understand the
   difficulty and importance of MOOC videos for students at different
   knowledge levels. Specifically, students are first clustered based on
   their knowledge levels through question answering data. Then, we propose
   the process model of a group of students which reflects the overall
   video watching behavior of these students. Next, we propose to use the
   process mining technique to mine the process model of each student
   cluster by the video watching data of the involved students. Finally, we
   propose an approach to measure the difficulty and importance of a video
   based on a process model. With this approach, MOOC videos can be
   classified for students at different knowledge levels according to
   difficulty and importance. Therefore, a teacher can carry out a flipped
   classroom more efficiently. Experiments on a real data set show that the
   difficulty and importance of videos obtained by the proposed approach
   can reflect students' subjective evaluation of the videos.},

Abstract = {The promotion and application of computer technology in the education
   field has been driving the continuous innovation and development of
   traditional teaching methods. As a new type of blended learning model,
   flipping classroom can be well combined with computer technology to
   effectively improve the quality of education and teaching in colleges
   and universities. he Moodle provides a good network support platform for
   the implementation of flipping classroom. This paper aims to develop a
   new flipped classroom teaching model. Supported by Moodle and adhering
   to the philosophy of self-learning, this teaching model arranges
   learning tasks according to the different characteristics and needs of
   learners. Through interactions, it can develop students' self-learning
   abilities and improve their learning efficiency; through online
   tracking, it can understand students' learning dynamics in time and
   guide them in preview of knowledge points before class to allow them to
   think clearly. The purpose of this paper is to study the effects of the
   flipped classroom teaching method based on Moodle so as to find out what
   to improve in this model and make it widely applied in college teaching
   to cultivate more applied talents.},

Journal = {CURRENT TRENDS IN TRANSLATION TEACHING AND LEARNING E},

Abstract = {The role of translation theory in translator education seems to be
   undergoing a crisis as universities struggle to provide graduates with
   practical, market-driven skills that will increase their employability.
   The overnight transition to online delivery in the time of educational
   disruption caused by the COVID-19 pandemic has only heightened the
   challenges in making theoretical courses relevant for students. This
   paper explores the application of the flipped classroom model in a
   translation theory course on the graduate (MA) level, delivered in the
   context of emergency remote teaching. The course is described and
   evaluated with the help of student feedback (N=30) elicited via an
   online questionnaire. The main source of data are responses to
   open-ended questions, which are analysed qualitatively. The data are
   coded for general perceptions of the flipped classroom and its four
   course components (videos, experimental translation assignments, forum
   discussion assignments, synchronous Zoom discussions), as well as for
   perceptions of teacher support. Lessons are drawn for emergency remote
   teaching but also for future face-to-face teaching of theory-oriented
   translation courses.},

Abstract = {We live in a world permeated by digital technologies. Still, however,
   this digitization is not always reflected in the learning environments
   of higher education institutions, which raises questions about the
   adequacy of the instructional outcomes. In this paper, I maintain that
   the concept of the inverted or flipped classroom may be a fruitful path
   to including learning ``hands-on{''} with technology even in learning
   environments absent of any technological resources. The rationale for
   this proposition is that flipped elements transfer the demand for
   technology from the teaching environment to the student. I report on a
   design-based research project to put this claim to a first test. The
   qualitative and quantitative data collected all support the idea that
   flipped classroom elements may help overcome differences in terms of
   availability of technology in different learning environments. The
   implications for universities and higher education teachers are
   discussed.},

Abstract = {This essay mainly represents the spirit that transcends philosophy
   framed in the new EEES, and in line with these new approaches to
   teaching, this paper raises new pedagogical resources that give greater
   prominence to the student in the learning process. Running away from the
   traditional lectures and written works, they raised this initiative
   based on the flipped classroom methodology and advantages offered TICS
   to the student. This pedagogical model transfers the work of processes
   of learning outside the classroom, devoting class time to work the
   aspects in which it is required the teacher ` s support and experience.
   This text presents two projects of flipped classroom methodology. Both
   cases had started with the objective of implementing the educational
   platform Lynda as training in university teaching resource. They
   proposed to the student conduct training sessions with the teacher. So
   they had to employ Lynda platform and viewing videos of courses related
   to the materials. Each one had goals and different evaluation criteria,
   but they shared the same methodology. The results obtained make to think
   about need to motivate the student to invest time before the session
   with the teacher.},

Abstract = {The flipped classroom has shown a positive effect on academic
   performance and student satisfaction. However, there are relatively few
   studies that help us understand when or why this method has a positive
   effect on students, so as to aid the design of a flipped class. In this
   study, an instrument for assessing the student learning experience in
   flipped courses is proposed and validated, comparing the results of
   their application over two semesters in a university-level programming
   class with three flipped sections (n = 151) and four conventional ones
   (n = 226). We found that with a similar score in terms of learning
   experience, the achievement in a flipped course is slightly higher than
   in a lecture-based course, F(1,108) = 4.20, p = 0.04, d = 0.19. A
   multiple regression analysis was conducted for the effect on achievement
   of GPA, level of challenge, feedback and enjoyment. By controlling for
   these factors, students in flipped classes achieved higher scores than
   students in lecture-based courses, beta = 0.1, t(370) = 2.4, p = 0.02.
   The expected improvement in achievement increases when features of the
   flipped classroom improve the student experience. Our results suggest
   that the design of a flipped class should consider the effect of
   different implementation features on student experience in order to
   select the most appropriate ones for a particular context.},

Abstract = {Background: Blended learning, which combines internet-based platform and
   lecturing, is used in anaesthesiology and critical care teaching.
   However, the benefits of this method remain unclear.
   Methods: We conducted a prospective, multicentre, non-randomised work
   between 2007 and 2014 to study the effect of blended learning on the
   results of first year anaesthesia and critical care residents in
   comparison with traditional teaching. Blended learning was implemented
   in Rouen University Hospital in 2011 and residents affiliated to this
   university corresponded as the blended learning group. The primary
   outcome was the resident's results as measured with multiple-choice
   questions between blended learning and control groups after beginning
   blended learning (post-interventional stage). The secondary outcomes
   included residents' results between pre and post-interventional stages
   and homework's time. Moreover, comparison between control and blended
   learning group before beginning blended learning (pre-interventional
   stage) was performed.
   Results: From 2007 to 2014, 308 residents were included. For the
   pre-interventional period, the mean score in the blended learning group
   (n = 53) was 176 (CI 95\% 163 to 188) whereas the mean score in the
   control group (n = 106) was 167 (CI 95\% 160 to 174) (no difference).
   For the post-interventional period, the mean score in blended learning
   group (n = 54) was 232 on 300 (CI95\% 227-237) whereas the mean score in
   the control group (n = 95) is 215 (CI95\% 209-220) (P < 0.001). In the
   two groups, comparison between pre and post-interventional stages showed
   the increase of mean score, stronger for blended learning group (32\%
   and 28\% in blended learning and control group, P < 0.05). The average
   time of homework in the blended learning group was 27 h (CI 95\%
   18.2-35.8) and 10 h in the control group (CI 95\% 2-18) (P < 0.05).
   Conclusions: This work suggests the positive effect of blended learning
   (associating internet-based learning and flipped classroom) on the
   anaesthesia and critical care residents' knowledge by increasing their
   homework's time. (C) 2017 Published by Elsevier Masson SAS on behalf of

Abstract = {Recent changes in anatomy education have seen the introduction of
   flipped classrooms as a replacement to the traditional didactic lecture.
   This approach utilizes the increasing availability of digital technology
   to create learning resources that can be accessed prior to attending
   class, with face-to-face sessions then becoming more student-centered
   via discussion, collaborative learning, and problem-solving activities.
   Although this approach may appear intuitive, this viewpoint commentary
   presents a counter opinion and highlights a simple alternative that
   utilizes evidence-based active learning approaches as part of the
   traditional lecture. The active lecture takes the traditional lecture,
   and (1) ensures the lecture content is relevant and has clear
   objectives, (2) contains lecture material that is designed according to
   the latest evidence-base, (3) complements it with additional
   supplementary material, (4) creates space to check prior understanding
   and knowledge levels, and (5) utilizes suitable technology to facilitate
   continual engagement and interaction. Clin. Anat. 31:118-121, 2018. (c)

Title = {An upgrade of the Malmo model by implementing case-based teaching and
   learning, in an undergraduate dental education},

Abstract = {Background At our dental education, the examination failure rate amongst
   students has increased, resulting in subsequent involuntary dropouts.
   One of the main problems seems to be that the students struggle with
   taking the necessary responsibility for their learning, as required by
   the problem-based learning (PBL) methodology.
   Aim To describe the background to, and the transition process from, pure
   PBL to case-based teaching and learning (CBT) with flipped classroom
   seminars at the dental programme at {[}anonymised for peer review].
   Methods In this position paper, we describe our observed problems with
   the PBL methodology, as implemented at this faculty, and the potential
   benefits of a change towards CBT. The current implementation of CBT is
   presented, along with educational research supporting the choice of
   activities.
   Results Tentative findings are that the flipped classroom seminars and
   the clearer instructions appear to be successful with higher levels of
   activity, engagement and attendance amongst the students, and the
   students have evaluated the seminars as very good learning activities.
   Conclusion Tentative findings suggest that the current implementation of
   CBT may be a fruitful way of teaching in dental education today. Most of
   the teaching staff have been reawakened to teaching, and as a result,
   the content of the courses are being reviewed and improved. The students
   appreciate that what is expected of them has been made clearer and that
   there is a variety of learning activities.},

Abstract = {The purpose of the research was to establish whether `blended
   learner-led learning' could impact learners' motivation, interaction and
   academic achievement. The researchers set about adapting Flipped
   Classroom Method by allowing small teams of undergraduate students to
   share the responsibility of preparing online materials and then
   administering them using Flipped Classroom Method, under the guidance
   and supervision of the lecturer. Flipped Classroom Method is currently a
   popular pedagogical approach that utilizes instructional technology
   combining face to face learning with online learning. This has a number
   of advantages: it allows learners to access materials online at any time
   or place and engages learners in a more active, constructivist learning
   environment. However, it poses challenges for teachers and students who
   are more used to a conventional approach to teaching and learning
   because it challenges a traditional teacher-student relationship where
   the teacher is seen as the central authority for knowledge and learning.
   Moreover, it requires a lot of effort on the part of the teacher to
   prepare all the online resources. The researchers conducted a
   quasi-experiment with an undergraduate course called `Curriculum and
   Instruction' that lasted five weeks. The purpose was to see the effects
   of blended learner-led learning on students' motivation, interaction and
   academic achievement. The results show that blended learner-led learning
   had a statistically significant impact on all three for the experimental
   group. Consequently, it represents a viable alternative for instructors
   seeking a constructivist pedagogy that maintains adab and respect for
   the teacher.},

Abstract = {Social work programs need to prepare students for practice in assessing
   mental health, addictions, and suicide risk assessment. In response to a
   call for increased training, we partnered with community social workers
   and re-designed a course on social work practice in mental health using
   a flipped classroom approach. We conducted a qualitative study using
   focus groups and individual interviews with MSW students (N = 15) to
   explore student perspectives on re-designed teaching approaches.
   Participants identified three teaching methods that increased knowledge,
   skills, and self-awareness: online educational modules, simulation, and
   integrated teaching with scaffolded learning. We discuss implications
   for social work education and practice.},

Title = {THE USE OF MIX PLATFORM FOR ORGANIZING BLENDED LEARNING IN TEACHING
   GENERAL CHEMISTRY TO STUDENTS OF ENGINEERING SPECIALTIES},
Journal = {INFORMATION TECHNOLOGIES AND LEARNING TOOLS},
Year = {2020},
Volume = {75},
Number = {1},
Pages = {138-152},
Abstract = {The relevance of the article is stipulated by the fact that systematic
   studies on blended learning in teaching Chemistry in higher educational
   establishments are not thoroughly presented. The expediency of
   implementation of flipped classroom model in teaching General Chemistry
   to the prospective engineers is substantiated. It is found that mixing
   of traditional (in person) and distance learning is one of the most
   common blended combinations. The models for blended learning, which are
   classified according to the ratio of the traditional form of education
   to the electronic one and the degree of students' independence during
   educational material assimilation, are presented. Within the framework
   of the pedagogical experiment, the flipped classroom model has been
   chosen since its implementation does not require any changes in the
   curriculum. During the pedagogical experiment, educational and
   methodological materials have been placed on the MIX platform of Sumy
   State University electronic resource. The model for studying topics on
   General Chemistry is proposed. The analysis of the results of the
   pedagogical experiment has shown the following: 1) the achievements of
   students from experimental groups is significantly higher than those
   from control ones; 2) students consider blended learning to be modern,
   convenient and more effective; 3) when working independently with
   electronic resources students prefer the presentation with audio and
   video accompaniment to text material, although the latter is well
   illustrated; 4) to motivate students to work regularly and
   independently, it is advisable to introduce a coefficient (we have 1.5),
   which multiplies all the marks for a particular topic, in case a student
   has independently passed the test on a new topic by at least 60\%. The
   use of flipped classroom blended learning model in General Chemistry
   teaching enhances the efficiency of educational process, as well as
   prospective engineers' acquisition of subject competence in General
   Chemistry. Dispersive analysis of the pedagogical experiment results has
   shown their validity.},

Abstract = {With the marketisation of higher education, student satisfaction and
   perceived learning outcomes have become popular measures of the quality
   of education. Significant pressure is placed on faculty to increase
   these measures by delivering engaging and effective classes. The current
   study compares four different learner-focused pedagogies (problem based,
   service learning, flipped classroom, and project based) to lecture
   (teacher-focused pedagogy) with regard to student satisfaction and
   perceived learning outcomes. Undergraduate business students from a
   northeastern university in the U.S. assessed their learning on four
   outcomes: knowledge acquisition, problem solving, critical thinking, and
   self-directed learning, as well as their overall satisfaction with a
   particular pedagogy. Of the four learner-focused pedagogies, only
   project based learning was perceived to have a significant impact on
   problem solving and knowledge acquisition as compared to lecture.
   Project based learning did not significantly impact critical thinking or
   self-directed learning compared to lecture. There were no significant
   differences in perceived learning outcomes between all other pedagogies
   compared to lecture. Additionally, students indicated no significant
   differences in satisfaction across lecture, problem based learning,
   service learning, and flipped classroom. Student satisfaction was
   significantly higher with project based learning.},

Abstract = {The aim of this research is to examine the dimensions of junior high
   school teachers' readiness for implementing a flipped classroom approach
   and to construct and validate an instrument-the Flipped-Classroom
   Teacher Scale (FCTS). Two sets of samples (170 and 495 junior high
   school teachers) served to explore and confirm the constructs of the
   FCTS model proposed by this study. The model has been empirically
   validated via exploratory factor analysis (EFA) and confirmatory factor
   analysis. The research participants were from different geographical
   locations in Taiwan. The FCTS consists of four factors: institutional
   support, technology self-efficacy (TSE), teacher beliefs and teaching
   strategies (TS). The results show that the FCTS model is a valid and
   reliable scale. Teachers may use the FCTS to gain a greater
   understanding of their instructional design and strategies in relation
   to flipped classrooms.},

Month = {MAR},
Abstract = {Data analysis and applying knowledge to real-world settings rank among
   key skills of college graduates. This paper shows how to completely
   integrate data analysis and application of knowledge to real-world
   settings into an introductory macroeconomics course. Every class meeting
   is structured as a series of activities that students work through using
   free, publicly available data. Time can be allotted to these activities
   during class because the course takes advantage of two previously
   documented active learning pedagogies (flipped classroom and team-based
   learning). Students benefit by gaining data analysis skills, applying
   knowledge to real-world settings, digging deeper into the material and
   contentious topics, and learning that results from combining the data
   analysis approach with the active learning approaches.},

Abstract = {Background In a flipped classroom (FC) model, blended learning is used
   to increase student engagement and learning by having students finish
   their readings at home and work on problem-solving with tutors during
   class time. Evidence-based medicine (EBM) integrates clinical experience
   and patient values with the best evidence-based research to inform
   clinical decisions. To implement a FC and EBM, students require
   sufficient information acquisition and problem-solving skills.
   Therefore, a FC is regarded as an excellent teaching model for tutoring
   EBM skills. However, the effectiveness of a FC for teaching EBM
   competency has not been rigorously investigated in pre-clinical
   educational programs. In this study, we used an innovative FC model in a
   pre-clinical EBM teaching program. Methods FC's teaching was compared
   with a traditional teaching model by using an assessment framework of
   prospective propensity score matching, which reduced the potential
   difference in basic characteristics between the two groups of students
   on 1:1 ratio. For the outcome assessments of EBM competency, we used an
   analysis of covariance and multivariate linear regression analysis to
   investigate comparative effectiveness between the two teaching models. A
   total of 90 students were prospectively enrolled and assigned to the
   experimental or control group using 1:1 propensity matching. Results
   Compared with traditional teaching methods, the FC model was associated
   with better learning outcomes for the EBM competency categories of Ask,
   Acquire, Appraise, and Apply for both written and oral tests at the end
   of the course (all p-values< 0.001). In particular, the ``appraise{''}
   skill for the written test (6.87 +/- 2.20) vs. (1.47 +/- 1.74), p <
   0.001), and the ``apply{''} skill for the oral test (7.34 +/- 0.80 vs.
   3.97 +/- 1.24, p < 0.001) had the biggest difference between the two
   groups. Conclusions After adjusting for a number of potential confunding
   factors, our study findings support the effectiveness of applying an FC
   teaching model to cultivate medical students' EBM literacy.},

Abstract = {MOOCs have made it possible not only to provide quality open education
   for any learner worldwide, but also to rethink the way on-campus
   teaching is delivered. The materials produced for a MOOC can be consumed
   by on-campus students before arriving to the classroom, using class time
   to do activities that promote active learning, following this way a
   flipped classroom strategy. This paper presents the experience of
   redesigning a first-year engineering course with a large number of
   students (over 400 each year), in which MOOCs are reused, and a flipped
   classroom strategy is implemented, dedicating most of traditional
   lecture time to do hands-on, interactive activities. The results show an
   increase in students' motivation, both in the use of MOOC content
   outside the classroom, and in the realization of hands-on, interactive
   activities inside the classroom. In relation to the teacher, having
   information on students' previous work outside the classroom, and on
   students' work in the hands-on, interactive activities carried out
   inside the classroom, allows understanding better the differences
   between groups, tailoring the explanations during class time, and
   providing proper reinforcement activities to be done after class.},

Title = {Is it face time or structure and accountability that matter? Moving from
   a flipped to a flipped/hybrid classroom},

Abstract = {Purpose This research examines whether a shift to a hybrid classroom,
   which replaces some face-to-face classroom time with online instruction,
   adversely affects student learning if the structure and incentives that
   are characteristic of a flipped classroom are already in place.
   Design/methodology/approach This study features a quantitative analysis
   of individual student data collected over multiple sections of a single
   course with the same instructor. In all seven sections, over two
   semesters, principles of microeconomics used a flipped classroom format
   that features preclass video lectures, daily quizzes and highly
   interactive class time. In three of the seven sections, the time spent
   in class was reduced by one-third. For this experiment, student scores
   on the cumulative final exam evaluate student learning. Students took a
   survey at the end of the semester to provide feedback on time use during
   the course and to make observations about the class format.
   Findings Results from this study suggest that despite accountability for
   the work done outside of class, students score 4.4\% points lower on the
   final exam in the class format that features reduced face-to-face time.
   However, student comments also suggest that this is a worthwhile
   tradeoff as they balance work, internships and other nonacademic demands
   on their time. Student evaluations of the course and instructor are
   statistically unchanged.
   Practical implications Efficiency in educational delivery is an ongoing
   concern for students and faculty. This research demonstrates that a
   classroom that is both flipped and hybrid makes better use of student
   and faculty time, provides a richer learning experience and only
   modestly reduces student learning. It is notable that students report a
   preference for the hybrid classroom model, despite modestly lower levels
   of learning.
   Originality/value While research has been done on flipped and hybrid
   classrooms separately, this is the first paper to isolate the effect of
   seat time within the flipped classroom context. This research addresses
   the flipped classroom design's ability to mitigate the documented
   reduction in student learning that often results from reduced class time
   or an increase in online learning.},

Abstract = {Objective: To improve residents' knowledge, self-perceived skills, and
   attitudes about hospice.
   Methods: An online case-based curriculum in a flipped classroom design
   was provided to postgraduate year-one (PGY-1) residents. Residents
   completed a pre- and postassessment. Postgraduate year-two (PGY-2)
   residents served as a historical control.
   Results: Fifty-one PGY-1 residents received the curriculum.
   Postcurriculum knowledge scores increased significantly and were not
   statistically different from PGY-2 controls (n = 55). Postcurriculum
   confidence scores increased significantly and were statistically
   different from controls in subdomains of talking about hospice,
   facilitating the clinic to hospice transition, and seeking help with
   hospice dilemmas. Satisfaction with training in hospice was
   significantly higher after receiving the curriculum.
   Conclusion: A flipped classroom curriculum increased knowledge,
   confidence in skills, and satisfaction with residency training in
   hospice care. This design offers curriculum solutions that address
   competing demands in the new era of social distancing and remote
   learning.},

Title = {Analysis of the Practice Path of the Flipped Classroom Model Assisted by
   Big Data in English Teaching},
Journal = {SCIENTIFIC PROGRAMMING},

Abstract = {This paper makes a detailed analysis of the integrated mining algorithm,
   analyzes the characteristics of curriculum big data, and analyzes the
   existing problems of the current association rule mining algorithm, as
   well as the defects and deficiencies when applied to the curriculum
   data. Aiming at the problem of mining the entire data set by the mining
   algorithm, this topic proposes the idea of using the K-means algorithm
   for clustering processing and uses the Ball-tree structure on the basis
   of the original K-means algorithm to improve the efficiency of the
   algorithm. The data set is separated into several clusters of an
   appropriate number. In the flipped classroom, the basic knowledge is put
   before the class for learning, and the further deepening and practical
   application of language knowledge is completed in the class. Teachers
   can give timely guidance when encountering unsolvable difficulties so
   that students' learning can be more effective. This new teaching model
   not only strengthens students' confidence in learning and increases
   their interest in learning, but also increases the opportunities for
   students to interact with teachers and classmates in the classroom,
   allowing them to construct the meaning of knowledge in the fun of
   interactive communication. The classroom has become relaxed, lively, and
   attractive, and students' sense of autonomy, self-learning ability, and
   collaborative inquiry ability have also been unknowingly improved. Among
   the main factors, the willingness to flip, emotional state, leadership
   role, and online learning input have a significant positive impact on
   collaborative learning performance, and the sense of competition has a
   partial negative impact on collaborative learning performance, of which
   positively affecting individual knowledge mastery. Among the nonmain
   factors, the degree of difficulty of the course, teacher-student
   interaction, teacher motivation, and evaluation mechanism have a
   significant positive impact on collaborative learning performance.
   Classroom assistive technology has a partial negative impact on
   collaborative learning performance. From the perspective of group
   performance, group-level performance considerations such as the quality
   of group conversations and the degree of group knowledge sharing in
   collaborative learning performance are more affected by nonsubject
   factors.},

Title = {The Effect of First-Year Seminar Classroom Design on Social Integration
   and Retention of STEM First-Time, Full-Time College Freshmen},

Abstract = {Classroom design is related to student satisfaction and learning, but
   its effect on student retention is unknown. This exploratory study
   compared the impact of classroom design on social integration and
   retention among STEM first-time, full-time college freshmen in a
   first-year seminar course by comparing classroom sizes (large (LL) vs.
   small (SL) lecture), classroom formats (lecture (SL) vs. flipped
   classroom (FC)), and classroom student composition of students at risk
   of attrition based on low math placement scores (combined low math (CLM)
   vs. separated low math (SLM)). To capture social integration of freshman
   after their first semester, students completed a survey for course
   credit. Retention rates of freshman returning to the university for
   their second year were included. Almost all students in all classrooms
   had made friends in college; most had made friends with peers in the
   course and were spending time with them outside of class. Compared with
   LL students, SL reported lower satisfaction with their overall social
   life. More FC students were satisfied with their social life, and fewer
   found making friends to be harder than expected. These findings showed
   even greater disparities between groups for at-risk students. SLM
   students exhibited lower social integration than CLM students. The CLM
   flipped classroom retained the highest percentage of students at the
   university into the second year. Findings from the present study suggest
   that integrating at-risk students into a first-year seminar flipped
   classroom that matches student composition of the major benefits social
   integration and retention into the second year, for all students as well
   as those with low math scores.},

Abstract = {This study investigated the effect of the micro flipped method on
   English as a foreign language (EFL) learners' speaking fluency and
   compared its effect with the traditional face-to-face teacher-fronted
   method in the EFL context of Iran. To this end, 40 intermediate-level
   EFL learners in a language institute were selected through a placement
   test and were assigned to experimental and control groups. The control
   group (non-flipped classroom) was exposed to in-class activities and
   instructional materials in the print format whereas the experimental
   group (micro flipped classroom) was exposed to both in-class and
   out-of-class instructional materials, including mini videos uploaded
   before class via Edmodo, a technology-based pedagogical environment. To
   assess the participants' speaking fluency, they were interviewed at the
   beginning and end of their course, and the recorded speech data were
   analyzed through PRAAT (computer software package for speech analysis)
   in terms of six aspects of speaking fluency, including articulation rate
   (syllables per second), rate of all pauses, rate of long pauses, rate of
   unfilled and filled pauses and mean length of run. The analysis of the
   data through Mann-Whitney tests revealed statistically significant
   differences regarding the measures of fluency with the higher articulate
   rate and mean length of run and lower rates of pauses for the
   experimental group in the posttest interview. The findings accentuate
   the role of the flipped classroom and blended learning where
   second/foreign language (L2) leaners can develop their L2 speaking
   skills and fluency in online and actual settings.},

Abstract = {The aim of this research is to identify students' perception of the
   utilization of wikis, LINE, and flipped teaching strategies in a
   Research Methodology course at a university in Taiwan. Q-methodology, a
   combination of qualitative and quantitative research, was employed for
   this study, and sixteen participants were asked to rank-order 30
   statements related to the integration of wikis and LINE in a flipped
   classroom. Correlation, a centroid factor analysis, and judgmental
   rotation were used to identify the significant factors. The two factors
   that represented groups of participants with a similar perception were
   extracted and the results were as follows; (1) learners could be divided
   into those with a strong positive feeling about group-based activities
   and self-paced learning (Collaborative Achiever) and those who had a
   positive reaction to collaboration, but expressed concern about tension
   caused by competition (Collaborative Competitor), and (2) all the
   participants agreed that they were highly engaged and motivated when
   using Wikispaces and LINE in the flipped classroom based on the
   advantages of a timely and easy-to-use IT environment, self-regulated
   learning, virtual community companion, collaborative work, and the
   building and sharing of knowledge. The theoretical and practical
   implications of the results were discussed.},

Title = {Effectiveness of flipped classrooms in Chinese baccalaureate nursing
   education: A meta-analysis of randomized controlled trials},
Journal = {INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF NURSING STUDIES},

Abstract = {Background: In recent years, the flipped classroom approach has been
   broadly applied to nursing courses in China. However, a systematic and
   quantitative assessment of the outcomes of this approach has not been
   conducted.
   Objective: The purpose of the meta-analysis is to evaluate the
   effectiveness of the flipped classroom pedagogy in Chinese baccalaureate
   nursing education.
   Design: Meta-analysis of randomized controlled studies.
   Data source: All randomized controlled trials relevant to the use of
   flipped classrooms in Chinese nursing education were retrieved from the
   following databases from their date of inception through September 23,
   2017: PubMed, EMBASE, the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled
   Trials, CINAHL, the China National Knowledge Infrastructure, the Wanfang
   Database, and the Chinese Scientific Journals Database. Search terms
   including ``flipp{*}{''}, ``inverted{''}, ``classroom{''}, and
   ``nurs{*}{''} were used to identify potential studies. We also manually
   searched the reference lists of the retrieved articles to identify
   potentially relevant studies.
   Review methods: Two reviewers independently assessed the eligibility of
   each study and extracted the data. The Cochrane risk-of-bias tool was
   used to evaluate the quality of the studies. RevMan (Version 5.3) was
   used to analyze the data. Theoretical knowledge scores and skill scores
   (continuous data) were synthesized using the standardized mean
   difference (SMD) and 95\% confidence interval (CI). The statistical
   heterogeneity of the included studies was analyzed by calculating the 12
   statistic and applying a chi-square test. Publication bias was assessed
   by funnel plots. The quality of the combined results was evaluated using
   the Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development and Evaluation
   system.
   Results: Eleven randomized controlled trials published between 2015 and
   2017 were selected. All the included studies had a moderate possibility
   of bias due to low methodological quality. The meta-analysis indicated
   that the theoretical knowledge scores and skill scores were
   significantly higher in the flipped classroom group than in the
   traditional lectures group (SMD = 1.06, 95\% CI: 0.70-1.41, P < 0.001,
   and SMD = 1.40, 95\% CI: 0.46-2.34, P < 0.001). There was no significant
   publication bias indicated in the primary analysis. Sensitivity analysis
   showed that the results of our meta-analysis were reliable. The evidence
   grades of the results regarding the theoretical knowledge and skill
   scores were low and very low, respectively.
   Conclusion: Flipped classroom pedagogy is more effective than
   traditional lectures at improving students' theoretical knowledge and
   skill scores. Given the limitations of the included studies, more robust
   randomized controlled trials are warranted in a variety of educational
   settings to confirm our findings.},

Abstract = {The flipped classroom model is increasingly popular in higher education,
   due to a number of potential advantages. Students gain the ability to
   customize their learning by interacting with classroom concepts on their
   own schedule. By moving some content out of the classroom, instructors
   gain the ability to free up time for more active-learning exercises and
   to concentrate on higher-order levels of learning. This article
   describes a comprehensive curriculum for flipping an allied health
   microbiology course, including tips for video lecture content and for
   active-learning modules that can be used in the classroom.},

Abstract = {The ``flipped{''} classroom model is a new organizational design for the
   teaching and learning paradigm, as its name transmits, stands for the
   pedagogical switch of the traditional academic procedure as students'
   first contact with the subjects is made outside the ``four-wall
   classroom bounds{''}. Teachers' role is transposed into a kind of guide
   and facilitator, indicating the way to go, avoiding to walk in a
   parallel path, or even ahead, but indicating the way to go, motivating
   students in their own knowledge construction, letting them lead the way,
   following and supporting, constantly and carefully monitoring their
   learning outcomes. Classroom time is consumed with open discussions,
   solving tasks and application problems, clarifying the supporting
   fundaments, in order to improve students' engagement into their learning
   process in a collaborative environment. A flipped model was implemented
   into a Financial Mathematics Course at ISCAP and the sample of our study
   consisted of 803 students, enrolled in 2014, 2015 and 2016. The main
   purpose of this paper is to investigate how the incorporation of the
   flipped classroom model into a Financial Mathematics class, affected
   students' class training, learning, and achievement. The results
   obtained with this approach have shown a positive impact on students'
   achievement overall.},

Abstract = {Purpose To date, didactic lecturing is a common method of university
   medical training. However, higher levels of competence to solve complex
   issues are hardly to be achieved with a largely passive learning style.
   We established and evaluated a heutagogical blended learning concept to
   investigate self-determined learning with a multimedia-based,
   interactive approach in the lecture room to teach clinical radiology.
   Materials and Methods In the 2019/2020 winter semester, we included 266
   medical students in their fourth academic year in our prospective,
   observational study. Students participated in a series of 11
   radiological lectures given by 10 lecturers. They were requested to
   prepare for lectures by watching learning videos. During the lecture,
   students had to answer key-feature questions (KFQ) in small groups and
   to jointly submit their answers by means of an audience response system
   (ARS). After each lecture and the exam, we conducted surveys and
   compared results with a historical control group. A focus group
   interview with lecturers was performed after conclusion of the lecture
   series.
   Results The students' overall impression of the ``flipped classroom{''}
   concept and their examination grades were superior to historical
   controls (overall impression: 1.5 {[}95 \% CI 1.4-1.6] vs. 2.7 {[}95 \%
   CI 2.5-2.9] rated on a scale from 1 to 6, p < 0.001; examination grades:
   1.8 {[}95 \% CI 1.7-1.9] vs. 2.0 {[} 95 \% CI 1.9-2.0] rated on a scale
   from 1 to 5, p < 0.001). Most students agreed that learning videos (76.6
   \%), ARS ( 88.5 \%), KFQ (76.5 \%), and solution-oriented small group
   discussions (83.7 \%) were useful. Lecturers stated an improved
   convergence of demands on learning and clinical competence. However,
   they also emphasized an increased initial effort for implementation.
   Conclusion Students rated the overall benefit from the heutagogical
   ``flipped classroom{''} concept as high. Examination grades improved.
   According to lecturers, the ``flipped classroom{''} concept better
   matched later professional demands than traditional lectures.},

Abstract = {The concept of the clerkship at the Department of Oral and Maxillofacial
   Surgery was modified into a modern and sustainable teaching model with a
   flipped classroom approach. The aim was to prove whether these changes
   increased the students' learning success. For the preparation of the
   clerkship, an e-learning module with 10 chapters was established.
   Students were supposed to access one chapter ahead of each day's
   seminar. A test to assess the gain in knowledge was undertaken before
   and after participation in the clerkship. An evaluation took place after
   the test. The results of the test after the clerkship were significantly
   higher than before (p < 0.0001). The evaluation showed that the students
   were highly satisfied with the course in general, and the e-learning
   module specifically. In particular, the surgical videos helped them to
   better understand the operative steps. The clerkship at the Department
   of Oral and Maxillofacial Surgery was modified into a sustainable
   blended learning concept with a flipped classroom approach. With these
   developments, the ``flipped operating room{''} was shown to be effective
   in improving knowledge and competence among undergraduate dental
   students. (c) 2020 The British Association of Oral and Maxillofacial

Journal = {INTERACTIVE LEARNING ENVIRONMENTS},
Abstract = {With reference to the Technology-based Learning model for flipped
   classrooms, a literature review on Social Sciences Citation Index (SSCI)
   papers published in the Web of Science (WOS) database was conducted,
   with the application of flipped learning in science education as the
   research topic. The study analyzed the existing research on author
   nationalities, application domains, research methods, participants,
   learning strategies, and research issues. Based on the analysis data,
   starting from 2015, there have been a large number of flipped classroom
   studies in science education. The studies were mainly from the United
   States; the application domains were mostly chemistry, physics, biology,
   and natural science and ecology. Over half of the studies adopted
   quantitative methods, and participants were mainly college students. In
   the before-class stage, the flipped classroom studies in science
   education mainly adopted instructional videos as the learning materials
   and used online learning systems as the medium for materials and online
   discussion. In the in-class stage, the major learning strategy was
   problem-based learning, while over half of the studies did not employ
   educational technology. In the after-class stage, most studies
   administered examinations to explore the learning outcomes. Accordingly,
   Potential research issues are proposed as a reference for future
   studies.},

Abstract = {The aim of this research is to determine the impact of perceived
   Teachers' Digital Competence (TDC) on how well math teachers prepare the
   educational videos needed to put the flipped classroom model into
   practice. In preparing the videos, the teachers had to select
   pre-existing audiovisual material and then edit the content to adapt it
   to the flipped classroom. Described here is a non-experimental study of
   a sample of 50 teachers pursuing a Master's degree in Secondary School
   Math Education in Spain. This is a preliminary univariate descriptive
   study of the relationship between TDC and the quality of videos
   prepared. Possible correlations between these two variables and between
   the characteristics of the sample are also explored. In general, the
   teachers had an intermediate level of TDC and prepared satisfactory
   videos. Nevertheless, the videos were deficient in the sections related
   to their pedagogical and math instructional components. No correlation
   was observed between TDC and the quality of the videos prepared. These
   results indicate that the integration of technological, pedagogical, and
   math instructional components is more important for developing quality
   instructional videos than the technological component alone. Teacher
   training should incorporate elements which emphasize the application of
   technology to the pedagogical process of math instruction.},

Title = {The Flipped MOOC: Using Gamification and Learning Analytics in MOOC
   Design-A Conceptual Approach},
Journal = {EDUCATION SCIENCES},
Year = {2018},
Volume = {8},
Number = {1},
Month = {MAR},
Abstract = {Recently, research has highlighted the potential of Massive Open Online
   Courses (MOOCs) for education, as well as their drawbacks, which are
   well known. Several studies state that the main limitations of the MOOCs
   are low completion and high dropout rates of participants. However,
   MOOCs suffer also from the lack of participant engagement,
   personalization, and despite the fact that several formats and types of
   MOOCs are reported in the literature, the majority of them contain a
   considerable amount of content that is mainly presented in a video
   format. This is in contrast to the results reported in other educational
   settings, where engagement and active participation are identified as
   success factors. We present the results of a study that involved
   educational experts and learning scientists giving new and interesting
   insights towards the conceptualization of a new design approach, the
   flipped MOOC, applying the flipped classroom approach to the MOOCs'
   design and making use of gamification and learning analytics. We found
   important indications, applicable to the concept of a flipped MOOC,
   which entails turning MOOCs from mainly content-oriented delivery
   machines into personalized, interactive, and engaging learning
   environments. Our findings support the idea that MOOCs can be enriched
   by the orchestration of a flipped classroom approach in combination with
   the support of gamification and learning analytics.},

Title = {Implementing a Competency-Based Approach to Anatomy Teaching: Beginning
   With the End in Mind},
Journal = {JOURNAL OF MEDICAL EDUCATION AND CURRICULAR DEVELOPMENT},
Year = {2020},
Volume = {7},
Month = {FEB},
Abstract = {Background:
   The shift in the medical education system from a time-based to a
   competency-based model has encouraged its adoption and application in
   competency-based education in anatomy classrooms, such as team-based
   learning models and flipped classroom models. This pilot study aimed to
   build on previous work of the linkages between anatomy-based learning (a
   flipped classroom model inspired by a modified team-based learning) and
   student learning and engagement, and further to assess the linkage
   between anatomy-based learning and academic performance.
   Methods:
   A sequential mixed-methods design was employed to first gather and
   analyse quantitative data, including confidential student first semester
   scores in anatomy: gender, stream, anatomy-based learning, and final
   anatomy overall mark. The quantitative phase was followed by a
   qualitative phase in which a series of 8 anatomy laboratories were
   observed (4 anatomy-based learning and 4 traditional). Thematic analysis
   was performed on the observation data.
   Results:
   Aggregate anatomy-based learning and traditional stream tests, and final
   unit scores were compared. The anatomy-based learning and final unit
   scores showed little difference between students in the anatomy-based
   learning and students in the traditional stream. Students using
   anatomy-based learning had an aggregate score of 1.15 and final
   aggregate mark of 72, whereas students in the traditional section had an
   aggregate score of 1.19 and final mark of 79. Qualitative phase was
   undertaken to try to assess the linkages between anatomy-based learning
   and student learning. Observations showed that students in the
   anatomy-based learning section spent more time on task as compared with
   their peers in the traditional stream. The anatomy-based learning
   students also seemed to practice more self-directed learning and
   employed more multimodal learning strategies than the traditional
   section stream.
   Discussion/conclusions:
   Although the quantitative results of this study showed no significant
   difference in mean scores between anatomy-based learning and traditional
   designs, it was possible to observe the potential of flipped classroom
   model in engaging students in individual preparation, in team-based
   learning, and in consensus-based learning approaches.},

Abstract = {Purpose: Basic research about test-enhanced learning points towards its
   effectiveness to improve students' learning and is still underutilized
   in educational practice. Therefore, we developed an evidence-based
   instructional design to investigate the usefulness of test-enhanced
   learning within a flipped/inverted classroom approach. Materials and
   Methods: We developed two modes of learning material for the self-study
   phase of a flipped classroom for 139 students: in addition to
   educational films, one group of students received a reader and another
   group received multiple-choice questions that corresponded to the reader
   in content and length. An assessment of the content of the learning
   material was conducted at the subsequent on-site phase. Also, ratings
   about students' perceptions of the additional learning material were
   gathered. Results: At the assessment, students that prepared with films
   and multiple-choice questions outperformed students that prepared with
   films and the reader. Furthermore, students perceived the
   multiple-choice questions as more helpful, more motivating and felt
   better prepared for the assessment than students that used the reader.
   Conclusions: This study shows that test-enhanced learning can be
   utilized to promote students' learning within the self-study phase of a
   flipped classroom. Not only assessment scores are positively affected
   but also the motivation to learn and preparedness towards an assessment.},

Abstract = {This study aims to shed more light on our understanding of the learning
   consequences of an emerging pedagogical approach to teaching: the
   flipped classroom. This approach proposes a change of paradigm in which
   students are expected to assimilate concepts prior to attending classes
   with the objective of dedicating class time to the completion of
   activities that put those concepts into practice. Building on a sample
   of 219 undergraduate University students from Pablo de Olavide
   University enrolled on a course in Strategic Management, we compare
   students taught using a traditional teaching format (control group) with
   students taught using a flipped classroom format (experimental group).
   Our results show that the implementation of the flipped learning method
   has a significant impact on three important learning outcomes: (1) it
   increases the student's intrinsic motivation for the topic under study;
   (2) it results in higher exam grades; and (3) it reduces absenteeism.},

Abstract = {Engaging students in class when first-hand experience is not available
   is challenging. Three teaching strategies, flipped classroom, a guest
   speaker, and technology, engaged students during a global health class.
   Students were given a graded preclass assignment, which was used to
   guide the class session when an expert physician from Zambia joined us
   using technology. On the day of class, students were engaged and asked
   questions of the physician related to global health and culture.
   Combining the three strategies was an innovative and effective way to
   engage students, with many sharing with faculty that this was their
   favorite class day.},

Abstract = {The global Covid-19 pandemic caused havoc in higher education teaching
   routines and several residential institutions encouraged instructors to
   convert existing modules to flipped classrooms as part of an online,
   blended learning strategy. Even though this seems a reasonable request,
   instructors straightaway encountered challenges which include a vague
   concept of what an online flipped classroom entails within a higher
   education context, a lack of guidelines for converting an existing
   module, facilitating learner engagement as well as unique challenges for
   inclusion of all learners in a digitally divided developing country in
   Covid-19 lockdown. In order to respond, we embarked on a study to
   identify the distinguishing characteristics of flipped classrooms to
   understand the as-is and to-be scenarios using a systematic literature
   review. The characteristics were used to develop of design
   considerations to convert to an online flipped classroom for higher
   education taking our diverse learner profiles into account. We
   subsequently converted a short module in an information systems
   department and shortly report on our experience.},

Abstract = {The flipped classroom has become a popular pedagogical approach in
   higher education with its capability to promote students' active
   engagement in higher-order tasks; nevertheless, studies have shown that
   the flipped classroom is not always successful. The purpose of this
   study was to investigate factors including student characteristics as
   well as learning and teaching factors that influence students' affective
   and motivational outcomes in flipped classrooms in higher education. A
   total of 350 university students in 12 different flipped classrooms
   completed survey instruments at the end of the semester that assessed
   their experience with flipped classrooms, emotional experiences, and
   motivation. Results indicated that enjoyment was predicted by the
   perception of preview materials, teacher facilitation, and participation
   in learning activities. Boredom was predicted by the perception of
   preview materials and participation in learning activities.
   Self-efficacy was significantly explained by both student

Title = {Is the ``flipped{''} pedagogical model the answer to the challenges of

Journal = {NURSE EDUCATION TODAY},
Year = {2018},

Abstract = {Rural Australian health services face significant challenges such as
   aging populations, access and retention of services and health
   practitioners as well as difficulties with staff training due to
   geographic isolation. Educational pedagogy, through a `flipped' or
   `flipped' classroom method has become popular in nursing literature
   whereby discussion surrounding its effectiveness, ability to increase
   performance, address learning outcomes and resolve the
   education-clinical practice divide is currently being explored. Several
   reviews that look specifically at the validity and implementation of the
   flipped classroom pedagogy into nursing education demonstrate a need for
   further scientific research. Current literature examines the in-class on
   campus implementation of the methodology but rarely does it consider the
   advantages or ways of implementing such a method in a rural off campus
   nursing learning environment. The use of technology is not the solution
   unless supported by interaction to develop practical situational skills.
   The authors consider advantages and disadvantages and identify central
   problems for the effective implementation of `flipped' in off-campus
   rural nursing education.},

Abstract = {Conservative care, a comprehensive treatment path for advanced kidney
   disease most suitable for individuals unlikely to benefit from dialysis,
   is underutilized in the United States. One reason is an absence of
   robust education about this approach and how to discuss it with
   potential candidates. To address this need, we developed a multimodal
   conservative care curriculum for nephrology fellows. This curriculum
   consists of four online modules that address essential concepts and
   communication skills related to conservative care. It is followed by an
   in-person, interactive, ?flipped classroom? session facilitated by
   designated nephrology educators at participating Accreditation Council
   for Graduate Medical Education nephrology training programs. Curriculum
   effect was assessed using surveys completed by participating fellows
   immediately before and following the curriculum and for participating
   nephrology educators following flipped classroom teaching; 148
   nephrology trainees from 19 programs participated, with 108 completing
   both pre- and postcurriculum surveys. Mean self-reported preparedness
   (measured on a five-point Likert scale) increased significantly for all
   ten concepts taught in the curriculum. The mean correct score on eight
   knowledge questions increased from 69\% to 82\% following the curriculum
   ( P <0.001). Fellows rated the curriculum highly and reported that they
   plan to practice skills learned. For the 19 nephrology program
   educators, the mean perceived preparedness to teach all curriculum
   domains increased after, compared with before, facilitating the flipped
   classroom, reaching significance for seven of the ten concepts measured.
   Data suggest that fellows' participation in a multimodal curriculum
   increased knowledge and preparation for fundamental conservative care
   concepts and communication skills. Fellows rated the curriculum highly.
   Educator participation appears to have increased preparedness for
   teaching the curriculum concepts, making it likely that future education
   in conservative care will become more widespread. Herein, we describe
   the curriculum content, which we have made publicly available in order
   to encourage broader implementation, and its effect on participating
   fellows and the nephrology educators who facilitated it.},

Abstract = {Objectives/Hypothesis To examine the perspectives of current
   otolaryngology-head and neck surgery residents and faculty members on
   educational formats and approaches. To assess the effects of a novel
   integrative educational curriculum for residents by examining results
   from the otolaryngology training examination (OTE). We hypothesized that
   altering the current curriculum to accentuate resident participation
   would result in improved performance on the OTE.
   Study Design Prospective cohort study.
   Methods We conducted a study from June 2015 to July 2018. All faculty
   attendings and residents were asked to participate in the study and were
   included. A novel educational curriculum founded on the principles of
   experiential learning and utilizing the PulseQD app to facilitate
   collaborative learning was implemented. The results of a questionnaire
   distributed within the department and yearly OTE scores were collected.
   Results Residents and faculty attendings reported comparable exposure to
   educational formats throughout their training, although residents had
   more experience with flipped classroom settings. Both groups had similar
   attitudes toward the importance and effectiveness of educational
   opportunities. There was a statistically significant improvement in OTE
   scores in each of the 2 years after implementation of the educational
   changes (P = .0296 and P = .00237, respectively), with all current
   residents improving their scores on the most recent OTE.
   Conclusions Through implementation of this integrative educational
   curriculum our residents showed significant improvement in OTE scores.
   Our results suggest that this type of curriculum, which combines a
   variety of approaches including a flipped classroom model with active
   participation and integrates app technology, can improve resident
   performance on educational assessments.

Title = {Knowledge, skills and barriers to evidence-based practice and the impact
   of a flipped classroom training program for physical therapists: An
   observational study},
Journal = {PHYSIOTHERAPY THEORY AND PRACTICE},
Abstract = {Objective To evaluate the knowledge, skills and barriers to
   evidence-based practice and the impact of evidence-based practice
   training for physical therapy clinicians. Methods Physical therapists
   from a health district in Sydney, Australia were invited to participate.
   The primary outcome was the Assessing Competency in Evidence-based
   Medicine scale (range 0-15; 15 is high knowledge and skill) to quantify
   knowledge and skills. The secondary outcomes were the four subscales of
   the BARRIERS scale (range 1-4; 4 is high barrier) to quantify barriers.
   Outcomes were collected at baseline and post an evidence-based practice
   training program (flipped classroom approach that addressed the core
   competencies for teaching evidence-based practice) of 3 months duration.
   Registration: Australian and New Zealand Clinical Trial Register
   (ACTRN12619000038190). Results 104 participants completed baseline data
   and 94 completed post-training data. The mean score for the Assessing
   Competency in Evidence-based Medicine scale for knowledge and skills at
   baseline was 9.5 (standard deviation 1.6). The mean BARRIERS subscale
   scores at baseline were: Healthcare Provider 1.9 (0.5); Research 2.2
   (0.5); Setting 2.6 (0.5); and Presentation 2.6 (0.5). On average,
   training increased the Assessing Competency in Evidence-based Medicine
   scale score by 0.1 points (95\% confidence interval -0.2 to 0.5) and
   reduced barriers by -0.1 (-0.2 to 0.0; Setting subscale) to -0.2 (-0.3
   to -0.1; Healthcare Provider subscale). Conclusions Physical therapists
   have knowledge and skill in evidence-based practice that is comparable
   to other allied health professionals, medical students and medical
   doctors, and encountered barriers to using high-quality clinical
   research to guide practice. Training did not change knowledge and skills
   but did reduce barriers.},

Abstract = {The old-style pattern of instruction has been to allocate students to
   read textbooks and work on assigned problems outside of school, while
   listening to lectures and taking exams in class. With the introduction
   of Flipped instruction or a flipped classroom the students absorb new
   content online by watching video lectures, usually at home, and what
   used to be homework is now done in class with teachers offering more
   tailored direction and communication with students, instead of
   lecturing. Up to fifty percent of the course, content was flipped in
   this study. Results on six of the courses used will be presented and
   deliberated on.},

Abstract = {Twenty-first-century skills are considered to be critical to student
   development. The present study aimed to validate a scale that reflects
   21(st) century skills in education. The participants were 982 students
   in the fourth, fifth, and sixth grades at two primary schools in a large
   city in Shandong, China, who were all asked to learn English in a
   flipped classroom. This 5-point Likert scale assessed students'
   collaboration, creation, self-regulation, interest, and engagement in
   English as a foreign language (EFL) flipped classrooms in China.
   Exploratory factor analysis (EFA) and confirmatory factor analysis (CFA)
   were adopted in this study. The EFA results demonstrated that the scale
   contains five dimensions with good indicators. Good model fits derived
   from CFA supported the five-dimension structure. Further analysis
   revealed that there were positive correlations between this scale and
   the other two scales: the Learning Self-efficacy and Adolescent Student
   Burnout Inventory scales, indicating that convergent validity was
   achieved. These findings confirmed that this scale is a reliable and
   valid tool for measuring 21(st) century key skills in EFL flipped
   classroom in China and may supplement the limitations of traditional
   teaching evaluations. In future studies, researchers may extend its use
   in other disciplines by examining its reliability and validity.},

Title = {The ``flipped-hybrid{''} classroom: A didactic technique for teaching
   foreign languages},
Journal = {E-MENTOR},
Year = {2018},
Number = {2},
Pages = {73-77},
Abstract = {The objective of this investigation is to determine if the `flipped{''}
   model can be combined with hybrid learning as to create the
   `flipped-hybrid{''} classroom. The flipped classroom refers to an
   educational model where the traditional practice of dedicating class
   time to direct instruction is inverted so that students receive initial
   content instruction at home. In addition to this, students in this
   study's `flipped hybrid{''} classroom participated in synchronous online
   conversations with native speakers and engaged in pre-class activities,
   thus making a significant component of the course online. The
   participants in this study included college level Spanish students and
   lasted the duration of the spring 2017 semester. Results from this pilot
   study suggest that the `flippedhybrid{''} technique is a viable
   alternative to the traditional classroom, provides students with
   additional opportunities to use the language in authentic situations,
   and encourages more spontaneous language use. A detailed description of
   the `flipped-hybrid{''} classroom and how it differs from a hybrid or a
   flipped classroom is included, as well as pedagogical implications.},

Abstract = {BackgroundThe acting (Sub)internship (AI) provides fourth-year medical
   students the opportunity to gain essential clinical experience, making
   it challenging to develop an effective curriculum without detracting
   from clinical time.ActivityThis flipped classroom, asynchronous learning
   curriculum utilized a short online video, called a micro-lecture, to
   teach one to two key concepts, associated with online case-based
   questions.Results and DiscussionOver one academic year, 96\% (64/67) of
   internal medicine AI students at our institution completed the online
   questions. The majority of students selected the single best response
   for both questions and preferred this online micro-lecture format over
   traditional methods.},

Abstract = {Radioanalitical techniques are singular spectroscopic techniques briefly
   or not at all presented in the analytical instrumentation courses. The
   use of active teaching techniques could contribute to amend this
   situation by motivating students to take these radiochemical courses
   where these active techniques are used. Therefore, the objective of this
   article is to present two strategies for radioanalytical techniques
   teaching. The first one, flipped classroom, introduces an article
   reading using a guide for teaching the radioanalytical techniques. The
   second strategy, case study, uses the determination of K-40 in bananas
   by its different emissions, for teaching the different aspects of the
   subject.},

Abstract = {In recent times the use of flipped classrooms in tertiary education has
   become more prevalent. This article considers the implementation of a
   flipped classroom structure to deliver Taxation Law at the University of
   Western Australia. The Taxation Law unit is a core subject in the
   Business Law major with over 150 students. The unit examines the basic
   concepts and fundamentals of Australian taxation law. Delivery of the
   unit was changed from a traditional lecture and tutorial model to a
   blended learning or flipped classroom. The current delivery mode
   includes a combination of short videos, online reading materials, online
   learning activities, and in-person workshops and tutorials. This article
   identifies why and how change was implemented and the pedagogical theory
   underlying the change in delivery mode, and discusses the effectiveness
   of the change using an action research design. In particular, the
   article will examine key risks in developing and implementing this type
   of delivery mode, along with quantitative and qualitative data to
   highlight changes in student perceptions, student motivation and
   engagement, student achievement, and teacher perceptions.},

Abstract = {The study suggests broadening the taxonomy of MOOC models and provides
   evidence for the prevalence of Small Private Online Courses (SPOC) among
   open education models in the post-MOOC era. A systemic literature
   review1 is performed to analyze research publications of 2013-2018 on
   using SPOCs in European university education. It has been found that
   SPOCs combine well with formal university education in European
   Bachelor's degree programs when using pedagogical models like blended
   learning, flipped classroom and collaborative learning. We recommend
   spreading SPOC practices in Russian higher education to improve the
   learning motivation of students.},

Abstract = {Objective. To implement and assess the impact of a hybrid
   flipped-classroom activity designed to increase the motivation and
   confidence of Doctor of Pharmacy (PharmD) students in addressing the
   opioid crisis.
   Methods. Third-professional year student pharmacists were provided with
   reading material developed by federal agencies and professional pharmacy
   organizations, as well as Georgia-specific information covering medical
   amnesty and local resources for opioid-overdose prevention prior to
   class. They then attended a four-hour classroom session that included
   hearing a lecture on opioid pharmacology and opioid overdose, viewing
   training videos, and engaging in extensive discussion. The students
   voluntarily completed pre- and post-intervention assessments regarding
   opioid abuse and opioid overdose prevention.
   Results. Seventy of the 107 third-year students enrolled in the course
   completed the pre-intervention assessment (65\% response rate), and 33
   of the 70 completed the post-intervention assessment (47\% retention
   rate). The students exhibited a high baseline motivation to assist in
   combating the opioid crises, but less confidence in their ability to
   intervene. Significant increases were seen in areas related to student
   confidence on the post-intervention assessment. Fewer changes were seen
   in areas related to student motivation.
   Conclusion. A ``hybrid{''} flipped classroom activity increased the
   confidence of student pharmacists in their understanding of the physical
   and adverse effects of opioids and the application of reversal agents.
   Increased confidence may support increased intervention.},

Abstract = {The aim of this study was to evaluate the effectiveness of a blended
   learning model with a flipped classroom approach in a clinical dental
   education setting based on student performance and perceptions.
   Comparisons were made between blended learning and traditional methods
   for all fourth-year dental students in two consecutive cohorts in a
   conservative dentistry course at a dental school in Jordan. The 2016-17
   cohort (control group) consisted of 364 students taught with
   conventional methods. The 2017-18 cohort (study group) consisted of 253
   students taught with blended learning using a flipped classroom method.
   Performance measures were two exams (online and written), two
   assignments, inclinic quizzes, and clinical assessment. The study also
   assessed the number of posts made by students in the study group on an
   online discussion forum. The results showed that the study group
   students had significantly better performance on all assessments than
   the control group students. The students' overall grades in the blended
   learning cohort were an average 7.25 points higher than in the control
   cohort. Students who participated in the online forum also had better
   performance in the course: one participation correlated with 0.697
   standard deviations higher score. Overall, students' perceptions were
   positive and supported the adoption of a blended learning model in the
   course. These results showing improved student performance provide
   support for blended learning and use of an online discussion forum.},

Abstract = {Universiti Teknologi MARA Perlis Branch (UiTM Perlis) faced a huge
   challenge in teaching and learning for the subject Fundamentals of
   Entrepreneurship (ENT300/ETR300). This subject is classified as a
   university's code; therefore every diploma student in UiTM must enroll
   for the subject. The enrollment for ENT300/ETR300 increased from 570
   students (semester 2012) to a maximum of 1,384 students (semester 2013).
   Thus, it leads to various weaknesses such as insufficient instructors,
   complexities in conducting student assessments, as well as limited
   facilities available in the university. Because of this, i-CREATE was
   designed to address these issues. Using this strategy, the process of
   teaching and learning for ENT300/ETR300 has been innovated. This method
   provides benefits to various parties including students, instructors,
   faculty members, and university.},

Abstract = {In this article, we present a study focusing on the learning experiences
   of business students in an organizational and marketing communication
   course. The pedagogical approaches of a flipped classroom, collaborative
   inquiry, and communication in the disciplines guided the planning of the
   course. A mixed-methods approach was used. The key findings include
   positive student evaluations of the pedagogies utilized. Moreover, a
   wide variety of learning outcomes was reported, particularly in the
   fields of crisis communication and workplace communication. The
   pedagogies utilized enabled a comprehensive model for teaching
   communication and contributed to relevant learning experiences and skill
   development for the 21st century.},

Abstract = {The flipped classroom (where students prepare before and then develop
   understanding during class) and technology-enhanced learning
   (audio-visual learning tools) are increasingly used to supplement
   anatomy teaching. However, the supporting literature lacks robust
   methodology and is conflicting in demonstrating efficacy outcomes.
   Contrastingly, near-peer teaching (where senior students teach juniors
   on the same academic programme) is well researched and reported to be
   both effective and versatile. This provides an ideal vehicle in which to
   investigate and potentially optimise these approaches.
   This study aims to assess educational impact of the peer-led flipped
   model and student engagement and perceptions regarding traditional and
   TEL resources.
   A quasi-randomised, cross-sectional study was conducted with 281
   second-year University of Southampton medical students. Students were
   randomly allocated to 3 groups: traditional lecture (control), flipped
   text resource, or flipped video resource. The first group received no
   pre-teaching material, but the flipped groups received a text or video
   pre-teaching resource. Objective outcomes measured were:
   Knowledge gain and retention via multiple-choice questionnaires and
   formative exams
   Student perceptions and engagement using questionnaires and 2 focus
   groups
   All groups demonstrated significant knowledge gain post-teaching (p <
   0.0001). However, regardless of engagement with pre-teaching material,
   no significant difference was found in knowledge gain or retention
   between the groups. Students engaged 21.1\% more with the text rather
   than video resource (p = 0.0019), but spent equal time using both (p =
   0.0948). All resources and teaching approaches were perceived `very
   useful' with no significant differences found between groups. A
   qualitative approach utilising thematic analysis of focus groups
   identified 4 themes, including `Attitudes towards flipped classroom',
   which revealed mixed reviews and perceptions from participants.
   This study has found the peer-led flipped model is of no detriment to
   educational impact compared to peer-led traditional approaches in a
   well-established peer teaching programme in undergraduate medicine at
   the University of Southampton. Students value traditional and video
   resources but engage with them differently. Additionally, it was
   reported that in this experiment, NPT did not seem well suited to the
   flipped classroom, suggesting a rare limitation of the utility of NPT
   application within an anatomy curriculum.},

Abstract = {The Universidad Catolica de Temuco (Araucania region, Chile) has
   experienced substantial changes in recent years: today, young people
   with a poor academic background, who are also digital natives, are
   enrolled in it. In this scenario, fostering deep learning in all
   students, the teachers have been given the task of implementing active
   learning methodologies with ICT incorporation. Specifically, the faculty
   that teaches ``Chemistry in Context{''} to engineering students decided
   to transform (re-design) of this course, which included the
   implementation of active learning strategies such as the flipped
   classroom, instead of traditional lectures, and guided inquiry to change
   the laboratory work. This article explains how the new strategies were
   implemented, and it shows results which were obtained by contrasting
   students' performance (based on the grades) before and after the
   transformation process. After the transformation, the approval rate
   nearly doubled and the dropout rate reduced from 40\% to 17\% in 2017.
   In the case of the laboratory work, although the tasks were more complex
   guided inquiry showed much better grades. These results can be
   attributed to the students working to build their learning, to the fact
   that the laboratory grade had a more significant percentage of the final
   grade and to the fact that students had to do all the experimental work
   as a mandatory activity otherwise they would fail the course. It was
   found that the flipped classroom will be successful if students value
   autonomous work and act accordingly.},

Abstract = {The flipped classroom is proposed as an answer to challenges in higher
   education. However, studies that explore its influence on first-year
   student motivation are largely lacking. Using the self-determination
   theory, this study examines the influence oflarge-scale flipped
   lectures, here called `expert labs', on first-year student motivation in
   the context of a health sciences course (n = 219 students). A
   mixed-method approach was used, including questionnaires and focus
   groups with students and tutors. Paper-and-pencil surveys included
   questionnaires based on the Basic Personal Needs Satisfaction and
   Frustration Scale to compare student motivation in both traditional
   lectures and expert labs. Focus groups explored student's and teacher's
   experiences in relation to strengths and points for improvement of the
   flipped classroom. Results suggest thata large-scale flipped
   settingoffers a possibility to enhance the relatedness of first-year
   students through increased interaction and in-class group assignments.
   First-year students appreciate the flexibility of pre-lecture
   preparation and an increased understanding of content through active
   application and peer learning. Nonetheless, first-year students indicate
   a need for guidance in pre-lecture preparation, explicit expectation
   management, and possibly the addition of external incentives to be
   motivated. When designing a large-scale flipped course, the challenge
   remains to tailor a blended course to support first-year student
   motivation by, for example, combining teacher support, scaffolding, and
   an autonomy supporting environment.},

Abstract = {The present study responds to a descriptive research of a bibliographic
   review type, which had the objective of analyzing the active
   methodologies conducive to the teaching of Social Sciences in Basic
   General Education. The scientific research methods used were:
   documentary review, content analysis, hermeneutical and
   analytic-synthetic. Among the main considerations, the benefit of active
   methodologies in the teaching of Social Sciences stands out. The flipped
   classroom and gamification as active methods mobilize cognitive
   structures towards the acquisition of new knowledge, incorporating it in
   a fast and lasting way. These methods support active strategies and
   methodologies in a constructivist context aimed at achieving meaningful
   learning as a contribution to the development of creativity, reflection,
   argumentation, criticality and cognitive independence.},

Abstract = {This paper reports on a study aiming at examining the development of
   science process skills through the implementation of experiments in a
   science course which was performed in flipped classroom design. Flipped
   classroom model was implemented for a series of experimentation
   activities in a science classroom in which 38 science teacher candidates
   were enrolled. Both quantitative and qualitative data were used to
   acquire a better understanding of the improvement in science process
   skills. A test of Integrated Process Skills, participants' experiment
   plans and interviews were used as data gathering tools. The results
   indicated that flipped learning in the experimentation process
   positively influenced especially identifying and stating hypotheses and
   operationally defining science process skills. It was observed that the
   provision of the required prior conceptual and procedural knowledge via
   watching videos as out of-school activities was an effective way in
   flipping the experimentation process. The affordances of videos and the
   guidance of the instructor played a key role on the teacher candidates'
   laboratory oriented learning journey. Along with the results, some
   implications were provided for flipping the courses including such
   practical sessions as experiments.},

Abstract = {This research proposes a pedagogic practice to increase dynamic
   independent student participation and engagement through the lens of the
   flipped classroom, promoting the understanding of learning as a cyclical
   process of the Revised Bloom's Taxonomy. With recommendations that may
   support hybrid delivery of actor training delivered both face to face
   and via online platforms, this paper considers the student learning
   experience of approaching rehearsals when preparing for a role within
   the UK actor training conservatoire by applying an overview of the
   methodologies of two key practitioners to this framework. The
   publications in the English translation of the practitioners
   Stanislavski and Hagen have been used, to ensure that as authentic a
   voice as possible is examined.},

Abstract = {It is always a big problem to explain students what radiation is and how
   it can help researchers in understanding the structure of materials in a
   clear and simple way. The exact comprehension of radiation has followed
   a very problematic historical excursus. The problem of understanding
   what light is started to be faced around the VI century B.C.; since that
   time, a continuous development of ideas and models has characterized the
   definition of radiation. After Maxwell's equation, the behaviour of
   light seemed to be well understood, although further enriched,
   afterwards, by the discoveries in quantum mechanics. Radiation can give
   rise to several phenomena when interacting with matter. Thus with a
   correct comprehension of its origin, radiation can constitute a powerful
   tool in modern science to probe the structure of materials down to the
   nano-scale and even lower. In this work, scattering phenomena will be
   considered as effective examples to propose to young students for
   probing the structure of materials, since these are usually
   characterized by hierarchical organization of self-assembled structures
   at different length scales, from atomic to macroscopic distances. In
   this complex framework, the concept of characteristic distances is
   pivotal in defining the structure of a material, and can be easily
   derived from scattering experiments. In this respect, the efforts made
   in the last century to understand the origin of radiation turned out to
   be useful in giving researchers the best tool to characterize a given
   material, at least from its structural point of view. For this reason,
   modern didactics must take into account for modern approaches to make
   people aware of these aspects. If bringing kids and young students
   closer to these arguments is easily achieved by a ``learn by doing{''}
   approach, this work, structured from the historical point of view and
   reporting tickling aspects of the debates taken place among peoples over
   the centuries, represents an opportunity for an interdisciplinary
   flipped classroom approach.},

Abstract = {Flipped classrooms are an instructional strategy that is becoming
   popular in educational contexts, particularly higher education. The
   principle of Flipped Classroom is that events that have traditionally
   taken place inside the classroom now take place outside the classroom
   and vice versa. Various studies have reported increased student
   performance and satisfaction after switching to a flipped classroom.
   However, most of these studies are based on students' perceptions of
   their own learning, not based on teachers' assessment of students'
   achievements. This article presents the results of flipping a computer
   programming course. It first describes how this course was flipped, then
   it presents the results of comparing the average marks awarded to
   students between those that took the course offering in flipped mode and
   those that took the course in the traditional mode. The comparison
   showed an increase in student performance in a flipped mode.
   Furthermore, the increase in student performance was sustained for 3
   years, which is the full duration of this study. The comparison of
   student satisfaction showed an increase in student satisfaction in one
   campus, while the student satisfaction remained steady in another
   campus.},

Abstract = {The study analysed the impact of the flipped classroom (FC) approach on
   weaving experience, self-efficacy and students' learning achievement. To
   achieve this purpose, a quasi-experimental (pre-test/post-test) design,
   with a control group and an experimental group, was implemented. A mixed
   methods approach was used to evaluate the outcomes of the intervention.
   Forty- four first year senior high school students of an elective
   textile education subject participated in the study. An academic
   achievement test and a semi-structured group interview were employed as
   data-gathering instruments. Descriptive and inferential statistics
   (parametric and nonparametric tests), as well as thematic analysis were
   used to analyse the data collected. Findings of the study indicated
   that, regarding the acquisition of skill set and the maintenance of
   academic achievement, the students in the treatment group taught using
   the FC approach obtained higher levels of achievement juxtaposed with
   the students in the control group tutored with a traditional
   teacher-centred approach. The study further established that a
   flipped-classroom approach was engaging, interactive and exciting for
   students. The students in the experimental group, via the qualitative
   inquiry, expressed satisfaction with the practice in weaving and felt
   elevated in their knowledge, attitudes, self-learning, problem-solving
   and critical thinking skills acquisition. Therefore, the study
   recommended that the school adopt the FC approach as a method of
   teaching studio-based Visual Art subjects to support instructional
   hours.},

Title = {Johnstone's Triangle as a Pedagogical Framework for Flipped-Class
   Instructional Videos in Introductory Chemistry},

Abstract = {A growing body of educational research is demonstrating the improvements
   to learning gains and student performance that can be promoted by a
   flipped-classroom model in university chemistry courses. Usually, a core
   aspect of the flipped-class model is the student viewing of a preclass
   instructional video, allotting time for an in-class activity during the
   following lecture. Flipped-classroom instructional videos were prepared
   for a first-year general chemistry course at the University of British
   Columbia's Okanagan campus. Unlike many flipped-class video resources,
   these videos are not just narrated screen captures. Instead, they are
   anchored in live instructor recordings, complemented by three different
   presentation modes, each designed for pedagogical correspondence to a
   corner of Johnstone's triangle: narrated screen capture (symbolic),
   molecular animations (submicroscopic), and experimental laboratory
   demonstrations (macroscopic). Live instructor recording created a
   reliable persona for students to interact with, in keeping with tenets
   of social agency theory, and video format and design were informed by
   principles of cognitive load theory. Student responses to these videos
   and the associated flipped-class modules were assessed by using a mixed
   method approach. Semistructured interviews provided detailed student
   feedback regarding both student satisfaction and pedagogical utility.
   Quiz data assessing pre- and postvideo knowledge and student survey data
   on attitudes toward the flipped-class modules were also collected.
   Statistical analyses and coded interview data indicated general
   appreciation and higher satisfaction with flipped-classroom modules
   compared to traditional lectures, matched by a general student belief
   that the flipped modules enhanced their learning. Students feel that
   interactive questions embedded in the videos and the video segments
   aligned with the Johnstone's triangle framework contributed positively
   to their conceptual understanding, while the humor and enthusiastic tone
   provided by live-footage instructor segments promotes both viewer
   engagement and trust in the authenticity of the instructional material.},

Abstract = {Flipped classrooms provide students the opportunity to collaboratively
   solve challenging problems in class with help and scaffolding available
   from instructors. Because there are many ways to structure a flipped
   course, research on the effectiveness of flipping classrooms has
   produced mixed results. Therefore, it is important for researchers to
   describe the class structure when evaluating the flipped classroom
   format. This enables other instructors to determine which approach is
   best suited to their particular teaching style. The current paper
   describes and evaluates the use of existing open-source (stand-alone)
   videos when flipping an introductory physics classroom. Over 4 years,
   data was gathered via three methods including a survey measuring
   self-reported student perceptions of the course (n = 48), performance on
   a concept inventory (n = 113), and institutional records (n = 298) to
   provide a holistic view of the effects of flipping the class. Results
   indicated that students regularly watched and took notes on the videos,
   but not all the students enjoyed the flipped classroom format. Despite
   fewer topics being covered in the flipped version of the class, there
   were no statistically significant differences in concept inventory
   performance before and after the course was flipped. Students had higher
   grades in the associated laboratory course and in subsequent
   quantitative reasoning courses after the course was flipped. There were
   no statistically significant differences between grades in subsequent
   physics courses or based on gender after the course was flipped.
   Additional implications of the study are also presented.},

Title = {Student Preclass Preparation by Both Reading the Textbook and Watching
   Videos Online Improves Exam Performance in a Partially Flipped Course},

Abstract = {The flipped classroom has the potential to improve student performance.
   Because flipping involves both preclass preparation and problem solving
   in the classroom, the means by which increased learning occurs and
   whether the method of delivering content matters is of interest. In a
   partially flipped cell biology course, students were assigned online
   videos before the flipped class and textbook reading before lectures.
   Low-stakes assessments were used to incentivize both types of preclass
   preparation. We hypothesized that more students would watch the videos
   than read the textbook and that both types of preparation would
   positively affect exam performance. A multiple linear regression
   analysis showed that both reading and video viewing had a significant
   positive impact on exam score, and this model was predictive of exam
   scores. In contrast to our expectations, most students prepared by both
   watching videos and reading the textbook and did not exhibit a pattern
   of solely watching videos. This analysis supports previous findings that
   engagement with material outside class is partly responsible for the
   improved outcomes in a flipped classroom and shows that both reading and
   watching videos are effective at delivering content outside class.},

Title = {Parents involvement in elementary schools learning through flipped
   classrooms in indonesia},
Journal = {EDUCATION 3-13},
Abstract = {A learning model that provides space for parents through flipped
   classrooms at the elementary school level was developed based on the
   results of field studies and literature studies. The model is
   implemented and the results are compared with a flipped classroom
   without parental involvement. Many participants were involved consisting
   of teachers, parents, and students from public and private schools. The
   competence and character of students in the learning group that involves
   parents are better than the learning group without parental involvement.
   The group of participants in the learning involving parents generally
   showed positive attitudes and perceptions towards the implemented
   learning model. However, to ensure a more appropriate form of practice
   based on various parental backgrounds, further studies are needed.},

Abstract = {Lifelong learning is essential for the practicing cardiologist. Present
   lifelong learning mechanisms are stagnant and at risk for not meeting
   the needs of currently practicing cardiologists. With the increasing
   burden of cardiovascular disease, growing complexity of patient care,
   and ongoing pressures of nonclinical responsibilities, educational
   programming must evolve to meet the demands of the contemporary
   cardiovascular professional. A paradigm shift, replete with modern and
   practical educational tools, is needed in the lifelong learning
   armamentarium. Emerging evidence of novel educational strategies in
   graduate medical education supports the promise of broader application
   of these tools to different stages of professional life. In this
   commentary from the Fellows-in-Training Section Leadership Council, the

Abstract = {A cyber-flipped course was conducted with the flipped classroom pedagogy
   by using a wholly online approach for all learning activities in
   asynchronous and synchronous class sessions. Literature suggests that
   traditional flipped courses can effectively enhance students' learning
   outcomes in comparison to non-flipped courses. However, conducting all
   asynchronous and synchronous learning activities using a wholly online
   approach has not been reported. This paper aimed to investigate how
   student engagement in four different types of learning activities
   affects their learning outcomes in a cyber-flipped course. Results show
   that the learning activities with the flipped classroom pedagogy can be
   successfully implemented and conducted in a wholly online course along
   with time and space flexibility for learners. This study also found that
   students who watched more pre-recorded video lectures tended to
   participate in the synchronous learning activities more actively and
   obtained a higher semester grade; higher completion of asynchronous
   learning activities had benefited students' understanding of the
   learning concepts. Furthermore, students who had a high level of
   readiness by attending synchronous class sessions on time and keeping
   their webcams activated had more frequent and proactive interactions
   with their peers and instructor.},

Abstract = {The use of flipped-classroom methodology (FC) has increased recently,
   however, there is a lack of quantitative data on students' performance.
   A FC has been applied into a group (80 students) of an obligatory
   subject of the 2nd course in an Energetic Engineering Bachelor. A second
   group has been taught with the traditional methodology (72 students) to
   compare the results. The FC requires students to obtain background
   knowledge prior to a face-to face class meeting, and reserves in-class
   time for applying knowledge to solve problems. This is the opposite of
   the traditional lecture-based classroom, in which students passively
   attend didactic lectures from the instructor, then study the content and
   complete assignments after class. The main objectives of this research
   were to measure the impact of learning (with special attention to really
   active students), reduce absenteeism, increase exam attendance, and
   analyze how participating students view their experience with this
   methodology. The results show that the flipped-classroom model has a
   direct impact on student learning (or grades), especially in students
   with a high degree of involvement (with grades about 1.5 points higher).
   In addition, the grades standard deviation values were lower (in about
   one point), ensuring a better general students level. The students are a
   little reluctant to this new methodology, but thanks to it, they tend to
   work more (12\% of the students work more hours per week), to attend
   more to class (at least 10\% more), and to attend in a higher ratio to
   exams (around 20\%).},

Abstract = {The heart of design studio teaching is traditionally linked to
   one-on-one teaching activities and to the exchange of feedback prompting
   many design educators to think it does not lend itself to online
   delivery. This study explored how design educators can translate the
   essence of design studio pedagogy into a blended learning environment.
   The four-year study involving 119 first-year undergraduate design
   students reports on the development, implementation, and iteration of a
   blended learning experience in an introductory design subject. The
   subject followed a flipped classroom model where video lectures,
   software tutorials, and additional readings were delivered online
   through a Learning Management System; practical face-to-face tutorials
   allowed students to work on their projects, present their work, and
   engage in the dialogical learning process. Student and design instructor
   feedback was collected to evaluate the changes and overall effectiveness
   of the design of the blended learning experience, which proved to be
   effective.},

Abstract = {In higher education, it is usual to separate the theoretical contents
   from the practical ones and use teacher-centered methodologies. This
   fact makes students lose motivation due to the lack of connection with
   real professional tasks. Conversely, student-centered learning methods,
   such as project-based learning (PBL) or flipped classroom, aim to
   integrate both theoretical and practical contents and to apply them on
   real-world problems, thus increasing the students' motivation and
   involvement. These methodologies are usually applied in the last years
   of a degree, but it is difficult to find them in basic first-year
   subjects. The aim of this paper consists in assessing the application of
   a PBL methodology in the first-year subjects of computer engineering.
   This methodological change aims to achieve a significant improvement in
   the students' learning achievement of the core subject computer
   fundamentals. The project involved in the PBL proposal consists of
   developing a portable calculator. The performance of the PBL group is
   compared with that of other groups with a traditional, teacher-centered
   learning system. The evolution of the knowledge acquisition is
   determined by means of an initial evaluation and a final assessment
   after developing the project. An exhaustive statistical analysis is
   performed so as to evaluate the PBL application. Quantitative results
   show a significant improvement in the experimental group marks, which
   increased by up to 20\% compared to the control groups. As a conclusion,
   applying PBL and flipped classroom engaged students within the subject,
   thus achieving a deeper understanding of its theoretical concepts.},

Abstract = {Students who have to retake courses at university are often not only low
   achieving, but also unmotivated and lacking in self-confidence. In this
   study, we present the first report of a teaching strategy based on the
   implementation of the flipped classroom model, team-based learning, and
   frequent testing strategies in groups of students retaking a subject. A
   sample of seven groups of an average of 68 students followed the new
   teaching approach. The groups are distributed across four subjects and
   three semesters. By comparing the average performance across groups that
   apply different teaching strategies - traditional versus innovative - we
   find a significant increase in the academic performance of the students
   following the new approach.},

Abstract = {An investigation of teacher and student use of digital devices and tools
   to inform others about ways to create twenty-first-century digital
   learning experiences in the classroom and at home. The researchers used
   a qualitative research design to elicit teacher perceptions and use of
   1:1 (device to student) and 1:2 digital devices and tools through survey
   data from third, fourth, and fifth-grade teachers who were a part of a
   digital learning pilot in a large public-school district in the
   Southeastern United States. Teachers used station rotation, individual
   rotation, and flipped classroom models of blended learning to
   differentiate instruction and provide digital learning experiences to
   their students. Teacher-selected digital tools allowed students to use
   multiple levels of Bloom's Taxonomy.},

Abstract = {Engagement with homework assignments is important to be able to actively
   process content during in-class activities in flipped classroom
   education. Active engagement with the content is assumed to promote
   deeper understanding and to improve retention of knowledge. This
   comparative case study aims to explore student workload during homework
   activities and examines in-class activities next to student motivation
   and their retention of knowledge in both traditional education and
   flipped classrooms.
   This quasi-experimental study was conducted in a Hematology and Oncology
   course, which is scheduled in the second year of medical education, in
   Utrecht, the Netherlands. Students' self-reported study time in
   traditional classrooms (2014) and flipped classrooms (2015) were
   measured during one course with a daily online questionnaire and
   in-class activities were explored using an observation scheme and audio
   recordings. Cognitive evaluation theory was used to investigate student
   motivation by measuring perceived autonomy and competence
   (self-efficacy) of students at the end of the course. Knowledge
   retention and self-efficacy were (again) measured after 10 months.
   The in-class observations suggested more interactivity in flipped
   classrooms. All participating students reported similar workload during
   the course, whereas exam preparation after flipped classrooms was
   significantly less time consuming. Students in flipped classrooms
   reported higher scores for self-efficacy, whereas perceived autonomy was
   comparable to students learning in traditional classrooms. Ten months
   after the course, retention of knowledge and self-efficacy scores showed
   no difference.
   This study indicated that flipped classroom education required less time
   investment when preparing for the end-of-course exam and students
   perceived higher self-efficacy, which is relevant in the light of
   student stress and burn-out. However, comparison of long-term
   measurements (retention of knowledge and self-efficacy) showed similar
   outcomes for students in traditional classrooms and flipped classrooms.
   It would be interesting to learn whether students trained in flipped
   classroom education turn out to be better problem solvers in their
   future careers. For example, if the students in this study are better
   able to handle patient cases during their clinical rotations.},

Abstract = {Many medical educators, out of necessity imposed by the COVID-19
   pandemic, had to flip their classrooms. However, instead of adapting to
   this new teaching style, many have proceeded in the manner that they
   have always used to create content, opening a slide deck and inserting
   content until they are satisfied with the result. When in fact, we know
   based on evidence and our own experience, that educators should first
   plan, organize, and storyboard before collecting information into a
   presentation {[}1,2].
   If educators need to replace real-world teaching and interaction, we
   believe the next best option is video education, although there are
   other forms of prework that can be utilized to flip medical classrooms,
   including short readings and exercises. We discuss the case for flipping
   medical classrooms, the limitations, and how educators can get started
   flipping their classrooms today. (C) 2022 Elsevier Ltd. All rights

Abstract = {This study compares two teaching methods in an introductory statistics
   course at a large state university. The first method is the traditional
   lecture-based approach. The second method implements a flipped classroom
   that incorporates the recommendations of the American Statistical
   Association's Guidelines for Assessment and Instruction in Statistics
   Education (GAISE) College Report. We compare these two methods, based on
   student performance, illustrate the procedures of the flipped pedagogy,
   and discuss the impact of aligning our course to current guidelines for
   teaching statistics at the college level. Results show that students in
   the flipped class performed better than students in traditional
   delivery. Student questionnaire responses also indicate that students in
   flipped delivery aligned with the GAISE recommendations have built a
   productive mindset in statistics.},

Abstract = {The inverted classroom is characterized as a form of e-learning in which
   the contents are studied online before the classroom. This article
   discusses the use of this methodology in the critical formation of
   students, through an exploratory research, what is the importance of
   this resource and the students' perception in the teaching-learning
   process. The research was developed in class of the 5th night semester
   of the discipline of Hydraulics, Irrigation and Drainage, of the course
   of Agronomic Engineering. The research methodology was based on the
   qualitative and quantitative approach, through a questionnaire available
   in the Google Docs tool with processing through descriptive and content
   analysis. The inverted classroom allows teachers to develop more
   interactive learning activities, and students favor the methodology.
   Therefore, this article points out the potentialities, some of the
   problems faced and students' opinion regarding the methodology.},

Title = {Student Performance Prediction Based on Blended Learning},
Journal = {IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON EDUCATION},
Year = {2021},
Volume = {64},
Number = {1},
Pages = {66-73},
Month = {FEB},
Abstract = {Contribution: This article explored blended learning by implementing a
   student-centered teaching method based on the flipped classroom and
   small private online course (SPOC). The impact of general online
   learning behavior on student performance was analyzed. This work is
   practical and provides enlightenment for learning analysis and
   individualized teaching in blended learning. Background: Providing
   individualized teaching in a large class is an effective way to improve
   teaching quality, but the traditional teaching method makes it difficult
   for teachers to learn about each student's learning situation. Blended
   learning offers the possibility of individualized teaching for teachers.
   The combination of flipped classroom and SPOC is a good way to implement
   blended learning, but few studies have verified the predictability of
   learning performance in such a scenario to explore individualized
   teaching. Intended Outcomes: Students' behavior in blended learning can
   be used to predict their learning outcomes, and the implementation
   method is reproducible. Teachers can implement individualized teaching
   in blended learning. Application Design: The learning activities were
   designed and reconstructed to create a blended learning scenario, data
   that depict students' learning behavior were collected and used to
   predict their performance by a multiple regression model. Student
   performance was measured by the final offline exam, and its
   predictability in the 1/4, 1/2, and 3/4 semester was tested for early
   intervention. Findings: The results show that students' online behavior
   can be predictors of their performance, and with the advance of the
   course, the predicted results are more stable and reliable.},

Abstract = {Active learning pedagogical approaches and methodologies have been shown
   to increase undergraduate student success. Specifically, the flipped
   classroom approach pushes course content outside of the classroom,
   allowing for the focus of each class period to be centered on
   student-student interactions and reducing student cognitive load in
   comparison to a standard lecture environment. Within this flipped
   classroom, the process of constructing explanations is one potential
   instructional tool to support student conceptual learning. This
   design-based research study focused on conceptual learning through the
   scientific practice of constructing explanations in a preparatory
   chemistry course. Using the claims-evidence-reasoning framework,
   students engaged in three activities individually and in small groups
   over the course of a semester, with each activity focusing on a separate
   chemistry concept and utilizing the explanation process of developing a
   claim, drawing upon evidence to support the claim, and using evidence to
   provide reasoning for the claim through highlighting relevant scientific
   concepts. To gain insight into how flipping these explanations
   activities can impact student learning, students in the course completed
   each activity while in class for the first iteration of the study; in
   the second iteration, students in the same course completed the
   individual portion of the activity outside of class and exchanged ideas
   in small groups during the next class period. Results show that shifting
   the process of individual explanation outside of the classroom allowed
   for more time for student discussion of the material in small groups,
   leading to better explanations of natural phenomena and greater
   chemistry content understanding.},

Abstract = {Theological colleges and seminaries across the Anglican Communion are at
   a crossroads and this essay proposes a reorientation of their life
   towards serving the intentional discipleship of the whole people of God.
   This kind of change would affect the culture as well as the content of
   what they do. For example, their pedagogy could become that of `the
   flipped classroom', where ordinands engage in an apprenticeship style of
   learning, with their time in college falling within placement learning
   and providing constructive theological reflection upon that prior
   learning. This will bring great benefits to these institutions through
   their becoming re-connected and re-embedded in the life of the church at
   grass roots level, giving them a valued and indispensable role in the
   mission of the church in diverse contexts.},

Abstract = {The pervasive application of Small Private Online Course (SPOC) provides
   a powerful impetus for the reform of higher education. During the
   teaching process, a teacher needs to understand the difficulty of SPOC
   videos for students in real time to be more focused on the difficulties
   and key points of the course in a flipped classroom. However, existing
   educational data mining techniques pay little attention to the SPOC
   video difficulty clustering or classification. In this paper, we propose
   an approach to cluster SPOC videos based on the difficulty using
   video-watching data in a SPOC. Specifically, a bipartite graph that
   expresses the learning relationship between students and videos is
   constructed based on the number of video-watching times. Then, the
   SimRank++ algorithm is used to measure the similarity of the difficulty
   between any two videos. Finally, the spectral clustering algorithm is
   used to implement the video clustering based on the obtained similarity
   of difficulty. Experiments on a real data set in a SPOC show that the
   proposed approach has better clustering accuracy than other existing
   ones. This approach facilitates teachers learn about the overall
   difficulty of a SPOC video for students in real time, and therefore
   knowledge points can be explained more effectively in a flipped
   classroom.},

Abstract = {Background: The present study aims to investigate the effect of two
   educational strategies to teach geriatrics (flipped classroom-FL and
   traditional lectures-TR) in relation to a control group (no
   intervention) on students' competences. Method: An intervention study
   was conducted during the third year of medicine. Two different
   educational strategies (flipped classroom and traditional lectures) were
   incorporated into a theoretical-practical discipline of geriatrics.
   Students were evaluated about their attitudes towards older persons
   (Maxwell-Sullivan, UCLA geriatric attitudes), empathy
   (Maxwell-Sullivan), knowledge (Palmore and cognitive knowledge), skills
   (standardized patient assessment), and satisfaction with the activities.
   Results: A total of 243 students were assessed. The FL group
   demonstrated greater gains in knowledge among students and improved
   attitude compared to the TR. We found no differences in the skills using
   a standardized patient. In addition, students exposed to FL felt more
   prepared to treat older people, believed they had more knowledge, were
   more satisfied, and evaluated the discipline's format better in relation
   to the traditional group. Conclusions: Strategies in teaching geriatrics
   can impact students' knowledge, attitudes, and satisfaction with the
   course. We found that the way this teaching is delivered can influence
   students' learning, since there were differences between active and
   traditional strategies.},

Abstract = {The flipped classroom is believed to promote a sense of continuity in
   the classroom and nurture learner autonomy. If students learn to
   self-regulate, they are more likely to gain desired skills. This study
   investigates self-regulated learning (SRL) motivation as possible
   predictors of Asian undergraduate students' English proficiency in a
   flipped online English as a foreign language (EFL) classroom.
   Undergraduate Japanese EFL students were paired with counterparts in
   Malaysia. Working in a computer - mediated environment, learners worked
   together to complete tasks. Learners' output and thoughts about the
   experience were documented online, and questionnaires were used to
   elicit data on self-regulation and motivation. We found that
   metacognitive and cognitive strategy use, combined with peer learning
   promoted by learners' self-efficacy leads to improved English
   proficiency.},

Abstract = {Digitisation has become a part of quality education and can help change
   the teacher's role from a lecturer to a supervisor, encourage a more
   student-centred approach, and increase the interactivity between the
   teacher and the students. However, it can be challenging to facilitate
   more interactive pedagogy in large classes. The aim of this study was to
   gain knowledge about nursing students' experience with the use of a
   student response system (SRS) in learning activities when learning
   physiology. This study was conducted at a university college in Norway,
   which offers Bachelor of Nursing degrees. In the Anatomy and Physiology
   course, a flipped classroom design, including the use of an SRS, was
   offered to nursing students. Data were collected in 2014 using focus
   group interviews with six students who were enrolled in the course and
   analysed using systematic text condensation. From this, four categories
   emerged describing the students' experiences with how the use of the SRS
   can support their learning: 1) creating a welcoming and stimulating
   learning environment, 2) encouraging participation in learning
   activities on campus, 3) facilitating collaboration on campus and 4)
   motivating students to study before and after on-campus meetings. The
   findings indicate that an SRS can be combined with different pedagogical
   strategies. Additionally, teachers should be aware of what kind of
   questions facilitate participation in polls versus those that are
   perceived as too challenging. New university college students studying
   within a flipped classroom design may struggle to prepare adequately
   before class meetings and need guidance from the teacher to handle both
   a new teaching approach and a new student role.},

Abstract = {The increasing demand for advanced genomic services has finally come to
   the attention of healthcare systems and stakeholders who are now eager
   to find creative solutions to increase the pool of genomic literate
   providers. Training in genetics and dysmorphology has historically been
   conducted as a self-driven practice in pattern recognition, ideally
   within a formal or informal apprenticeship supervised by a master
   diagnostician. In recent times, case-based learning, framed by flipped
   classroom pedagogy have become the preferred teaching methods for
   complex medical topics such as genetics and genomics. To illuminate this
   perspective, our article was written in honor of the teaching style and
   pedagogy of Dr John M. Graham Jr and his lifelong commitment to medical
   education and mentoring.},

Abstract = {With continuous development of internet technology, the concept of
   ubiquitous learning and network learning space have received more and
   more attention from scholars, and gradually become the research focuses.
   College classroom has turned to network teaching from traditional
   teaching. In this study, literature review and case study were combined
   with ubiquitous learning and network learning space construction to
   systematically discuss classification and concept models of network
   learning space under the perspective of ubiquitous learning. Meanwhile,
   four models based on network learning space were proposed, and flipped
   classroom network teaching model was applied in the course of Exercise
   Physiology. The study showed that, the model has the good teaching
   effect in course teaching. It not just improves students' interest, but
   also lays a foundation for popularizing the teaching mode.},

Abstract = {Blended learning and flipped classroom models are increasingly
   encouraged in higher education, where notions of flexibility and
   technological development inform institutional systems and strategies.
   This article presents results from an Australian study on redesigning
   and delivering an introductory sociology course using a combination of
   such models. Four central elements of the redesign are highlighted:
   overall course format; use of mini-lectures; face-to-face activities;
   and our assessment model. We present analysis of students' and
   instructors' understandings and experiences of the redesign over three
   course iterations to offer insight into the unfolding and responsive
   dynamics involved in implementing blended and flipped models. We aim to
   contribute to the ongoing implementation of similar models in the
   context of changing institutional environments and expectations, as well
   as to broader projects for pedagogical enrichment in sociology.},

   international economics course},
Journal = {INTERNATIONAL REVIEW OF ECONOMICS EDUCATION},
Year = {2019},
Volume = {31},
Month = {MAY},
Abstract = {This study applies a flipped classroom format to an international
   economics course. A fully-flipped format where class-time is devoted to
   group exercises, experiments and other active learning activities is
   developed and course material is delivered outside of class. In my
   quasi-experiment, two sections of the course were taught using this
   flipped format (treatment) and another two were taught using a
   traditional lecture (control) with measures of student interest,
   achievement and attendance collected. Students in the flipped sections
   were more interested, prepared and participated more in class. In
   contrast, the evidence shows that those same students attended class
   less often and may have achieved higher grades. Taken together, the
   results suggest that the flipped format may increase learning
   productivity and result in lower attendance for similar grades.},

Title = {Efficiency of flipped classroom with online-based teaching under
   COVID-19},
Journal = {INTERACTIVE LEARNING ENVIRONMENTS},
Abstract = {Due to the spread of COVID-19 worldwide, a large number of universities
   had to close their campuses. To maintain teaching and learning during
   this disruption to the traditional teaching, most universities have
   adopted online teaching model. The current study aimed at investigating
   the efficacy of various online teaching modes as well as comparing a
   proposed combined model of online and flipped learning to other online
   and traditional models. The Learning under COVID-19questionnaire was
   designed and administered to undergraduate engineering students at
   Chengdu University of Information Technology (CUIT). The questionnaire
   included five parts: demographic questions, frequencies of online
   courses, types of online courses, the communication and Q\&A in online
   classes and the effect of online classes, as well as the effect of
   combined model learning. The results of the study showed that, students
   were dissatisfied with online learning in general, and they were
   especially dissatisfied with the communication and Q\&A modes. In
   addition, the combined model of online teaching with the flipped
   learning improved students' learning, attention, and evaluation of
   courses.},

Abstract = {The study aims to identify the effect of a flipped classroom approach
   designed according to the cognitive theory of multimedia learning on the
   academic achievements of eighth-grade students (aged 14 years) in Saudi
   Arabia in computer science. To this end, a quasi-experimental design was
   used, with a sample of 67 students; 33 students were assigned to the
   experimental group, whereas 34 comprised the control group. The
   experimental group was subjected to the flipped classroom approach,
   whereas the control group was given direct instruction. To measure
   student achievements, an instrument that measures cognitive skills based
   on Revised Bloom's taxonomy levels was designed. Findings revealed a
   positive effect on the experimental group's achievement levels with
   respect to Bloom's higher order thinking skills, that is, applying,
   analysing, and evaluating. No difference was found between the two
   groups in terms of academic achievements at the remembering and
   understanding levels of Bloom's taxonomy. Moreover, learners with low
   prior knowledge showed a higher improvement in academic achievements
   compared with those with high prior knowledge. This corresponds to the
   assumption of the cognitive theory of multimedia learning that learners
   with low prior knowledge would benefit from its principles more than
   learners with high prior knowledge.},

Abstract = {This study aimed to reveal the effect of using the flipped learning
   strategy on the development of achievement and the trend towards it
   among eighth grade students in the English language subject in the
   Hashemite Kingdom of Jordan. The sample of the study consisted of a
   sample of eighth-grade students who study in government schools
   affiliated with the Directorate of Education in the Northern Mazar
   District in the Hashemite Kingdom of Jordan, and their number (50)
   students were distributed into two groups chosen randomly, one of them
   is a control group, and the number of its students is (25) and the other
   Experimental and the number of its students (25) students. Where the
   control group was taught using the usual method, the experimental group
   was taught using the flipped learning strategy. To achieve the
   objectives of the study, the researcher used the descriptive approach
   and the experimental approach (with a quasi-experimental design), and
   the study tools were: an achievement test and a questionnaire to measure
   attitude. The study materials also included educational software. The
   results of the study indicated that there was a statistically
   significant difference between the average scores of the group of
   students. The experimental group and the control group in the post
   application of the attitude scale in favour of the experimental group,
   and this indicates that the use of the flipped classroom strategy had an
   impact on developing students' attitudes towards it. In light of this,
   the researcher recommends several recommendations, most notably taking
   advantage of the standards and the proposed educational model in the
   current research in the field of English language learning, as well as
   the application of multimedia programs in the use of the flipped
   classroom strategy, to raise the level of students in the basic stage in
   academic achievement, and to expand the application of e-learning And
   blended learning to improve students' attitudes towards using the
   flipped classroom strategy to learn English, holding training courses
   for teachers on the use of the flipped learning strategy, and employing
   modern technologies and social networks in the educational process.},

Abstract = {Online kindergarten to twelfth grade (K-12) language learners have
   usually been found to hold more negative perceptions of their courses
   and to perform less well academically than their face-to-face
   counterparts, despite the well-attested benefits of computer-mediated
   communication in language learning. In an attempt to improve upon such
   outcomes, this study designed, implemented, and evaluated a 12-day
   immersive online high-school Chinese-language course that included daily
   synchronous sessions and interactive technology-enhanced tasks, with a
   special emphasis on engaging the students in meaningful social
   interactions. Based on the analysis of the 35 participants' survey
   responses and their language performance, they had a very positive
   experience of the course, felt satisfied by it, and showed statistically
   significant improvement in their language skills. These findings are
   discussed in relation to prior studies' findings and current
   online-education policies and practices.},

Title = {New Partially Flipped Electromagnetics Classroom Approach Using
   Conceptual Questions},
Journal = {INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF ENGINEERING EDUCATION},
Year = {2019},
Volume = {35},
Number = {4},
Pages = {1215-1223},
Abstract = {We propose using Conceptual Questions to assess class pre-work and
   improve students' grasp of core concepts of the reading material, as
   well as facilitate problem-based learning, in electromagnetics classes
   of the junior year of the electrical engineering program. We also
   investigate the effectiveness and impact of a teaching method based on
   the combined use of Conceptual Questions and partially flipped classroom
   on students' academic performance in an electromagnetics course. Best
   practices in engineering education require the students to engage very
   intensely in the assigned pre-work, which must be meaningfully motivated
   and assessed. A general way to address this need is the use of
   Conceptual Questions, namely, multiple-choice questions that focus on
   understanding and mastery of core concepts in electromagnetics, while
   requiring no or very little calculations, in class pre-work. According
   to our approach, prior to each classroom meeting, students complete an
   online, timed quiz with a set of meticulously designed Conceptual
   Questions concerning the preassigned reading topics, which enables the
   implementation of a partially flipped classroom instruction of
   electromagnetics. This study discusses and evaluates such use of
   conceptual quizzes, with the impact on students' learning, attitude, and
   success, analyzed and assessed in multiple ways. Student performance on
   midterm and final exams and overall class scores (in a class with 83
   students), including both the D/F/W and the A-level grade rates, as well
   as their results on the Electromagnetics Concept Inventory assessment
   instrument, have shown substantial improvements under the proposed
   method when compared to the traditional pedagogical approach of previous
   years. Overall, this is one of the most extensive applications of such
   questions in the electromagnetics area, and likely any
   electrical-engineering area.},

Abstract = {Flipping the classroom (FTC) is a didactical approach aimed at letting
   students come to class prepared and apply the learning material actively
   during class. As FTC places a higher demand on students' self-regulated
   learning (SRL) skills, our goal in the current study was to research the
   effects of SRL support in a flipped classroom on students' SRL
   (self-reports and online activities) and learning outcomes. Previous
   research showed that video embedded SRL prompts enhances students' SRL
   and learning outcomes. We measured the effects of SRL prompts with a
   quasi-experimental design in six flipped History classrooms in secondary
   education where 154 students were randomly assigned to the SRL prompts
   or no SRL prompt condition. We found positive effects of the SRL prompts
   for the completion rate of the instructional videos (i.e., students in
   the SRL prompts condition watched more videos), but not for other
   indicators of SRL or learning outcomes. Thus, in contrast to previous
   research from higher education, our results show that implementing SRL
   prompts in a flipped classroom is not directly effective in secondary
   education. We address potential explanations for the absence of effects
   of the SRL prompts for theory and practice into SRL support in flipped
   classrooms.},

Abstract = {Higher Education Institutions are interested in describing
   qualifications in terms of competences and abilities that prepare
   graduates best for their future professional and social life. This study
   aims to analyze students' acquisition of competences, on one hand,
   inside the classroom using a flipped learning approach, on the other
   hand, outside the classroom through students' self-study using
   information and communication technology resources such as teaching
   videos, virtual labs, simulations, or game-based learning. The study
   also wants to shed light on the relationship between the achieved
   competences and the learning outcomes. The analysis was based on the
   data collected from a core subject in the first year of the Computer
   Engineering and Information Systems degree courses. The answers to an
   online survey (n=285) were examined by using a structural equation model
   with 13 observed and seven latent variables. The results obtained show
   that the learning environment created inside and outside the classroom
   plays a key role in the acquisition and development of the three
   competences analyzed: systematic, personal, and cooperative. Our
   findings also suggest that competence or skills acquisition, despite
   being considered one of the main issues in the higher education
   qualifications framework, does not exactly match the academic results
   measured during the assessment process.},

Abstract = {Objective: The purpose of this study was to assess the change in student
   confidence to perform oncology pharmacy competencies before and after
   completing oncology didactic instruction using a flipped classroom
   approach.
   Methods: First year doctor of pharmacy students completed a survey prior
   to the Applied Science and Therapeutics (AST) oncology module
   (pre-survey) and the same survey following the completion of the
   oncology module (post-survey). The survey consisted of questions
   addressing prior oncology pharmacy experience related to employment
   (research or patient care) and education, level of interest in oncology
   pharmacy, and level of confidence to perform thirteen oncology pharmacy
   competencies.
   Results: One-hundred sixteen students completed the pre-survey and 35
   completed the postsurvey. Students completing both surveys reported
   greater confidence in all oncology pharmacy competencies (p < 0.0001)
   after instruction. The greatest increases in student confidence were
   related to chemotherapy dose calculations, patient education, and
   drug-drug interactions.
   Conclusions: The delivery of oncology content using flipped classroom
   instruction in the AST course successfully increased student confidence
   in ability to perform oncology pharmacy competencies. Cancer screening,
   cancer risk factors, and the preparation and dispensing of chemotherapy
   were competencies identified as needing greater emphasis in classroom
   instruction. Future studies are needed to assess students knowledge and
   application of oncology pharmacy competencies in both the experiential
   and classroom settings.},

Abstract = {The flipped classroom (FC) andragogy purports an improvement of critical
   thinking and problem-solving skills in students. This literature review
   explores fourteen research studies and discusses outcome measures
   reported on the effectiveness of using this teaching modality. Students
   described the learning activities during the classroom meeting times as
   valuable and indicated the interaction and engagement were beneficial to
   their learning. Many students opined an increased comprehension of the
   subject matter. Overall, the FC required more work on the part of the
   students and the faculty, and the majority of students preferred the
   traditional classroom (TC) passive method of learning over the FC active
   learning andragogy as a result of the substantial time commitment
   required for preparation necessitated by the FC. Five of the fourteen
   studies evaluated student learning outcome measures; four studies showed
   an improvement in the FC environment compared to the TC and one reported
   the FC was at least as effective as the TC. Further studies with
   quantifiable outcome measures are required to determine the
   effectiveness of a FC on critical thinking and problem-solving skills of
   nursing students.},

Title = {Implementing a theory-driven gamification model in higher education

Abstract = {Flipped learning can provide more in-class time for students to practice
   and apply knowledge and to receive feedback from peers and teachers.
   However, empirical studies have reported several problems that may occur
   with flipped classroom activities, including the failure of students to
   access out-of-class learning materials. Students who do not complete
   out-of-class work benefit little from the subsequent in-class discussion
   and problem-solving activities. This study offers a new contribution by
   exploring whether gamification could be a strategy to motivate students
   to participate in more out-of-class activities without forfeiting
   quality of work. We applied crucial aspects of five motivation theories
   to propose a goal-access-feedback-challenge-collaboration (GAFCC)
   gamification design model. We then implemented and tested this
   theory-driven model in two quasi-experimental studies involving
   postgraduate students. Collective results from the two experiments
   revealed that (a) the GAFCC class completed significantly more pre- and
   post class activities than the control class and (b) the GAFCC class
   produced higher quality work than the control class. Participants'
   perceptions of gamification were also collected through interviews, and
   reported in this study. This evidence supports a call for further
   research into the use of the GAFCC model in flipped classroom
   implementation.},

Abstract = {Flipped learning is considered an increasingly common strategy along
   with some drawbacks. Gamification has the significant potential to deal
   with the drawbacks. This study presents a systematic literature review
   on the use of gamification in flipped learning research. To demonstrate
   its effectiveness clearly, the only empirical research was covered
   related to this topic. The Web of Science, Scopus, Wiley Online Library,
   ERIC and Science Direct databases were surveyed and a total of twenty
   two articles were selected for the review. The findings reveal that
   adding game elements into a flipped classroom yields higher motivation,
   participation and better learning performance. Yet there is insufficient
   evidence to generalize the results. It is also found that the platforms,
   Moodle and Kahoot, are the most preferred platforms and points, badges
   and leaderboards are the most used game elements for gamification.},

Abstract = {The flipped learning approach over the years has gained importance,
   especially in higher educational establishments that primarily focus on
   more personalized learning for the students. In this context, the
   current study evaluates a flipped learning approach which was
   implemented by a higher education institution from the Middle East
   region as a pilot project and analyses the impact of the flipped
   approach on the student performance from the educators' perspective. The
   study focuses on different aspects like the impact of the flipped
   approach on student performance in a different type of assessments, the
   impact of the flipped approach on academic performance, learning and
   development, and academic support activities. Also, this article
   analyses whether flipped learning reduces the plagiarism cases, impact
   on student attendance, student participation in extracurricular
   activities, impact on student's knowledge, influence on student
   collaboration, effect on improvement in the ability to solve problems
   and impact of this approach on helping students to take the
   responsibility of their learning and become self-learners. This study
   empirically identified the learning outcomes from a flipped class and
   provides recommendations for the educators and higher education
   institutions for successful implementation of the flipped learning
   approach.},

Title = {Attendance, engagement and performance in a medical school curriculum:
   early findings from competency-based progress testing in a new medical
   school curriculum},
Journal = {PEERJ},
Year = {2018},
Volume = {6},
Month = {JUL 30},
Abstract = {Introduction. Medical students often do not value attending in-person
   large group sessions. It is also not clear from prior research whether
   attendance at large group sessions impact on performance in medical
   school. The goal of this study was to assess the relationship between
   voluntary attendance in large group sessions organized as a ``flipped
   classroom{''} in a new innovative curriculum and students' mastery of
   clinical applications of basic science knowledge.
   Methodology. Our students' ability to apply basic science knowledge to
   clinical problems is assessed via progress testing using three
   methodologies: a locally developed multiple-choice examination, written
   examination developed through the National Board of Medical Examiners
   (NBME) Customized Assessment Services Program and post encounter
   questions included in a clinical skills examination. We analyzed the
   relationship between voluntary attendance at weekly large group
   ``flipped classroom{''} sessions and the students' performance on
   examinations given at four intervals over the initial 24-week module of
   the medical school curriculum.
   Results. Complete data were available for 167 students. A total of 82
   students (49.1\%) attended all large group sessions, 65 students
   (38.9\%) missed one or two sessions and 20 students (12.0\%) missed
   three or more sessions. There were no difference between the students in
   the groups on their medical admission (MCAT) examination scores. The
   growth in performance from each time point until the next was
   statistically significant. There was no statistically significant
   difference in growth between the students who had no absences and those
   who had one or two absences. Students who missed three or more sessions
   performed significantly lower than their peers over the 24 week module
   and were more likely to score one or more standard deviations below the
   class mean on the assessments.
   Conclusions. We found no relationship between attendance and MCAT scores
   suggesting the differences in performance on the progress tests was not
   due to initial differences in knowledge or reasoning skills. While the
   study was not experimental, it suggests large group sessions using a
   ``flipped classroom{''} approach to provide reinforcement, feedback and
   practice may be effective for increasing learning and retention in the
   application of basic science knowledge among first year medical
   students.},

   methodology with management accounting students},
Journal = {INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF MANAGEMENT EDUCATION},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {20},
Number = {1},
Month = {MAR},
Abstract = {The aim of this paper is to integrate active methodology on corporate
   social responsibility (CSR)(1) learning into management accounting
   studies. The linkages between sustainable management and management
   accounting demand those future managers integrate CSR into their
   training in an effective way, as they will become change agents for CSR.
   A representative sample of students at the University of Jaen has been
   selected in order to adopt CSR active learning, which allows us to draw
   conclusions about how they perceive CSR and its management. Qualitative
   methodology has been integrated in this project-based learning using
   flipped classroom. Our evidence full supports the validity of the CSR
   active learning methodology to create an effective learning context that
   involves professional and emotional competences, as the answers offered
   mainly included some relevant topics covered by CSR research and social
   and environmental accounting (SEA). This study contributes to previous
   literature assessing the potential of active methodologies in CSR
   learning. Also, it provides important insights for university and
   business school managers to design or modify curricula that are related
   to management accounting in line with sustainability.},

Abstract = {Lectures are a common teaching method in higher education. However, they
   have many serious limitations, including boredom, attendance, short
   attention span, low knowledge transmission and the passivity of
   students. This paper suggests how a combination of
   electroencephalography (EEG) and eye-tracking technology could address
   some of these limitations - an approach that I have called
   neurolecturing. Neurolecturing could measure students' attention,
   learning and cognitive load and provide real time feedback to students
   and lecturers. It could also play a role in the flipped classroom and
   artificial intelligence tutoring.},

Pages = {36-48},

Abstract = {The core educational purposes of scientific models are to help student
   learning as well as develop the students' problem solving skills. This
   study uses three-stage method of literature review, expert Delphi
   method, open-ended questionnaires, and focus interviews to investigate
   the flipping classroom method based upon modern teaching technologies
   and investigate the effects of the teaching method upon the students'
   learning of physics models and modeling skills. This study employed a
   quasi-experimental approach by comparing pre- and post-class results of
   students who underwent three different learning methods, namely: (1)
   model-based flipped classroom supported by modern teaching technology
   (MFC), (2) flipped classroom (FC), and (3) model-based classroom.
   Students who underwent the MFC method achieved significant improvements
   in the 5 phases of the physics modeling process and gave higher scores
   in the 4 dimensions of classroom teaching quality evaluation, namely (1)
   communication and cooperation, (2) application and learning, (3)
   curriculum learning, and (4) participation. The model based flipping
   classroom supported by modern teaching technologies (MFC) used in this
   study effectively guided students through the 3 steps of new knowledge
   construction during the learning process, provided an empirical
   reference for applying modern teaching technologies and flipping
   classroom teaching methods in actual settings, and inspired new mindsets
   for applying and developing teaching theories. (C) 2018 Elsevier Ltd.

Title = {Effectiveness of Pedagogical Tools for Teaching Medical Gross Anatomy
   During the COVID-19 Pandemic},
Journal = {MEDICAL SCIENCE EDUCATOR},
Abstract = {Medical institutions have been forced to modify gross anatomy pedagogy
   to comply with the health restrictions imposed by the novel coronavirus
   (COVID-19). Boston University School of Medicine (BUSM) is one such
   institution that temporarily restructured its course. We replaced
   cadaveric dissection activities with prosections and placed a greater
   emphasis on a flipped classroom model. This study investigates the
   effectiveness of new course materials developed to aid these curriculum
   changes. Course materials were developed for three purposes: (1)
   preparation before laboratory sessions (orientation videos and Complete
   Anatomy (3D4Medical, Elsevier) screens); (2) guidance during laboratory
   sessions (laboratory guides); and (3) review after laboratory sessions
   (Zoom recitation sessions). We performed a grounded theory thematic
   analysis of students' responses (80/160, 50\% response) to qualitative
   survey questions and to focus group questions (16 students who
   self-selected between 4 different sessions). Data from both the survey
   and focus groups demonstrated that the vast majority of students agreed
   that the materials helped them navigate through learning gross anatomy.
   However, laboratory guides were used mostly for post-lab review as
   opposed to the intended direction during laboratory sessions. Students
   within all focus groups overwhelmingly touted the value of Zoom
   recitation sessions, with many stating that they were imperative to
   course success. When comparing performance data between 2019 (pre-COVID)
   and 2020 students, we found that the students who took the anatomy
   course during the onset of COVID had a slightly higher overall average
   score in all three modules of the course than compared to the 2019
   students. We propose that the utilization of course materials that
   students perceived as time saving and pertinent to their exam
   performance, when combined with cadaveric prosection, emphasized the
   benefits of flipped-classroom learning to help students learn gross
   anatomy effectively and efficiently during the pandemic and beyond.},

Abstract = {Flipped classrooms have been recognized as a potential approach that
   enables students to have flexible time to learn before the class as well
   as more opportunities to apply knowledge and to interact with peers and
   the teacher in the class. On the other hand, researchers have pointed
   out the challenge of engaging students in self-regulated learning and
   active participation in flipped classrooms. In this study, an Instant
   Response System (IRS)-facilitated collective issue-quest strategy is
   proposed for engaging students in active and self-regulated flipped
   learning. Moreover, a quasi-experimental design was conducted with
   undergraduate students in an internet marketing course in northern
   Taiwan to investigate the impacts of the proposed approach on the
   students' learning achievement, self-regulation, learning satisfaction
   and collective efficacy. The experimental results revealed that the
   learning achievement, collective efficacy and satisfaction of the
   students who learned with the proposed approach were significantly
   better than those of the students learning with the conventional flipped
   classroom approach. Moreover, in the ``environment,{''} ``task
   strategies{''} and ``help seeking{''} dimensions of self-regulation, the
   former had significantly higher ratings than the latter. This study
   contributes analysis results that highlight the benefits of implementing
   the IRS-facilitated collective issue-quest approach in the flipped
   classroom. The results of this research may provide a valuable reference
   for future studies and practice in the field.},

Abstract = {Writing as a multiple-step process is one of the most complex and
   demanding skills for graduate students to master. Foreign or second
   language learners who are required to write for academic purposes at the
   university level may even find it more demanding to master. One of the
   ways of decreasing the burden of mastering this skill for learners is
   mediation, using scaffolding techniques to teach writing. Hence, having
   a good understanding of the impact(s) of adopting mediating or
   scaffolding techniques in writing classes is absolutely indispensable.
   To this end, the present study employed an experimental research design
   to investigate the impact of mediation in the flipped writing classrooms
   of the students of medicine. To peruse this goal, 47 medical students
   were selected through purposive sampling and put into control and
   treatment groups. Medical students in the treatment group watched
   teacher-made video content(s) before their writing classes. The students
   in this group experienced organized-interactive writing group activities
   in their classes. Unlike the experimental group, the students in the
   control group received all the instructions in the classroom and were
   assigned homework. The findings obtained through the ANOVA and t-test
   indicated that the students in the experimental group significantly
   outperformed their counterparts in the control group in terms of their
   writing. A probable conclusion could be that by requiring students to
   study in advance and take responsibility for their learning, flipped
   classroom can provide the opportunity for learners to actively construct
   knowledge rather than receive the information passively in the
   classroom. Flipped classroom can also cultivate interactive class time
   for teachers and enable them to invest in more fruitful academic
   practices, instead of asking students to spend a substantial amount of
   time each week doing homework independently.},

Abstract = {Background and purpose: The primary objective of this investigation was
   to determine the effectiveness of different active learning exercises in
   a newly-designed flipped-classroom self-care course in applying newly
   acquired knowledge of self-care and improving the confidence of
   first-year pharmacy students to recommend self-care treatments and
   counsel patients. The early development of these skills is essential for
   the subsequent Community Introductory Pharmacy Practice Experience
   (CIPPE).
   Educational activity and setting: An unpaired anonymous survey was
   administered to students, pre- and post-course, to ascertain their
   opinions on the effectiveness of various teaching strategies and active
   learning exercises on learning and on their confidence in
   treatment-planning and patient counseling for self-care patients.
   Comparison between pre- and post-course Likert scores was conducted
   using a one-way ANOVA followed by a post-hoc Tukey's test with
   significance at p = 0.05. All other tests of significance were conducted
   using a student's t-test with significance at p = 0.05.
   Findings: Students' self-confidence in developing treatment plans and in
   counseling for nonprescription drugs and dietary supplements
   significantly improved from the beginning to the end of this self-care
   course. The response rate was high in both the pre-(N = 208, 88.1\%) and
   post (N = 198, 83.9\%) course surveys. The positive change in confidence
   was not reflected in increased performance on the final exam represented
   by a lower average score than the midterm exam.
   Discussion and summary: Active learning sessions and the flipped
   classroom approach in this first-year pharmacy self-care course
   contributed to increased self-confidence in making recommendations and
   counseling patients on proper use of nonprescription medications and
   dietary supplements.},

Title = {Preclerkship Point-of-Care Ultrasound: Image Acquisition and Clinical
   Transferability},
Journal = {JOURNAL OF MEDICAL EDUCATION AND CURRICULAR DEVELOPMENT},
Year = {2020},
Volume = {7},
Month = {JUL},
Abstract = {Introduction: The integration of point-of-care ultrasound (POCUS) in
   preclerkship medical education is currently popular and based on the
   notion that POCUS may improve diagnostic and procedural skills in
   medical students. However, empirical evidence demonstrating that POCUS
   can enhance clinical skills in preclerkship students has been lacking.
   We sought to evaluate anatomical sonographic knowledge and ultrasound
   generation capabilities associated with the implementation of a 3-h
   echocardiography training camp led by 2 emergency physicians and using a
   flipped classroom design.
   Methods: Preclerkship students from the University of Ottawa (n=32) were
   recruited to participate. A flipped classroom model was adopted,
   providing students with a 3-chaptered peer-designed, expert validated
   ultrasound manual before the workshop, to maximize scanning times (2h of
   reading). A pretest Likert-type design was used to assess student
   perception of the ultrasound tool. Similarly, a pretest/post-test model
   was used to assess sonographic anatomical identification. In addition, a
   subsequent Objective Structured Clinical Examination (OSCE) test was
   done 3weeks after the hands-on session, to evaluate image generation (4
   cardiac views: parasternal long, parasternal short, subxiphoid, and
   apical 4 chambers), understanding of knobology and structural labeling.
   Results: For the sonographic anatomy, there was a statistically
   significant increase (P<.001) between pretest (average=12.12) and
   post-test (average=18.85). The OSCE, which also ascertained knowledge
   retention, found that 81\% of students were able to generate all 4
   cardiac views perfectly, 6\% were able to obtain 3 views, 10\% obtained
   2 views and 3\% successfully generated a single view. The most
   challenging scan to generate was the apical 4-chamber view.
   Conclusion: The positive outcomes stemming from this study reinforces
   the notion that formal curricular integration of POCUS at the
   preclerkship level has tangible benefits for medical students.},

Abstract = {The article examines the teacher/student perspective about E-learning
   modules that could be applied to the courses of the Administration
   career at the Universidad Nacional Mayor de San Marcos based on 2
   methodologies that project a better vision of teaching. To carry out
   these methodologies, it is necessary to review the results obtained in a
   survey to determine the factors that influence student learning through
   the proposed E-learning modules. As a result, 6 factors were obtained to
   validate whether these E-learning modules are suitable for Flipped
   Classroom and B-learning Methodologies. It is important to highlight
   that due to the Covid-19 pandemic, different teaching methods have been
   chosen virtually, and the evaluation carried out; it was determined that
   40\% of the students who are virtually taking their courses feel
   satisfied and eager to continue studying using different technological
   tools.},

Abstract = {One of the realities of teaching biochemistry is the density of contents
   and interdisciplinary complexity, aggravated by using a unique or overly
   expository approach. Given this, we evaluated the application of Blended
   learning with gamification, based on the Flipped Classroom (FC), to
   improve learning. The research was developed in the course of Biological
   Sciences/ UFRN-Brazil and had a qualitative-quantitative approach, with
   monitoring of the students through a process of gamification, to
   encourage the engagement of the student. As a result, about 84\% of the
   students reported increased interest in the courses and 94\% stated that
   learning was better in the FC, which can be evidenced by the positive
   impact on the assessment notes. Also, it has been observed that the
   method contributes both to collaborative learning and to personalization
   of learning. Thus, the results provide data for a broad reflection on
   the effectiveness of this model for the Teaching of Biochemistry.},

Abstract = {Relying on advanced network technologies, Massive Open Online Courses
   (MOOCs) can support the transformation and deep construction of
   high-quality open courses. However, with the use of MOOCs in many
   universities and colleges, new issues have emerged. MOOCs are not
   specifically designed for local conditions. Researchers lack
   understanding of the effectiveness of using shared MOOCs in traditional
   university teaching. The purpose of this study was to analyze the
   effectiveness of MOOC-based flipped learning and to propose clear reuse
   guidelines for MOOCs in the traditional university education. We
   conducted a quasi-experiment in an inorganic chemistry course. The
   results were presented in terms of learners' participation and learning
   performance, and a post-task survey and interviews were also conducted
   to investigate the students' experiences in order to include these
   experiences in design and research plans of MOOCs-based flipped
   learning. The results showed that students in the MOOC-based flipped
   classroom on average performed better than those in the traditional
   classroom. However, no changes in self-efficacy and self-regulated
   learning were detected after the end of the course. In addition, the
   quantitative and qualitative data combined indicated that most students
   had a favorable experience of the flipped classroom, in terms of
   student-student interaction, available learning materials, and active
   learning results. Implications for MOOC integration are discussed.},

Abstract = {We discuss the flipped classroom implementation for a Single Variable
   Calculus (SVC) course in a Confucian Heritage Culture (CHC) environment.
   A theoretical framework is composed of Bloom's taxonomy, English-medium
   instruction (EMI) and technology adaptation. Four different types of
   instructions were designed, three were flipped and one acts as a
   control. We investigate both quantitative and qualitative aspects of the
   pedagogy. Quantitative analysis indicates a statistically significant
   difference in the exam scores between fully-flipped and single-topic
   flipped instruction as determined by one-way ANOVA (F(3, 306) = 2.67, p
   = 0.0477) with a small practical significance of the effect size (eta(2)
   = 0.0255). Qualitative findings suggest that although students'
   engagement and communication with instructors have been enhanced, some
   challenges related to language and culture, along with minimizing
   competition and learning about a new technological tool persist.},

Abstract = {With the growing number of research articles published on flipped
   learning, many aspects of this instructional approach have been well
   researched and thoughtfully discussed. At this point, how can future
   research advance our understanding of flipped learning? This article
   sheds light on three possible directions for future studies of this
   instructional approach, including (1) longitudinal studies, (2)
   examining its effects on different learning objectives, and (3)
   incorporating gamification into flipped courses. A descriptive framework
   for flipped classroom interventions is then proposed, comprising of four
   dimensions: (1) research background, (2) course design, (3) course
   activities, and (4) outcome of interventions. By applying this
   descriptive framework, the knowledge created in future research can be
   well-documented, disseminated, used, and evaluated by other
   practitioners and researchers. The present work can provide a foundation
   for further efforts to research flipped learning.},

Abstract = {This study aimed for using flipped classroom to develop scientific
   communication and the attitude towards technology acceptance in science
   learning among intermediate school students. For this purpose, the
   quasi-experimental design with the experimental and the control group
   method was used. The sample involved 49 third intermediate stage
   students from two different schools in Wadi Al-Dawasir Governorate,
   Riyadh, Saudi Arabia. A list of written scientific communication levels
   suitable for intermediate school students and a procedural model for
   learning with flipped classes were presented. The study applied the
   scientific communication test and the technology acceptance in the
   science learning scale. The statistical analyses revealed that there
   were statistically significant differences between the means of the
   scores of the experimental and control group students in the scientific
   communication scale and the technology acceptance in the science
   learning scale in favor of the experimental group. Recommendations and
   suggestions were presented.},

Abstract = {Institutions adopt paradigm-shifting strategies to improve the
   understanding and assimilation of contents by the students. They seek an
   active participation of the students, dismissing of the classical
   teacher talks-students listen format, with activities performed in and
   out of the classroom. We describe a hybrid-teaching scheme, inspired by
   the flipped classroom scheme, but confined to the time spent in the
   classroom. The methodology ``learn in the classroom{''} was applied in
   the Cell and Molecular Biology II course at the State University of
   Campinas in 2013 and was structured around two hypotheses: (1) the time
   needed to explore major concepts might be greatly reduced and (2) given
   time and opportunity, it is possible to obtain excellent engagement of
   the students, customizing the discussion according with the student's
   interests and needs. Besides describing the methodology, we present the
   results of satisfaction tests and list positive and negative aspects of
   this strategy.},

Abstract = {Pathology informatics is a relatively new field with limited structured
   training programs for pathologists, especially for computer programming.
   Here, we describe our efforts to develop and implement a training
   program in the department of pathology at the University of Florida to
   meet these additional needs of current students as well as faculty and
   staff. Three one-credit courses were created using a flipped classroom
   design. Each course was assessed with a novel survey instrument, and the
   impact of the program was further measured 6 months after program
   completion with interviews of 6 participants and thematic analysis.
   Course objectives were met but with room for improvement. Major factors
   that had a positive impact included collaborative learning and
   real-world practice problems. Also, it improved communication with
   informatics colleagues as well as job task efficiency and effectiveness.
   Overall, the program raised awareness of informatics professional
   development and career path opportunities within pathology.},

Abstract = {Background Most University education is still given in the form of
   classical teacher-oriented instruction, usually as lectures. However,
   from a physiological learning point of view, this form of instruction is
   of little use to students, as without repetitions, they will forget more
   than half of what they have just learned after a short time. Another
   aspect contributing to this issue is that students usually behave
   passively in lectures and an active or even interactive stage of
   learning is typically not achieved. Objectives and methods To counteract
   this dilemma, we have integrated modern teaching methods such as an
   inverted or flipped classroom and audience response systems into our
   Human Genetics classes in Tubingen. In addition, we have implemented
   into our Human Genetics courses problem-based learning, which has
   already been successfully applied in many universities for the study of
   medicine. Results and Conclusions Most students did not yet know these
   modern teaching methods from other courses, but assessed their use very
   positively and wished that these methods could be integrated into
   additional courses as well. We were positively surprised how well these
   modern teaching methods were accepted by the students.},

Abstract = {The Flipped Classroom (FC) method is used widely in higher education,
   with studies claiming various benefits. However, to date, little work
   has focused on what makes FCs effective for student learning. This study
   presents data collected from interviews with 14 UK-based undergraduate
   students, investigating their perceptions of participating in a series
   of FC sessions. Findings indicate that the FC format discouraged a
   significant number of students from attending. However, students who did
   attend the flipped classes reported valuing the resultant learning
   opportunities and enjoying the experience. This study sheds light on the
   learning process within the FC. Challenges in implementing the FC were
   highlighted both by students who attended and by those who did not. We
   conclude that implementing the FC should not be undertaken lightly or be
   seen as a quick fix; at minimum, it requires staff willingness and
   opportunities for engagement and peer learning.},

Abstract = {Based on the importance of the mediator in literary education, this
   paper presents an experience carried out with 46 students of the Degree
   in Preschool Education at two Spanish universities (Castilla-La Mancha
   and Oviedo). The aim was to develop their ability to value literary
   reads for the preschool classroom, as well as to detect their training
   needs. By using an action research method, an action plan was designed
   and subsequently assessed taking into account: an initial questionnaire,
   participant observation, tasks carried out and both students' and
   lecturers' final questionnaires. Following a flipped classroom approach,
   participants read and collaboratively elaborated a rating scale for
   picture books which they then applied to a selection of works. Results
   indicate that students' critical thinking was exercised and that their
   training as mediators improved. Nevertheless, some erroneous ideas
   regarding children's literature persist, which confirms the necessity
   for furthering this type of experiences.},

Abstract = {In this paper, we describe the challenges faced in the implementation of
   active learning methods in the subject of Data Communication \& Computer
   Network in vocational education at the Federal Institute of Brasilia.
   The experiences resulted in a blended methodology which combines
   collaborative and problem-based learning and flipped classroom with a
   learning management system. Popular apps and social networks were used
   to enhance the communication between students and teachers. A
   comparative study shows that the students' performance and the quality
   of the developed activities in the subject were improved under active
   learning in comparison to Traditional Lectures, and transversal skills
   could be developed, such as teamwork, leadership, self-confidence and
   autonomy in decision-making. The research was carried out from 2011 to
   2016 and 160 students were enrolled. Such features demonstrate the
   learning methodology must be fit for the course and the educational
   level in order to become effective.},

Abstract = {Objectives: to analyze the scientific evidence on the strategies of
   active learning methodologies used in the training of nurses, as well as
   their contributions and obstacles in training. Methods: integrative
   literature review conducted with 33 selected articles in the Medical
   Literature Analysis and Retrieval System Online, Latin American and
   Caribbean Literature in Health Sciences, Nursing Database, Scopus, Web
   of Science and Education Resources Information Center databases.
   Results: among the strategies, simulation, problem-based learning and
   flipped classroom were highlighted. The active search, the integration
   of theory and practice and group work were examples of contributions to
   the training of nurses. However, the lack of preparation of the actors
   and the lack of structural support contribute to the dissatisfaction of
   the students. Final Considerations: the active learning methodology
   places the student at the heart of the learning process, favors critical
   thinking and the ability to make decisions.},

Abstract = {Flipped learning is a developing concept in higher education and a new
   methodology ready for exploration. It is a new educational strategy that
   changes the traditional lecturing by flipping the classroom in the sense
   of listening the lectures at home and doing dynamic, group-based
   problem-solving activities in the classroom. This will engage the
   students in active learning, critical thinking and developing new
   studying skills.
   This paper will address the current state of knowledge and practice in
   the flipped learning approach in engineering education by critically
   evaluating the existing researches and summarizing the findings. The
   search for empirical articles included electronic databases for
   engineering education in the Web of Science. Most studies reported high
   student satisfaction and increased performance in a flipped classroom
   environment. This paper will also serve as a guide for future studies
   and reflect the major achievements of flipped learning models over the
   traditional lecture-exercises model in engineering education to support
   and advance the student learning process.},

Abstract = {Aim: To compare the effects of flipped classroom and traditional
   auditorium lectures, on nursing students' examination results in
   bioscience.
   Design: An educational intervention study.
   Methods: All the first-year students in the bachelor programme (N = 493)
   were entered into a database and randomly assigned to the intervention
   or the control group in a course in bioscience. The outcome measures are
   the proportion of students who passed the examination, and the
   distribution of grades from A to E. Chi-square tests and Mann-Whitney
   Wilcoxon test were used. The odds to pass versus fail were modelled
   using binary logistic regression.
   Results: The proportion of students who did not pass the final
   examination was very similar in the intervention and the control groups,
   21.4\% and 23.6\% (p = .574). Our data did not reveal any statistically
   significant differences concerning the distribution of grades (p =
   .691). Students with biology and/or natural science had higher odds for
   passing.},

   during the Covid-19 pandemic: Student learning performance and
   engagement},
Journal = {JOURNAL OF RESEARCH ON TECHNOLOGY IN EDUCATION},
Abstract = {The Covid-19 outbreak has brought the whole world to a standstill,
   forcing schools and universities to move online immediately. The abrupt
   change has led to a general fear of a drop in the quality of education
   due to the loss of physical interaction. Against this background, the
   present study describes how we managed the crisis by adapting a
   conventional flipped course to a fully online flipped course, using the
   community of inquiry conceptual framework. The quantitative analyses
   reveal that online flipped course participants performed as well as
   their counterparts in the conventional flipped learning format, and that
   students' interest levels remained constantly high throughout the online
   flipped classes. The qualitative analyses of the students' survey and
   interview data suggest five key factors that promote their engagement in
   the online flipped classes. The findings of this study provide practical
   guidelines for instructors who are interested in the online flipped
   classroom approach.},

Abstract = {The purpose of this study is to describe the current state of research
   publication and trends in flipped learning, found on `Web of Science'
   during the period 2014-2018. There are 262 papers investigated,
   published and indexed on `Web of Science' with the keyword: ``flipped
   learning{''} and ``flipped classroom{''}. The results of the study are
   analysed according to the journal of publication by these criteria:
   author, countries, funding agencies, document types, languages,
   organisation, publication years and source title. Flipped learning
   changes the traditional lecturing by flipping the classroom in the sense
   of listening to the video lectures at home and doing dynamic,
   group-based activities in the classroom. This engages the students in
   active learning, critical thinking, and meliorates interpersonal
   skills.It is recommended to authors to explore the possibility of
   utilising this method, experimenting and publish the findings which
   allows to create best practices and a unified framework for leading
   instructors who want to adopt this teaching methodology.},

Title = {Integration of 3D Printing and Industry 4.0 into Engineering Teaching},
Journal = {SUSTAINABILITY},
Year = {2018},
Volume = {10},
Number = {11},
Month = {NOV},
Abstract = {The rapid emergence of Industry 4.0 implies that our engineering
   graduates need to acquire new competences to adapt to the digital
   transformation. This paper evaluates the benefits of integrating 3D
   printing and Industry 4.0 into engineering undergraduate programs.
   Surveys were conducted to gather the feedbacks and views from academics
   and students. 75\% and 86\% of the participating students and lecturers,
   respectively, have heard about Industry 4.0. 63\% of the students were
   exposed to modules with such elements. Tangible 3D-printed models enable
   visualization of fundamental theories and concepts. Enhanced 3D drawing
   skills and rapid 3D-printed prototypes can greatly help students study
   common processing equipment, manufacturing, maintenance, logistics, and
   operations. Some limitations were identified such as budgeting, lack of
   knowledge, and difficulty in changing from traditional pedagogy. This
   paper thus proposes a blended learning model for integrating Industry
   4.0 into engineering teaching, which consists of traditional, online
   learning, and flipped classroom approaches. Implementation of the model
   can be started off with cross-multidisciplinary collaborations or
   expert-led training for the instructors, followed by traditional
   face-to-face teaching and online learning. Flipped classroom is one of
   the essential components of the model which encourages
   learning-by-making approaches such as bring your own device' and do it
   yourself'. Integrating Industry 4.0 into engineering teaching can create
   a student-based learning environment, where students are gradually
   trained to become proactive and lifelong learners who are more conscious
   of the environment and economy.},

Abstract = {The last two decades have witnessed a large number of studies on the
   flipped classroom. Learning attitudes, interest and intrinsic motivation
   in mobile device-aided flipped English class (MFC) has, however, seldom
   been studied in comparison with the traditional video-aided flipped
   English class (VFC). Randomly selecting 375 participants and using
   reliable scales, this study identified the differences in and
   correlations of learning attitudes, interest and intrinsic motivation
   between MFC and VFC. After an experiment for one academic year and
   semi-structured interviews, it was concluded that: (1) The learning
   attitude in MFC was significantly more positive than that in VFC; (2)
   The learning interest in MFC was significantly more positive than that
   in VFC; (3) The intrinsic learning motivation in MFC was significantly
   more positive than that in VFC; (4) The learning attitude, interest and
   intrinsic motivation were significantly and mutually correlated in both
   MFC and VFC. Reasons for the findings are also discussed, coupled with
   future research directions.},

   readily accessible technology based resources such as video lectures,
   reading handouts, and practice problems outside the classroom, whereas
   interactive group-based, problem-solving activities conducted in the

   activities during the session. Using class time for active learning
   provides greater opportunity for mentoring and peer to peer
   collaboration. Instead of spending too much time on delivering lectures,
   class time can best be utilized by interacting with students, discussing
   their concerns related to the particular topic to be taught, providing
   real life examples relevant to the course content, challenging students
   to think in a broader aspect about complex process and encouraging
   different team based learning activities.},

Abstract = {To solve the problem of how to apply information technology in English
   education field, to realize the integration of information technology
   and courses and also to truly improve the study efficiency, the advanced
   technologies were combined with some education measurement theories and
   applied in computer-aided test field. In addition, a computer-aided
   autonomous learning system with adaptive feature was developed, which
   was a self-adaptive learning system of junior English. The results
   showed that, under the guidance of the classic test theory and the
   project response theory, the system was designed and developed on the
   basis of the ``people-oriented{''} principle. With the increasing number
   of students wanting to practice, the system dynamically rewrote the
   relevant learning record parameters, and conducted a real-time record of
   the true level of ability of each different student in different
   knowledge points. In a word, practicing according to the actual
   situation, the learning system can help achieve a truly personalized
   learning, and meanwhile enhances the efficiency of learning.},

Title = {Recent Trends of Blended Learning and Flipped Classroom in Malaysia},
Journal = {ARAB WORLD ENGLISH JOURNAL},
Year = {2022},
Number = {SI},
Pages = {290-301},
Month = {JAN},
Abstract = {The classroom is where the student and teacher interact, while
   traditional education uses a Face to-Face classroom. The unprecedented
   COVID-19 forced education to shift into an online classroom. Still,
   numerous researches demonstrate that the pedagogical quality in online
   classrooms is thus compromised as the educators tend to convert existing
   face-to-face curriculum that less prioritize intellectual interaction
   into online ways. Blended learning is not a new yet effective teaching
   pedagogy, which seems suitable to overcome the challenges as mentioned
   above as it is a combination of traditional and online modes. Thus, this
   article summarizes the current trend of blended learning implementation
   in the Malaysian setting into valuable insight for the practitioner to
   redesign their pedagogy to meet new norms. This paper assessed and
   analyzed a total of 22 recent publications that extracted from the Web
   of Science Database based on three themes that are participant,
   instrument, and disciplinary. All researches address higher education
   context, mainly the students' perspectives and neglecting other
   stakeholders' perspectives. Blended learning is proven practical in
   multidisciplinary but independent curriculum, and pedagogy redevelopment
   is mandated. The quantitative methodology is preferable by the
   researcher in the identification of critical governing factors. Overall,
   the context of blended learning development in Malaysia remains
   progressively developing by time. In conclusion, the practice of blended
   learning implementation is getting diffused in Malaysia due to its
   flexibility and versatility. However, such effective pedagogy lay on
   collaborative efforts between various stakeholders, including educators,
   students, institutional management, policymakers, and parent.},

Title = {Comparing Two Resources Used to Teach Pulmonary Patterns for a Flipped

Abstract = {The flipped classroom has been gaining momentum within medical education
   circles. Pre-class assignments are an important component of this
   pedagogical approach. In this study, a section of the introductory
   course to veterinary medical imaging was taught using a flipped
   classroom, and the effectiveness of two different pre-classroom
   assignments was evaluated. The pre-classroom assignments consisted of
   either short videos or readings. Both had similar content, which
   included basic information about pulmonary patterns of disease on chest
   radiographs. Learning outcomes were assessed by in-classroom and final
   examination questions. Student learning self-assessments and student
   satisfaction were also evaluated via an online survey. Students in the
   video group answered more of the in-classroom questions correctly (71\%
   video vs. 63\% reading group; p = .01) and had higher scores on the
   final examination (83\% video vs. 75\% reading group; p = .02). There
   was also a higher student satisfaction with the videos versus the
   reading assignment. However, we found no significant difference in the
   student self-assessments of learning or participation in class. An
   additional finding of this study related to the ongoing difficulties
   students were having with the learning objectives, including
   differentiating a pathological process from a normal, or normal variant,
   recognizing the different pulmonary patterns, and developing a
   differential diagnoses list, despite the pre-classroom assignments and
   large group learning sessions. This speaks to the difficulty in
   developing confidence in pulmonary pattern recognition on chest
   radiographs, a skill that requires considerable training and time
   investment.},

Abstract = {This study investigated the effectiveness of two technology-enhanced
   models of the flipped classroom, discussion-oriented and role-reversal,
   on English language learners' expository writing skills and evaluated
   the proposed models as a means of teaching/learning writing skills. To
   these ends, a quasi-experimental design with three intact classes, one
   control (non flipped group with 17 EFL learners) and two experimental
   (discussion-oriented group with 19 and role-reversal group with 24 EFL
   learners), was adopted. Pre and posttest essays were used to see the
   effectiveness of the two models, which used two digital apps. In
   addition, a researcher-made questionnaire and a semi-structured
   interview were utilized to evaluate the models with regard to writing
   skills. An analysis of covariance uncovered that the discussion oriented
   and role-reversal flipped classrooms were more effective than the non
   flipped ones. Also, the role-reversal group outperformed the
   discussion-oriented group in the writing gains in the posttest
   expository essays. Subsequent analyses demonstrated the positive
   perceptions and experiences about the flipped classrooms, revealing four
   themes of teacher support, personal feeling, peer support, and
   activities within and outside the classroom. This paper concludes with a
   call for technology integration in writing courses and more
   investigation into this promising technology-based pedagogy across
   different language skills.},

Journal = {THINKING SKILLS AND CREATIVITY},
Year = {2018},
Volume = {28},
Pages = {73-83},
Month = {JUN},
Abstract = {This paper examines a critical thinking course developed as part of a
   General Education curriculum. Using qualitative and quantitative
   assessments, it finds that a flipped classroom and mixed model is an
   effective method for providing students with practical critical thinking
   skills, even with instructors with limited experience teaching critical
   thinking. The course includes fourteen units students watch to learn
   explicit critical thinking skills and online quizzes that supply
   immediate feedback. Classroom instruction focuses on application
   exercises that apply the skills and explore a central course theme
   developed by each instructor.},

Title = {Evaluating Whether Flipped Classrooms Improve Student Learning in
   Science Education: A Systematic Review and Meta-Analysis},
Journal = {SCANDINAVIAN JOURNAL OF EDUCATIONAL RESEARCH},
Abstract = {This study aims to determine the effectiveness of flipped classrooms in
   science education through the use of systematic review and
   meta-analysis. A total of 64 studies were analyzed by scanning the
   following databases: Web of Science, Eric, Taylor \& Francis, and
   Education Full Text (EBSCO). Of the studies analyzed, 18 were selected
   for meta-analysis. Since the first study publication in 2013, the use of
   flipped classroom method in science education has since become
   prevalent. This study reveals that quantitative approaches were used as
   a principal research method, university students were preferred as
   primary participants, and that the studies reviewed mainly examined
   classrooms in the context of chemistry courses. As a result of
   meta-analysis, a meaningful effect size pertaining to student
   achievement was revealed, which showed favor towards the use of flipped
   classrooms (Hedges' g = 0.625, 95\% CI {[}0.342, 0.908], p < 0.001).},

Abstract = {As the COVID-19 pandemic forced a sudden shift to online teaching and
   learning in April 2020, one of the more significant challenges faced by
   instructors is encouraging and maintaining student engagement in their
   online classes. This paper describes my experience of flipping an online
   classroom for a core Chemical Engineering Fluid Mechanics class to
   promote student engagement and collaboration in an online setting.
   Comparing exam scores with prior semesters involving in-person,
   traditional lecture-style classes suggests that students need a certain
   degree of adjustment to adapt to this new learning mode. A decrease in
   student rating of teaching (SRT) scores indicates that students largely
   prefer in-person, traditional lectures over an online flipped class,
   even though written comments in the SRT contained several responses
   favorable to flipping the class in an online setting. Overall, SRT
   scores on a department level also showed a similar decrease, which
   suggests students were less satisfied with the quality of teaching
   overall throughout the department, with this flipped method of
   instruction neither improving nor worsening student sentiment toward
   online learning. In addition, whereas most students liked the
   prerecorded lecture videos, they were less enthusiastic about using
   breakout rooms to encourage student collaboration and discussion.
   Further thought and discussion on best practices to facilitate online
   student interaction and collaboration are recommended, as online
   learning will likely continue to grow in popularity even when in-person
   instruction resumes after the pandemic.},

Abstract = {A well-organized educational curriculum for the training of both novice
   and experienced ECMO providers is critical for the continued function of
   an institutional ECMO program. ELSO provides guidance for the education
   for ECMO specialists, physicians and staff, which incorporates
   ``traditional{''} instructor-centered educational methods, such as
   didactic lectures and technical skill training. Novel research suggests
   utilization of strategies that align with principles of adult learning
   to promote active learner involvement and reflection on how the material
   can be applied to understand existing and new constructs may be more
   effective. Some examples include the ``flipped classroom,{''}
   e-learning, simulation, and interprofessional education. These
   methodologies have been shown to improve active participation, which can
   be related to improvements in understanding and long-term retention. A
   novel framework for ECMO training is considered. Challenges in
   assessment and credentialing are also discussed. (C) 2018 Elsevier Inc.

Journal = {PHARMACY},

Abstract = {Building an interactive environment during learning experience is
   sometimes hindered by student numbers in class, their sociocultural
   differences and limited teaching time, which may reduce student
   engagement. In this study we provided a super blended teaching and
   learning model by hybridising Classroom Response System (CRS) with
   Flipped Classroom (FC) and Team-Based Learning (TBL). CRS allowed
   learners to use their smart devices (e.g., phones, tablets and laptops)
   to respond to a variety of numerical, multiple-choice, short-answer and
   open ended questions posed during live classes and encouraged them to
   engage with classroom activities. Our Flipped-CRS (F-CRS) approach
   required the students to preview the e-learning material and watch the
   recorded lectures before the sessions and apply their knowledge within
   the session, either individually or as teams, by answering questions
   using TurningPoint CRS software. Learners provided positive feedback
   regarding F-CRS and the application of super blended teaching and
   learning model demonstrated a substantial increase in student
   collaboration and enhanced their motivation, engagement, attendance and
   academic performance, especially while using F-CRS approach in teams.
   Our super blended approach enabled educators to monitor student
   engagement throughout the year, facilitated formative assessment and
   assisted teachers to create crude class performance prediction in
   summative assessments.},

Abstract = {Recent didactic approaches often focus on the active participation of
   learners, as Learner Centered Teaching, Flipped Classroom and
   Gamification. The question is how these techniques can be used in
   short-terms information literacy courses or within larger groups and
   whether this makes sense regarding the learning success. This article
   examines reasons for using activating methods in information literacy
   trainings and presents various free online tools and group exercises,
   that can be used to activate learners in training. The tools presented
   are suitable for training in public and academic libraries.},

   (ADHD): The Design And Development Of An E-Learning Resource},
Journal = {ADVANCES IN MEDICAL EDUCATION AND PRACTICE},
Year = {2019},
Volume = {10},
Pages = {987-997},
Abstract = {In this paper, we describe how an e-learning resource on Attention
   Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder (ADHD) for medical students was designed
   and developed. The aim of the resource was to provide students with
   essential knowledge and understanding about ADHD prior to their
   attendance at a classroom teaching session as well as to serve as a
   revision tool. The paper focuses on the way in which instructional
   design, educational and multimedia principles were used to inform the
   development of the resource. It also reports results of a small-scale
   evaluation of students' satisfaction with the resource and the way in
   which they believed it impacted knowledge acquisition of ADHD related
   concepts and principles. In addition, we consider ways in which the
   resource could be further utilized and evaluated, for example as part of
   a flipped classroom approach to learning, and whether this would be a
   useful model to use when teaching other aspects of Child and Adolescent
   Psychiatry.},

Abstract = {Objective: To 1. implement flipped classroom rheumatology teaching for
   undergraduate education. 2. Evaluate outcomes of teaching using OSCE
   assessment and student perceived effectiveness and satisfaction survey.
   Methods: The flipped classroom education, 55-students, was conducted in
   3 phases. Phase 1: Carried out in the students' own time. Web links were
   emailed to assist exposure of the instructional part of the lesson
   online. Phase 2: Interactive in-class activity to share personal
   reflection and reinforce the key aspects. Phase 3: A simulated OSCE
   assessment. A cohort of 56-students, who were taught in the last
   educational year on the same topics according to standard teaching
   protocols, were included as control group. The clinical Outcomes were
   assessed using the scores of the OSCE examination model. Academic
   outcomes included the engagement measure as well as the students'
   answers to perceived effectiveness and satisfaction survey.
   Results: There was no significant difference regarding demographics
   between the 2 students' groups. There was a significant improvement
   (p<0.05) in the flipped learning, in contrast to the control group, in
   terms of clinical (OSCE score) as well as communication skills. Student
   perceived effectiveness and satisfaction was significantly higher among
   the flipped learning (p<0.05). Scores from the flipped learning cohort
   showed a state of engagement significantly higher than the control group
   (p<0.01).
   Conclusion: Flipped learning implementation musculoskeletal learning
   successfully demonstrated a promising platform for using technology to
   make better use of the students' time, and for increasing their
   satisfaction. Active learning increases student engagement and can lead
   to improved retention of knowledge.},

Title = {Introducing First-Year Medical Students to Radiology: Implementation and
   Impact},
Journal = {ACADEMIC RADIOLOGY},
Year = {2018},
Volume = {25},
Number = {6},
Pages = {780-788},
Month = {JUN},
Abstract = {Rationale and Objectives: The aims of our study were (1) to describe a
   new educational intervention for first-year medical students that gave a
   substantial, early exposure to radiology and (2) to examine how this
   early exposure was received by the students.
   Materials and Methods: Our new curriculum incorporated a new 2-week
   course very early in the M1 year entitled Foundations of Diagnostics and
   Therapeutics. Among other topics, the course included a substantial
   introduction to radiology primarily through small-group seminars and
   online materials, administered using a flipped-classroom approach. The
   students were given pre- and postcourse surveys that assessed the degree
   to which they felt prepared to learn about radiology, as well as their
   interest in radiology. Results were analyzed using the Wilcoxon
   signed-rank test.
   Results: Survey responses were obtained from 170 students before the
   course and 65 students afterward. Upon completing the course, students
   showed significantly increased academic interest in radiology (P = .008)
   and a heightened perception of the effect of radiology on patient care
   (P = .04), without a significant change in interest in pursuing
   radiology as a career. Students showed an overwhelmingly Dositive
   response to the course, although some noted that previous anatomy
   training would have been helpful. Eighty percent agreed Dr strongly
   agreed that the flipped-classroom structure was an effective educational
   model.
   Conclusions: Our study demonstrated that students were very excited to
   gain exposure to radiology early in their medical school curiculum and
   such exposure led to an improved peroeption of the field.},

Month = {APR},
Abstract = {This paper aims to quantify the effects of flipped classrooms in higher
   education by reviewing 43 empirical studies of students' cognitive,
   affective, and interpersonal outcomes. The innovative pedagogy of a
   flipped classroom in higher education fosters a sustainable,
   interactive, and student-centered learning environment (as opposed to
   the traditional lecture style, in which there is little room for
   interaction). This study's results show the positive effects of flipped
   classrooms and highlight the improvement in students' educational
   outcomes between 2012 and 2017. Overall, effect sizes were medium-effect
   size (ES) = 0.35, 95\% confidence interval (CI) = 0.24 to 0.47-across
   three outcome domains using a random effects model. In the outcomes,
   affective (ES = 0.59), interpersonal (ES = 0.53), and cognitive (ES =
   0.24) domains were of a higher order than the effect sizes. However, the
   results indicated that flipped classrooms benefitted students studying
   chemistry, engineering, mathematics, and physics less than they did
   students studying other subjects.},

Abstract = {The flipped classroom (FC) is a pedagogical model that transfers the
   work of certain learning processes outside the classroom. In this
   context, Gaming and interactive evaluation in media management learning
   environments (PIGE-On) is an innovation project based on the development
   of a simulation game applied in a first-year Media Business course of
   the Bachelor's Degree in Journalism at the Complutense University of
   Madrid. Using a scientific methodology and a deductive writing model,
   this study explains the didactic foundations of the proposal and its
   effects, among them the learning outcomes as reflected in the assessment

Abstract = {This is the previous phase of an action research carried out in the
   classroom of a higher education program in Sports Sciences at the
   University Escuela Nacional del Deporte in Cali, Valle del Cauca, aiming
   to diagnose prevalent situations in the traditional class and pedagogic
   innovation background, mediated by the teaching technique Flipped
   Classroom (FC), so to seek a better understanding of classwork actuality
   and students' perception of the teaching-learning process (TL). A
   convenience sample of a non-probabilistic nature was composed by 142
   students (35F - 107M) from the Theory and Methodology of Sports Training
   course, whose data, analyzed from the quantitative paradigm, was
   gathered as follows: sociodemographic characteristics of the group,
   Learning Style (CHEA), virtual space use (CEUEV) and satisfaction degree
   in front of the TL process. The findings show a classroom consisting of
   young people of the Millenium Generation, digital natives for whom
   technology is essential, with a Theoretical-Pragmatic Learning Style and
   Use of the Virtual Search and Research Space, immersed in a
   traditionalist pedagogical environment (master class), marked by a
   process of TL that denotes, among other situations, poor student-teacher
   and peer communication. These findings, which are diagnostic, will guide
   the professor researcher's search, towards the improvement of the TL
   process, using the Flipped Classroom, an innovative educational
   technique, according to pedagogical, technological and social needs
   detected in the group, so to increase, as an achievement, the gap
   between traditionalist model and new possibilities of actively
   participating in the TL process in higher education.},

Abstract = {Flipped Classroom (FC) is a blended learning approach being promoted in
   higher education in recent years. It flips the conventional pedagogic
   arrangement so that students use the out-of-class time to conduct
   lower-order learning and the in-class time to conduct higher-order
   learning. Nevertheless, unlike the adoption phenomena in other academic
   disciplines such as Science, Engineering, Medicine and Education in
   university teaching, the adoption of FC in Social Science has been rare.
   This paper reports on a quantitative study (n=152) in which the Stages
   of Concern model was employed to probe into the concerns of Social
   Science faculty members (SSFMs) about introducing FC into their teaching
   practice. The study reveals that the participants were having strong
   categorical concerns of Information and Management. The findings shed
   light on designing more precise interventions for addressing SSFMs'
   actual needs when flipping their classrooms, providing a useful
   reference for researchers and practitioners who are pursuing work on
   promoting FC in higher education.},

Abstract = {Background: This report describes the creation, implementation, and
   evaluation of an inter-professional pharmacy student-led pharmacology
   course for physical therapy students. The course was designed using a
   flipped classroom model and a peer-assisted learning framework.
   Interprofessional education activity: We describe the development,
   design, assessment, and evaluation of a pharmacy student-led
   pharmacology course for physical therapy students. This report focuses
   specifically on the interprofessional aspect of the course, which was
   measured using the student perceptions of physician-pharmacist
   interprofessional clinical education (SPICE) instrument.
   Discussion: The SPICE instrument was measured across two cohorts in 2015
   and 2016. Each cohort consisted of approximately 50 physical therapy
   students. After implementation of the course, there were significant
   improvements across all three domains of the SPICE instrument:
   interprofessional teamwork, roles/responsibilities for collaborative
   practice, and patient outcomes from collaborative practice (P < .01).
   Qualitative feedback from the physical therapy students and pharmacy
   student teaching assistants was positive and emphasized the benefits of
   interprofessional peer teaching.},

Abstract = {Process Control is a course that needs a thorough understanding of how
   the different unit operations work and what are the implications of
   changing operation variables in a process. This paper presents how
   education innovation can help students to improve their learning and
   understanding of the different concepts and thus to get better results
   in the subject and to achieve the desired outcomes. The Process Control
   Course is taught in the Bachelor Degree in Chemical Engineering at the
   Technical University of Madrid. Different methodologies have been
   integrated and used in the course as: flipped classroom, peer
   instruction or gamification. In order to implement the mentioned
   methods, the following material has been developed: screencasts, concept
   tests, trivia contest and simulations besides the traditional lecturing
   material (slides and text). First year results show high student
   motivation, higher participation in class and better results (marks) in
   the subject. (C) 2018 Institution of Chemical Engineers. Published by

Title = {Investigating factors affecting learning satisfaction and perceived
   learning in flipped classrooms: the mediating effect of interaction},
Journal = {INTERACTIVE LEARNING ENVIRONMENTS},
Abstract = {The study investigated the relationships among quality dimensions, three
   types of interactions (i.e. learner-content, learner-instructor, and
   learner-learner interaction), perceived learning and learning
   satisfaction with flipped courses in the context of the flipped
   classroom based on the information system (IS) success model. In this
   study, the quality dimensions in the original IS success model were
   replaced by flipped learning platform quality, instructional video
   content quality, and teaching quality (i.e. instructor monitoring and
   instructor facilitation). The data from 70 participants were analyzed
   using partial least squares structural equation modeling. The results
   indicate that all the quality dimensions have the influences on both
   learning satisfaction with flipped courses and perceived learning
   through the mediation of learner-content interaction or
   learner-instructor interaction. Moreover, learner-learner interaction
   significantly influences perceived learning, but not learning
   satisfaction with flipped courses. Finally, a positive and direct link
   between perceived learning and learning satisfaction with flipped
   courses was found.},

Abstract = {Process control is a relatively young field, with commercial PID-type
   controllers developed largely in the 1930's. Initial publications were
   applications-focused and authored primarily by instrumentation and
   control vendors. While some chemical engineering departments had
   instrumentation and control courses by the 1940's, process control
   textbooks with a theoretical basis did not appear until the mid-1950's,
   yet by 1950 there was already a concern about a theory vs. practice
   ``gap.{''} Evolving views on this gap are discussed, and course content,
   delivery and textbooks used during the past 75 years are reviewed.
   The focus then turns to a flipped classroom, where students view
   screencasts, read textbook material and take an on-line quiz before
   class, which has been implemented in a process dynamics and control
   course. The class periods involve brief lectures summarizing what they
   have studied, and include discussions and advanced problem solving using
   MATLAB and Simulink. (C) 2019 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.},

Abstract = {Although seminal literature indicates that ``chalk and talk{''} is still
   the predominant lecture method (Watts and Becker, 2008; Watts and
   Schaur, 2011; Ongeri, 2017), research more specific to millennials
   (Carrasco-Gallego, 2017; Leinberger, 2015; Litzenberg, 2010; Morreale
   and Staley, 2016) indicates multiple challenges for economics
   instructors who are teaching millennials; it suggests instructors need
   to adapt their teaching methods. They especially point out that
   millennials have a different skillset than previous student cohorts.
   Recently, multiple new teaching methods have been proposed in the
   economics literature. This paper reviews and discusses the most
   effective teaching methods specifically targeting millennials. New
   teaching methods clearly focus on the inclusion of popular culture and
   media, which are already a salient part of the day-to-day life of
   students. Improving students' engagement appears to be a paramount
   objective in the recent literature. Examples of methods reviewed in this
   papers are flipped classroom, student-crafted economics experiments, and
   the use of social media as a medium of instruction.},

Title = {Interpreting log data through the lens of learning design: Second-order
   predictors and their relations with learning outcomes in flipped
   classrooms},
Journal = {COMPUTERS \& EDUCATION},
Year = {2021},
Volume = {168},
Month = {JUL},
Abstract = {Flipped classrooms supported by learning management systems (LMS) have
   been widely adopted by educational institutions. However, earlier
   studies have found problems with interpreting LMS log data to understand
   student approaches to learning within the context of a learning design.
   This study investigates whether it is possible to use LMS log data as a
   proxy to understand students' learning strategies over different periods
   of time in the flipped-classroom context. A total of 135 sophomores from
   two classes of a flipped programming course participated in this study.
   Exploratory factor analysis is first conducted on the log data to
   synthesize second-order predictors based on the total-effort model.
   Then, we investigate the extent to which these second-order predictors
   relate to students' learning outcomes over time. Four types of learning
   outcomes are considered, including a quiz, a midterm exam, a final exam
   and the final grade. For each type of learning outcome, multiple linear
   regression is used to construct a weekly prediction model from these
   predictors. Adjusted R-squared and RMSE (Root Mean Square Error) are the
   metrics used to compare the models. The results show that consistent
   second-order predictors can be derived from log data, implying that
   students' clicking events in LMS could manifest students' learning
   strategies understandable in the design context of a flipped classroom.
   Furthermore, compared with the first-order models, most of the models
   constructed using the second-order predictors have higher predictive
   performance, although with lower data fitness. In addition, the
   predictive performance of the models with MSLQ (Motivated Strategies for
   Learning Questionnaire) indicators and past assessment data are also
   examined. It is found that MSQL variables have a positive but
   short-termed effect on the models' predictive ability, while past
   assessment data greatly improve the models of all types of learning
   outcomes. Theoretical contributions and implications of the proposed
   approach for practice, research and future research are discussed.},

Abstract = {Introduction: The World Health Organization's (WHO) Basic Emergency Care
   Course (BEC) is a five day, inperson course covering basic assessment
   and life-saving interventions. We developed two novel adjuncts for the
   WHO BEC: a suite of clinical cases (BEC-Cases) to simulate patient care
   and a mobile phone application (BEC-App) for reference. The purpose was
   to determine whether the use of these educational adjuncts in a flipped
   classroom approach improves knowledge acquisition and retention among
   healthcare workers in a low-resource setting.
   Methods: We conducted a prospective, cohort study from October 2017
   through February 2018 at two district hospitals in the Pwani Region of
   Tanzania. Descriptive statistics, Fisher's exact t-tests, and Wilcoxon
   ranked-sum tests were used to examine whether the use of these adjuncts
   resulted in improved learner knowledge. Participants were enrolled based
   on location into two arms; Arm 1 received the BEC course and Arm 2
   received the BEC-Cases and BEC-App in addition to the BEC course. Both
   Arms were tested before and after the BEC course, as well as a 7-month
   follow-up exam. All participants were invited to focus groups on the
   course and adjuncts.
   Results: A total of 24 participants were included, 12 (50\%) of whom
   were followed to completion. Mean pre-test scores in Arm 1 (50\%) were
   similar to Arm 2 (53\%) (p=0.52). Both arms had improved test scores
   after the BEC Course Arm 1 (74\%) and Arm 2 (87\%), (p=0.03). At 7-month
   follow-up, though with significant participant loss to follow up, Arm 1
   had a mean follow-up exam score of 66\%, and Arm 2, 74\%.
   Discussion: Implementation of flipped classroom educational adjuncts for
   the WHO BEC course is feasible and may improve healthcare worker
   learning in low resource settings. Our focus- group feedback suggest
   that the course and adjuncts are user friendly and culturally
   appropriate.},

Title = {Pedagogical practice and students' perceptions of fully online flipped
   instruction during COVID-19},
Journal = {OXFORD REVIEW OF EDUCATION},
Abstract = {With courses being moved online because of COVID-19, there is a need for
   exploring innovative and effective online teaching models. This article
   firstly introduces the pedagogical practice of the fully online flipped
   instruction (FOFI), an adaptation of the flipped classroom approach that
   is employed completely online, which has been adopted for EFL
   undergraduates in China during COVID-19 based on video conferencing and
   prior experience in Small Private Online Course (SPOC)-based flipped
   classrooms. A questionnaire and two focus group discussions were
   conducted to investigate students' perceptions of this model. The data
   were collected and analysed quantitatively and qualitatively, which
   reveal their positive perception concerning teacher instruction, varied
   interaction, and multifunctional platforms. However, less motivated
   students hold contrasting opinions on learning platforms and online
   interaction. This study also demonstrates that students' interests,
   self-regulation, and learning environment significantly affect learner
   experience and learning outcomes. The implications for the
   implementation of FOFI are further discussed.},

Abstract = {The lecture has been a core pedagogical method since the early days of
   formal medical education. Although approaches to formal lectures have
   evolved over the years, there has been ongoing debate about the role
   that lectures should play in modern medical education. Arguably,
   traditional lectures do not align well with modern learning theory, and
   do not take full advantage of our current knowledge of how people learn.
   In many modern medical curricula, lectures have been replaced by
   self-study activities, including video-based lectures, computer-based
   learning modules, and other self-directed learning. We argue that
   scheduled together time is still important, particularly in neurology
   education, where there is a strong emphasis on clinical reasoning. We
   outline alternative teaching methods that effectively use this time,
   including the flipped classroom, just-in-time teaching, problem-based
   learning, and team-based learning. We discuss ways in which these
   approaches may be particularly conducive to components of neurology
   education.},

Abstract = {Online courses are gaining popularity because they provide extensive and
   varied course material, information, knowledge, and skills, whilst also
   creating an effective educational online community. This research adopts
   a case study approach to focus on the teaching method and the manner in
   which a strategic commitment to eLearning provides scope for the
   development and implementation of top quality educational online fully
   accredited programs. Entrepreneurship focuses on developing businesses
   that add value and create wealth and prosperity in our societies.
   Therefore, entrepreneurship is a key area of learning for graduate
   students seeking to set up and operate their own SME organizations. It
   can serve as a benchmark for the teaching of other graduate subjects
   that require a sound correlation for the correlation of concepts and
   theories to the challenging complexities of the real world. The program
   was developed on the basis of the implementation of a state-of-the-art
   eLearning platform that allowed for a combination of varied
   self-learning and collaborative learning elements and activities within
   a single platform. This enabled students to access the online content
   material efficiently and effectively. It allows for the development of a
   program based on the flipped classroom teaching methodology. The
   underlying concept of the flipped classroom methodology is that
   effective eLearning should comprise both synchronous and asynchronous
   learning activities. This combination of self-learning and collaborative
   learning calls for careful planning by the tutor to ensure that the
   learning objectives are clearly defined for each activity and that the
   relevant deliverables are monitored. The content material for each
   subject course module was designed, developed, produced, and presented
   by the different project partners in a holistic manner structured to
   motivate participants to learn. The results of our analysis have shown
   that students were able to learn, discuss their projects, and cooperate
   during an online course in an effective and participant-focused manner
   with their tutors. The feedback given highlights the importance of
   ongoing communications between students and the tutors who often need to
   act as mentors to retain student engagement.},

Abstract = {This study sought to probe the effect of two non-conventional
   instructions namely Flipped Classroom Model (FCM) vs. Unplugged
   Classroom Model (UCM) on Iranian EFL learners' oral proficiency.
   Therefore, 90 upper-intermediates were randomly assigned to two
   experimental groups and one control group (30 each). The FCM and UCM
   participants were equipped with WhatsApp online platform and
   conversation-driven, emergent-based instructions respectively. Their
   counterparts in control group received textbook instruction. After four
   weeks of instruction, learners' performances were evaluated using a
   mixed method design with interviews and paper-based exams' posttests
   besides the Community of Inquiry (Cot) questionnaire and the
   instructor's observations for the non-conventional classrooms. The
   results indicated that both FCM and UCM instructions were successfully
   implemented for promoting learners' oral proficiency. However, learners
   reported divergent perspectives that may help the EFL teachers to
   develop FCM and UCM not only for enhancing oral proficiency but also for
   expanding learners' problem-solving techniques.},

Title = {An interactive and blended learning model for engineering education},
Journal = {JOURNAL OF COMPUTERS IN EDUCATION},

Abstract = {Higher education has been undergoing a global transformation since the
   1990s, resulting in changes, induced and modulated by several factors.
   The most important of those changes include the significant
   technological development of the Internet and handheld devices, along
   with the growing demand for educational program assessments by
   accreditation bodies and funding/government agencies. The involvement of
   third-party resources (e.g., book publishers) and technology (e.g.,
   interactive SMART Board) have induced further positive influences within
   higher education and advanced the learning experience to the next level.
   These factors and others have inspired many innovative teaching
   proposals to improve the learning experience and to engage students in
   class more effectively. This article proposes an interactive learning
   approach for teaching engineering curriculum. The proposed teaching
   model takes advantage of the blended learning approach in the form of
   flipped classrooms to complement the learning experience in engineering
   design courses. The flipped classroom is focused on moving some
   components of the traditional face-to-face lecture out of class. With a
   flipped classroom, students can prepare for class by interacting with
   provided resources to reduce lecture time and allow more engagement in
   class. This work also demonstrates how to apply constructivism and
   conversation theories to enhance learning in a blended learning
   environment. The teaching method is carried out by developing an
   interactive module for each lecture and a mini-lecture video, which is
   provided to review materials before class or as a lecture recording.
   Each lecture module consists of pre-class brainstorming questions, a
   lecture theory, and of practice exercises, which are arranged in a
   series of guided instructional solution steps. The lecture module will
   be delivered to students using interactive presentation software that
   engages students in class activities. The effectiveness of this teaching
   method is demonstrated through a quantitative assessment of program
   learning outcomes (PLO) before and after applying the method. Assessment
   of learning outcomes indicates an average improvement from 3.9 to 4.4 on
   a scale of 1-5.},

Abstract = {Traditional lectures are not effective for teaching practical subjects.
   Therefore, it is important to develop a sufficient methodology to
   provide the conceptual and practical aspects of a course to the
   students. In this paper, we describe the challenges faced in the
   implementation of active learning methods in the subject of Data
   Communication \& Computer Network in vocational education at the Federal
   Institute of Brasilia. The experiences resulted in a blended
   methodology, which combines collaborative and problem-based learning
   with a learning management system. The flipped classroom was also
   applied in order to enhance the quality of the references used by the
   students in the solutions. In addition, traditional apps and social
   networks were used to improve the communication between students and
   teachers. The practical activities were applied in a small computer
   network laboratory, but in the first semester of 2016 it was improved,
   and a new high performance Datacentre was built. Thus, interdisciplinary
   aspects and research were explored including the relationship between
   vocational and graduate courses. Moreover, transversal skills, such as
   teamwork, leadership, self-confidence and autonomy in decision-making
   were developed. The research was conducted from 2011 to 2016, and 147
   students were enrolled with an average of 14 students per class. Such
   features demonstrate that the learning methodology must be fit for the
   course and the educational level in order to become effective.},

Abstract = {The lockdown has imposed a systemic shift online of fundamental
   activities, such as work, education and interpersonal communication. In
   particular, remote working has shown advantages in reducing office
   management costs and has stimulated a rethinking in the relationship
   between home and work. In this scenario, we want to reflect on two
   possible aspects: one relating to the reinterpretation of the offices
   from the perspective of the flipped workspace, deriving from the
   didactic model of the flipped classroom in the school sector; the other
   related to the reconfiguration of homes, which acquire a public-private
   dimension with interchange-filter areas.},

Abstract = {Effective delivery of continuing education programs can improve their
   impact. Using the first of four two-week modules of a professional short
   course, we tested outcomes of a flipped classroom approach, comparing
   professional foresters' completion rates, preference for, and perceived
   value of pre-module content delivered via video and reading.
   Participants in the National Advanced Silviculture Program self-reported
   significantly higher pre-module completion rates, preference for, and
   perceived value of video over reading. This simple study suggests the
   potential for video to serve as an accessible and preferred format for

Abstract = {Purpose
   To begin to quantify and understand the use of the flipped classroom
   (FC)-a progressive, effective, curricular model-in internal medicine
   (IM) education in relation to residency program and program director
   (PD) characteristics.
   Method
   The authors conducted a survey that included the Flipped Classroom
   Perception Instrument (FCPI) in 2015 regarding programs' use and PDs'
   perceptions of the FC model.
   Results
   Among the 368 IM residency programs, PDs at 227 (61.7\%) responded to
   the survey and 206 (56.0\%) completed the FCPI. Regarding how often
   programs used the FC model, 34 of the 206 PDs (16.5\%) reported
   ``never{''}; 44 (21.4\%) reported ``very rarely{''}; another 44 (21.4\%)
   reported ``somewhat rarely{''}; 59 (28.6\%) reported ``sometimes{''}; 16
   (7.8\%) reported ``somewhat often{''}; and 9 (4.4\%) reported ``very
   often.{''} The mean FCPI score (standard deviation {[}SD]) for the
   in-class application factor (4.11 {[}0.68]) was higher (i.e., more
   favorable) than for the preclass activity factor (3.94 {[}0.65])
   (P<.001). FC perceptions (mean {[}SD]) were higher among younger PDs (<=
   50 years, 4.12 {[}0.62]; > 50 years, 3.94 {[}0.61]; P=.04) and women
   compared with men (4.28 {[}0.56] vs. 3.91 {[}0.62]; P < .001). PDs with
   better perceptions of FCs had higher odds of using FCs (odds ratio,
   4.768; P<.001).
   Conclusions
   Most IM programs use the FC model at least to some extent, and PDs
   prefer the interactive in-class components over the independent preclass
   activities. PDs who are women and younger perceived the model more
   favorably.},

Abstract = {The evidence-based practice (EBP) approach to high-quality care is
   designed to improve patient outcomes. However, little research has been
   conducted to determine how EBP is adopted and implemented among school
   nurses in Taiwan. This study evaluated an EBP training program
   implemented among school nurses in Taiwan to determine whether and how
   effectively it improved their knowledge levels, attitudes, skills, and
   self-efficacy. A pretest-posttest research design was employed.
   Participants were recruited via convenience sampling from among 193
   primary schools throughout Tao-Yuan and New Taipei City in Taiwan. The
   EBP program implemented both mobile learning technology and the flipped
   classroom format. The learning outcomes were evaluated before,
   immediately after, and at a 3-month follow-up. In this regard, the data
   were collected using the School Nurse Evidence-Based Practice
   Questionnaire. The results showed that the participant scores for the
   items of knowledge and self-efficacy significantly increased over the
   study period. Somewhat differently, scores for the skill items
   significantly increased from the pre-test to the immediate post-test,
   but significantly decreased from the immediate post-test to the final
   follow-up. Overall, however, the EBP program led to marked improvements
   in knowledge, skills, and self-efficacy. These findings can help guide
   the development of a creative evidence-based school nursing curriculum.},

Abstract = {Current literature suggests that students have equal or higher learning

   However, there are few robust analyses of the flipped-class teaching
   method. This research uses a yearlong, quasiexperimental study across
   six sections of a business communication course to track student
   outcomes and perceptions of student engagement and learning. The results
   indicate that there were no significant differences between flipped and
   traditional classes across the learning and engagement variables in how
   students perceived these different conditions. However, the flipped
   condition produced better outcomes for oral and written assignments.},

Abstract = {Pre-class preparedness is critical to students' in-class learning and
   overall success in the flipped classroom. This study used both trace
   data and self-report data to identify students' pre-class learning
   behavior profiles and investigate the relations of the identified
   learning profiles with the achievement trajectory over time and
   students' perceived achievement goal orientations in a flipped
   undergraduate math class. Three distinctive types of pre-class learning
   profiles emerged from the study, including the lecture-focused and low
   time-spent profile, lecture-quiz-balanced and average time-spent
   profile, and quiz-focused and high time-spent profile. The results show
   that students' performance trajectories were significantly different
   among the three learning profiles. In addition, achievement goals
   significantly impacted the membership of the learning profiles,
   indicating students' perceived goal orientations shape their pre-class
   learning behaviors. The theoretical and instructional implications are
   discussed, and specific design suggestions were provided to improve
   students' pre-class preparedness in the flipped math classroom.},

Abstract = {This article examines the integration of cognitive psychology research
   and technology within existing frameworks of statistics course design
   and implementation for a sequence of flipped graduate-level courses.
   Particular focus is the use of the principles of spacing and retrieval
   practice within the flipped classroom format as strategic approaches to
   curriculum design and instructional delivery within and across courses.
   The reporting of student perceptions regarding their engagement in
   learning, statistical thinking and practice, and course components that
   contributed to their learning serves to shed light on ways educators can
   bridge theory to practice in statistics education at the graduate-level.},

Abstract = {Even though the flipped classroom is an increasingly popular method in
   education, a literature search shows a gap in research on this method in
   higher education. This article describes an experiment with two central
   questions: (1) How do students and lecturers assess the effectiveness of
   the FC method? And (2) What are crucial design elements? To be able to
   answer these questions we designed an experiment within a large- size,
   interdisciplinary, course. For three years we carefully monitored and
   evaluated the course. A mixedmethod approach was used to collect data.
   Our findings show a positive contribution of the FC approach to the
   learning experience of students. We also found that a strong link
   between theory and practice is essential in the course design; combined
   with active learning we were able to involve students and stimulate them
   to reach a deeper level of understanding. Moreover, we believe that the
   FC approach offers opportunities to have a large interdisciplinary
   group, with different learning needs, work together on higher attainment
   levels.},

Abstract = {This study investigated how a flipped English as a Foreign Language
   (EFL) classroom incorporating the mobile app LINE impacted college
   students' English performance and their perceptions of this app. The
   study was conducted in a one-semester Freshman English Speaking course
   for non-English majors. An experimental research method was employed,
   utilizing student data from an English Speaking pretest and posttest, a
   questionnaire, and group interviews. Based on a comparative analysis of
   the participants' English-speaking performance between the pre- and
   posttests, the intervention was found to be beneficial. The findings
   also revealed that the English-speaking performance of students who were
   more involved in out-of-class LINE-based activities improved more than
   the performance of those who were less involved. The quantitative and
   qualitative data both highlight that the observed improvements in the
   students' English-speaking performance can be explained by the sociable
   and ubiquitous nature of the LINE app. Pedagogical recommendations to
   fuse LINE-integrated flipped-classroom instruction into their EFL
   curricula more effectively are also provided.},

Abstract = {This paper presents a research study conducted in a specially developed
   laboratory for biometric engineering education. The laboratory gives
   students an opportunity to learn more about fingerprint acquisition and
   analyze the impact of acquisition on other parts of the biometric
   authentication process. An IoT approach was used, as different types of
   sensors (biometric sensors, thermometer, and humidity sensor) and
   components (heaters and workstations) were included in setting up a
   working surface for biometric data acquisition. Working surfaces create
   a network where data collected from each working station is recorded in
   a database. In parallel with biometric data acquisition, environmental
   condition parameters are recorded. Collected data is available to
   students for later analysis through the use of a specially developed
   visualization tool. In order to fully utilize the possibilities the
   laboratory provides, a flipped classroom approach was used. An
   evaluation study was done as a part of the course of Biometric
   technology held at the University of Belgrade. Research results show
   improvements in student learning outcomes and motivation.},

Abstract = {Early childhood trauma can have adverse effects on brain development.
   This results in higher rates of mental health and medical problems in
   adults. Unfortunately, psychiatry trainees are not adequately trained in
   dealing with trauma survivors. Hence, we implemented an online trauma
   curriculum and assessed its efficacy. Socratic methods of teaching,
   flipped classroom approach, brainstorming, role play, and case-based
   discussions were utilized. Participants were able to exhibit good
   knowledge and clinical skills as assessed through summative assessment
   and communication skills assessment. This curriculum showed online
   training can help with clinical skill development along with improving
   knowledge when dealing with trauma survivors.},

Title = {Impact of inquiry interventions on students in e-learning and classroom
   environments using affective computing framework},

Abstract = {Effective teaching strategies improve the students' learning rate within
   academic learning time. Inquiry-based instruction is one of the
   effective teaching strategies used in the classrooms. But these teaching
   strategies are not adapted in other learning environments like
   intelligent tutoring systems, including auto tutors. In this paper, we
   propose an automatic inquiry-based instruction teaching strategy, i.e.,
   inquiry intervention using students' affective states. The proposed
   model contains twomodules: the first module consists of the proposed
   framework for predicting the unobtrusive multi-modal students' affective
   states (teacher-centric attentive and in-attentive states) using the
   facial expressions, hand gestures and body postures. The second module
   consists of the proposed automated inquiry-based instruction teaching
   strategy to compare the learning outcomes with and without inquiry
   intervention using affective state transitions for both an individual
   and a group of students. The proposed system is tested on four different
   learning environments, namely: e-learning, flipped classroom, classroom
   and webinar environments. Unobtrusive recognition of students' affective
   states is performed using deep learning architectures. After
   student-independent tenfold cross-validation, we obtained the students'
   affective state classification accuracy of 77\% and object localization
   accuracy of 81\% using students' faces, hand gestures and body postures.
   The overall experimental results demonstrate that there is a positive
   correlation with r = 0.74 between students' affective states and their
   performance. Proposed inquiry intervention improved the students'
   performance as there is a decrease of 65\%, 43\%, 43\%, and 53\% in
   overall in-attentive affective state instances using the inquiry
   interventions in e-learning, flipped classroom, classroom and webinar
   environments, respectively.},

   following examples of pedagogical mediation: flipped classroom,
   gamification, socio-pedagogical cartography, virtual learning objects
   and Feeling methodology with the pillars of bio-pedagogy, knowledge
   construction, critical thinking and social transformation; the research
   shows the achievement of learning objectives in economics in line with
   the bio-pedagogical vision, using the proposed pedagogical mediation;
   Linking pedagogical innovations based on biopedagogy, allows improving
   the academic objectives proposed for the training of economists.},

   Impacts on students' achievement and perceptions},
Journal = {JOURNAL OF RESEARCH ON TECHNOLOGY IN EDUCATION},
Abstract = {The current research examined the impact of the Student Team Achievement
   Division (STAD, a structured cooperative learning method) and flipped
   learning on improving students' expository writing skills and their
   perceptions about learning. The study was carried out in 11 weeks and
   employed a pretest/posttest quasi-experimental design through which two
   classes were randomly assigned to STAD flipped learning and traditional
   face-to-face situations. The STAD flipped group (N = 24) joined a class
   learning expository writing instructions with STAD principles in a
   flipped classroom whereas their control group counterparts (N = 24) were
   enrolled in a class and received the same expository writing instruction
   in a traditional lecture-based class. The expository essay pretests and
   posttests along with post-treatment for both groups and the
   semi-structured interviews for the experimental group only were used to
   collect data. ANCOVA analyses showed that the intervention significantly
   improved students' expository writing scores through this model of
   teaching. Subsequent analyses demonstrated that the learners had
   positive perceptions and experiences related to the STAD flipped
   learning, instructor support, team support, and personal feelings about
   the course themes.},

Abstract = {Past studies have shown the efficacy of flipped classrooms and
   gamification learning approaches. However, we know little about the
   blend of these learning approaches. This study compares the
   effectiveness of gamified flipped classrooms (GFC) to traditional
   classroom (TC) learning approaches. We study two different undergraduate
   cohorts over six-week course delivery in management and IT in a
   university in UAE. We collected data through an online survey from 105
   students (control and experimental) and performed interviews with two
   focus groups of students. We identified the GFC learning approach as
   more efficient in terms of complexity of the technique, task
   orientation, student engagement, satisfaction, knowledge, and learning
   motivation. We also found a slight difference between the two approaches
   in terms of student skill development. Surprisingly, the control group
   achieved better course learning outcomes through TC than the
   experimental group using GFC because of perceived content relevance. The
   study provides additional evidence on the relevance of employing mixed
   learning approaches in classrooms, not to rely on one approach of
   university lecturers and learning enhancement units solely.},

Abstract = {This study examines the ability of Tourism students to deal with
   customer complaints by using the flipped classroom approach combined
   with the implementation of the online VoiceThread programme. The study
   was carried out with a group of 49 EFL students in the Degree of Tourism
   at the University Complutense of Madrid. The study was carried out in 3
   phases: (1) students were provided with audio material containing some
   useful expressions related to customers' complaints. This material was
   made available on the Virtual Platform (Campus Virtual) so students
   could consult it as they needed before the following class. (2) In the
   computing room, students were asked to listen to a customer complaint
   and to give a solution by recording their own voices. (3) In order to
   gather students' opinions about this experimental activity, students
   were asked to fill in a Google form questionnaire. Overall, the results
   of the study have shown the positive impact of this method on the
   teaching/learning process in the EFL classes for Tourism students,
   contributing to their motivation and development of their professional
   skills.},

Abstract = {This paper synthesizes theory and research on confirmation bias (CB),
   curiosity, and news/information literacy education with the goal of
   understanding how helping students critique their tendency to engage in
   CB spurs curiosity and critical consciousness about learning. Curiosity
   about the self is spurred when people realize their CB tendencies.
   Curiosity about the larger social world is spurred when students learn
   how CB affects the way they look at the world. A flipped classroom
   approach reflects the work of Paulo Freire, who argued critical
   education should be experiential with faculty playing a facilitating,
   rather than an ``expert{''} role.},

Abstract = {The development of a comprehensive set of skills, including technical,
   professional, and technology expertise, is critical to succeeding in the
   increasingly competitive global job marketplace. We proposed to develop
   such skills in our junior students (third year) via a flipped-classroom
   approach, a PO-PBL problem, and interactive e-learning tools. The
   intervention was implemented in the core course of Unit Operations and
   led to an increase in the students' perception of the development of
   teamwork and people-related skills. Despite the benefits of promoting
   student learning, our intervention revealed that we still need to
   conduct work to approach more robust peer-to-peer interactions and
   connectedness. In this regard, students showed a marked tendency to have
   superficial discussions, which reflected their inability to develop
   superior emotional connections with peers. This is critical to promote
   complex thinking and ideation as well as continued engagement with the
   course contents and will be the focus of our future work.

Abstract = {Current social and economic changes have significantly influenced the
   tourism industry worldwide turning it into a diversified sphere of
   activity aimed at servicing tourists and meeting their needs. As tourist
   travels continue to grow throughout the world, they cause extensive
   cross-cultural contacts between different language and cultural groups.
   Thus, higher educational establishments of tourism profile have an
   important task to train competent specialists able to interact
   effectively at the intercultural level. In our article, based on the
   experience of teaching master's degree students majoring in
   international tourism at Lviv Polytechnic National University, we
   analysed possibilities of ICC development in ESP classes by means of
   flipped classroom method, role plays, discussions and a special course
   ``Cross-cultural communication in religious tourism{''} designed by the
   authors. As shown by the results of our study, the methods and resources
   used in our ESP classes may be particularly appropriate for the
   development of students' ICC because they provide the basis for
   intercultural communication, ensure the link between the learning and
   real life and thus make the development of ICC more meaningful to
   learners.},

Title = {Can We Compare Attitude Scores among Diverse Populations? An Exploration
   of Measurement Invariance Testing to Support Valid Comparisons between
   Black Female Students and Their Peers in an Organic Chemistry Course},
Journal = {JOURNAL OF CHEMICAL EDUCATION},
Year = {2019},
Volume = {96},
Number = {11},
Pages = {2371-2382},
Month = {NOV},
Abstract = {Chemistry education research has sought to understand why students
   struggle in organic chemistry courses. Beyond the volume and difficulty
   of the material taught in this course, there are also affective factors,
   such as attitude toward chemistry, that can influence how students
   perform. Studies have documented cases in which students of
   underrepresented minority backgrounds in science fields have less
   positive attitudes than their majority peers. Thus, in this study, we
   investigated whether the significant positive attitude gains found in a
   flipped classroom compared to a traditional lecture course extended to
   the Black female students in the sample when compared to the rest of
   their peers. Our study employs measurement invariance testing, which
   reveals whether an instrument's internal structure holds for different
   groups, to support valid comparisons. The study documents that Black
   female students began the course with lower attitude scores than their
   peers. Results of this study indicate that, while Black female students
   experience similar attitude gains to the rest of their peers in the
   flipped classroom, initial attitude differences are not completely
   erased by this single experience. Our study also uses structural
   equation modeling to describe the relationship between attitude and
   achievement in this flipped organic chemistry classroom. The attitude-
   achievement relationship was successfully modeled by a reciprocal
   causation framework in which emotional satisfaction had a small but
   significant and positive relationship with subsequent achievement
   measures. In light of the observed relationship between attitude and
   achievement, this finding suggests that continued research into both
   attitudinal and achievement factors for students from populations
   underrepresented in the sciences is warranted.},

Abstract = {This communication discusses the dialogical methods of teaching research
   integrity and ethics as a part of the positive integrity trend focused
   on supporting ethical behaviour. The aim of this paper is to offer a
   brief overview of the selected dialogical strategies based on cases that
   can be successfully implemented in teaching ethical research and when
   sharing experiences on good scientific practice. We describe such
   methods as: storytelling, rotatory role playing, and the fishbowl
   debate, along with the ``Dilemma Game{''} tool, ``ConscienceApp{''}
   performance, and a flipped classroom idea. These theoretical
   considerations are based on research conducted as part of a European
   project under the Horizon 2020 programme.},

Abstract = {Point-of-care ultrasound is becoming increasingly utilized in centers
   throughout the country for use in perioperative regional anesthesia
   procedures, vascular access, diagnosis, and resuscitation. We propose an
   educational approach that not only spans the 4-year duration of
   anesthesia residency but also regularly assesses progress throughout
   training. We accomplish this through a flipped classroom model, in which
   the 12 residents in each class participate in online modules for the
   baseline didactic knowledge, then come to a session where they have the
   opportunity to work in small groups (1:2-1:3 ratio of faculty to
   learner) and practice the skills outlined in the modules.},

Abstract = {Many professional development programs aim to improve student outcomes
   by enhancing teacher competencies. Effective evaluation of these
   programs requires a clear delineation of the competencies to be gained.
   A competency model was developed to evaluate the impact of a teacher
   professional program that aimed to improve teachers' ability to
   effectively implement technologically engaged modules in a flipped
   classroom setting. Competencies were identified via participatory
   evaluation techniques and assessments were aligned to the competencies.
   The competency of teachers in the knowledge, skills, and abilities
   needed for creation and delivery of effective flipped lessons can be
   tracked using a radar graph to guide tailored professional development.},

Abstract = {This study aimed to evaluate the effectiveness of online screencast
   video integration through the Quick Response code (QR code) as mobile
   learning (m-learning). In the flipped classroom, the QR code is
   distributed to the students to access the screencast video as a means of
   disseminating lecture notes through their mobile devices. A total of 19
   in-service teachers from Technical Colleges, Teacher Training Institute
   participated in the study. Through this QR code, students can access the
   learning materials before they come to class. Next, in the classroom,
   the lecturer will engage students in collaborative learning activities.
   Thus, in this paper, the researchers discuss about usability testing
   using a five-point Likert scale, through a questionnaire consisting of
   the following four constructs: learnability, efficiency, attitude and
   flexibility. Results from this study showed that the highest mean is
   efficiency. Thus, we can conclude that through the integration of video
   screencast by scanning the QR code, can be a potential tool to support
   the use of m-learning, and also support the blended learning.},

Title = {Role of personality traits in collaborative group works at flipped
   classrooms},
Journal = {CURRENT PSYCHOLOGY},
Abstract = {The Flipped Classroom (FC) approach is an important model for
   individualizing teaching, improving motivation, interaction, and
   increasing academic performance in a student-centered learning
   environment. However, at FC, not all students benefit equally from
   teaching opportunities. There may be important individual differences
   that affect their academic performance. The relationship between
   personality traits and academic performance in the FC model in which
   collaborative group studies are carried out is important for the design
   of individualized learning environments. In this context, the aim of
   this study is to research the relationship between academic success and
   personality traits within a collaborative flipped classroom model.
   Additionally, in this study, the differentiation of the relationship
   between academic success and personality traits according to gender,
   motivation, engagement, and interaction variables were examined. In this
   research, relational screening model was utilized. The application was
   achieved through the participation of 167 students for a 14-week period
   in Turkey. In the research, self-description form and data collection
   instruments were utilized. At the end of this research, Extraversion
   from personality traits is the strongest predictor of academic
   performance in FC. According to descriptive statistics, it was found
   that female students scored higher in FC settings for extraversion, and
   male students had higher scores for openness than other structures. In
   addition, it was found that the motivation scores of women and
   engagement scores of men were prominent. It was observed that the
   openness personality of the students with low motivation and the
   agreeableness of the students with high motivation is more dominant than
   the other personality structures. Students with the low level of
   engagement had the highest openness, and those with high agreeableness
   scores were the highest. The students with the low level of interaction
   had the highest openness scores, while those with high levels of
   interaction had the highest conscientiousness. While personality traits
   and academic achievements of students differed significantly according
   to gender, motivation and interaction levels, no significant difference
   was found according to engagement levels. The results reached in this
   study will guide the applicators about how the students become more
   ready to learn based on the personality traits of the classroom in which
   the FC model was utilized.},

Abstract = {Over the last few years, the School of Information Sciences at Stuttgart
   Media University has profoundly changed those parts of the curriculum
   concerned with information technology competencies and created a
   completely restructured set of modules. These modules are being taught
   in a flipped classroom environment and cover not only topics like
   programming, data structures, data processing or web-based systems but
   also key competencies like how to develop frustration tolerance when
   working with IT, methods for independent learning and working as well as
   general problem solving strategies. This new curriculum has been
   successfully implemented and will be further refined in the new focus
   area ``Data and Information Management{''}.},

Abstract = {In the current digital context, students are increasingly involved by
   digital technologies in their daily lives, which drives their insertion
   in the educational field, at different levels of education, in order to
   make classes more attractive, interesting and dynamic. This research
   aimed to evaluate the contribution of the inverted classroom in the
   construction of knowledge, through the use of self-sufficient digital
   material and metacognitive activity, and to analyze the students'
   perceptions about this methodology as a teaching strategy. The
   self-sufficient study material was created on the Wix platform and made
   available on Facebook. The instruments for data collection were
   pre-activity, post-activity, mind maps produced by students and a
   questionnaire to evaluate the activity. There was a statistically
   significant difference in performance after experience with the inverted
   classroom methodology. Students showed receptivity and interest in using
   digital technologies and inverted classroom methodology in their
   academic life. The academics showed, from their perceptions, that they
   consider the inverted classroom as a methodology that can assist in
   their learning. Such information could be verified in the comparison
   between the results of the pre-activity, with those of the
   post-activity, which demonstrated an advance in learning, enhanced by
   the use of this methodology. Thus, it is possible to evidence the
   contribution of using self-sufficient material based on digital
   technologies, which helped students to assimilate the concepts of
   fibromyalgia, as it offered the content in an organized manner, meeting
   the needs of students.},
