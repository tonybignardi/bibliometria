Abstract = {The 2020 pandemic involving SARS-CoV-2 (COVID-19) resulted in a rapid
   shift to online education for instructors at every level around the
   world. This shift occurred with little training and minimal resources
   available due to the rapidity of onset. In this technology report, we
   describe the use of 3D printing to rapidly manufacture mounts for
   commonly used webcams, which allow them to be pointed downward and serve
   as document cameras for those instructors and students accustomed to
   board-based pedagogical methods. These mounts were designed to connect a
   webcam to a standard laboratory ring stand and could be printed using as
   little as 55 g of plastic (\$1.38 per unit using plastic at \$25.00 per
   1000 g) in about 3 h per mount using default printer settings. The use
   of these mounts allowed a semblance of normality in pedagogy for both
   students and instructors during the rapid shift to online education, and
   this was reflected in student evaluations from a General Chemistry II
   and Organic Chemistry II course where they were utilized.},

Abstract = {In recent years, researchers have worked diligently to identify more
   effective means of facilitating student learning. Some promising
   pedagogical techniques that have emerged include the flipped-class model
   and test-enhanced learning. These pedagogical strategies have been
   incorporated into a multitouch book. A multitouch book is a dynamic
   platform that allows instructors to combine text, videos, interactive
   figures, and quizzes into an electronic book. A multitouch book was
   created and implemented in an organic-chemistry sequence. The course
   content in the multitouch book is divided into individual learning
   units. Each unit contains concise informative text, explanatory videos,
   and quizzes in a structured manner. The multitouch book contains all of
   the topics traditionally covered in a sophomore-level organic-chemistry
   course and was created using a variety of elements to engage students in
   a manner that best matches their learning preference. The multitouch
   book was created in iBooks Author, which has widgets that allow for the
   facile insertion of the videos, figures, irnages, and quizzes. Student
   response to the multitouch book was overwhelmingly positive.},

Abstract = {Ubiquity of information technology is undoubtedly the most substantial
   change to society in the twentieth and twenty-first centuries and has
   resulted in a paradigm shift in how business and social interactions are
   conducted universally. Information dissemination and acquisition is now
   effortless, and the way we visualise information is constantly evolving.
   The face of anatomy education has been altered by the advent of such
   innovation with Technology-Enhanced Learning (TEL) now commonplace in
   modern curricula.
   With the constant development of new computing systems, the temptation
   is to push the boundaries of what can be achieved rather than addressing
   what should be achieved. As with clinical practice, education in
   healthcare should be evidence driven. Learning theory has supplied
   educators with a wealth of information on how to design teaching tools,
   and this should form the bedrock of technology-enhanced educational
   platforms. When analysing resources and assessing if they are fit for
   purpose, the application of pedagogical theory should be explored and
   the degree to which it has been applied should be considered.},

Abstract = {While the benefits of shared note-taking during live lectures have been
   studied, the effects of shared note-taking in e-learning environments
   merit examination since such courses often feature asynchronous video
   lectures, allowing students to work together to construct notes over
   longer periods of time. A study (n=92) was conducted in the context of a
   flipped scientific writing course at a Korean university to investigate
   the effects of collaborative online note-taking on student learning.
   Students in the course were divided into two groups: members of the
   control were simply directed to view course videos and take notes
   individually, and members of the experimental group were asked to take
   collaborative notes in a shared online document. Student learning
   performance was measured through six online quizzes related to the
   course video lectures and through six related individual writing
   assignments. No differences were found in the learning outcomes of the
   control and the collaborative note-taking groups. However, significantly
   higher scores on related online quizzes and individual writing
   assignments were found in groups who took notes actively and for
   individuals who were major contributors to the group notes.},

Abstract = {A key challenge for higher education today is to address the
   expectations of learning that our digital native students have in
   acquiring the required skills to be successful in the workplace within a
   meaningful and engaging context. Flipped classrooms are viewed as a
   teaching pedagogy that can meet these challenges and have been
   implemented across different countries. However, few studies have
   examined the perceived effectiveness of flipped classrooms in different
   cultural settings. The current study investigates the difference in the
   impact of flipped classrooms on five perceived learning outcomes-problem
   solving, critical thinking, teamwork, self-directed learning, and
   knowledge acquisition-for undergraduate business students from Germany
   and the U.S. Hofstede's cultural dimensions are used to hypothesize
   differences in perceived learning outcomes based on cultural values of
   Germany and the U.S. for long-term orientation,
   individualism/collectivism, and uncertainty avoidance. Results show
   differences in perceived learning outcomes attributable to cultural
   differences between German and U.S. students in flipped classrooms.},

Abstract = {This document presents a characterization of the international
   collaborative work on the application of serious game in curricular
   contents of programs in economics related to finance, accounting and
   administration. Information compiled from the Scopus academic database
   during the 2007-2018 observation window was taken as a reference,
   considering bibliometric indicators, outstanding methodologies, trends
   in use or application, and challenges or challenges of implementation.
   As a result, it is possible to identify eight main categories of
   teaching-learning strategies in which Adaptive Learning, Collaborative
   Learning and Gamification are located as the trends in which the use of
   serious games has been consolidated. Storytelling (narrative of
   stories), and Learning based on competencies are in the process of
   consolidation. Finally, flipped learning, Massive Open Online Course
   (MOOC), and Challenge-based learning are incipient lines in which the
   use of serious gaming has not been sufficiently developed. In the same
   way, it is possible to highlight, from the monitoring of scientific
   publications, the main achievements, orientations and challenges of the
   application of these strategies in the classroom; particularly those
   related to finance, administration and accounting.},

Abstract = {The aim of this study was to reveal the research trends in studies on
   educational digital storytelling the to provide an overview the story
   subject area. For this purpose, research data were obtained through
   document analysis. The study was carried out in two stages. In the first
   stage, it was decided on the studies to be examined by scanning the
   literature according to the criteria determined. In the second stage,
   relevant information was extracted from the studies under methodological
   headings and analyzed. The total number of studies were 123 that fit the
   specified criteria and were included in the analysis. In the findings
   obtained from the analysis of the studies, the research trends were
   presented in categories. When the main analysis results were examined,
   it was seen that the most frequently used research method in the studies
   was qualitative and the research design was case study. University level
   as the sample group and foreign language education as the subject area
   were preferred more frequently. Academic achievement, participant
   experiences, attitude, writing skill and motivation variables have been
   prominent variables in studies on digital storytelling.},

Abstract = {The COVID-19 pandemic makes flipped learning more relevant to address
   the challenges of remote learning. Therefore, renewed attention is
   warranted in critically appraising the implications on which flipped
   learning is built. Though several studies have reviewed the flipped
   learning research in the past, the majority has qualitatively
   synthesized the flipped learning literature, thus, lacking the overall
   perspective provided quantitatively for appraising the existing state of
   affairs of flipped learning research in engineering education. This
   study addresses this gap by objectively mapping the conceptual,
   intellectual, and social structure of research development in flipped
   learning using a bibliometric review method. Findings reveal that
   flipped learning in engineering education is a relatively new field of
   research and in recent time it has entered into the stage of exponential
   growth. Findings also show the effectiveness of the flipped learning
   model to address the challenges of complex pedagogical applications in
   different fields of engineering education. This study provides a
   quantitative synopsis of the flipped learning literature which can be
   used as an anchor for future study.},

Abstract = {Different online courses and training programs in Laboratory Animal
   Science (LAS) have emerged across Europe in recent years. E-learning
   appears to be a promising solution to achieve flexibility in training
   while meeting the quality criteria of demanding programs in short
   training periods. However, little is known about how students perceive
   e-learning in this context, and there is also a lack of specific and
   valid instruments to measure this perception. Within an exploratory
   study framework, the e-learning perception of 229 participants in 15
   courses in Portugal using two different online training formats, flipped
   classroom and full online theoretical training, was assessed. For this
   purpose, the Questionnaire of E-learning Acceptance (QELA), a 32-item
   accordance Likert-type scale comprising five subscales was developed to
   explore the following: how participant perceive e-learning, satisfaction
   with organization and contents, perception of e-learning relevance for
   the time management, and its influence for practical training. In
   general, e-learning was well accepted and perceived to work well and be
   useful by the majority of courses participants, independently of the
   course level and e-learning format approach. These results indeed
   suggest that integration of e-learning is useful in LAS training. We
   also propose the QELA as a starting point for development and
   implementation of specific instruments to assess e-learning acceptance
   in LAS across a wider range of geographical and training contexts.
   Resume Differents cours et programmes de formation en ligne ont emerge
   partout en Europe ces dernieres annees en ce qui concerne les sciences
   des animaux de laboratoire (LAS). La formation en ligne semble
   constituer une solution prometteuse pour developper la flexibilite des
   programmes de formation tout en repondant aux criteres de qualite
   exigeants de programmes de formation courts. On ne sait toutefois que
   peu de choses sur la facon dont les etudiants percoivent l'apprentissage
   en ligne dans ce contexte, et il existe peu d'instruments valables et
   specifiques pour mesurer cette perception. Dans un cadre d'etude
   exploratoire, la perception de l'apprentissage en ligne de 229
   participants a 15 cours se deroulant au Portugal en utilisant deux
   differents formats de formation en ligne, a savoir en classe inversee et
   en formation theorique en ligne complete, a ete evaluee. cette fin, le
   questionnaire d'acceptation de l'apprentissage en ligne (QELA), qui
   comprend 32 elements de type Likert et 5 sous-echelles, a ete developpe
   afin d'explorer la perception de la formation en ligne par les
   participants, la satisfaction vis-a-vis de l'organisation et du contenu,
   la perception de la pertinence de la formation en ligne en ce qui
   concerne la gestion du temps et son influence sur la formation pratique.
   En general, l'apprentissage en ligne etait bien accepte et percu comme
   fonctionnant bien, et comme etant utile par la majorite des participants
   aux cours, independamment du niveau du cours et de l'approche adoptee
   quant a la formation en ligne. Ces resultats suggerent en effet que
   l'integration de l'apprentissage en ligne s'avere utile en ce qui
   concerne la formation aux LAS. Nous proposons egalement le QELA comme
   point de depart pour le developpement et la mise en oe uvre
   d'instruments specifiques permettant d'evaluer l'acceptation de
   l'apprentissage en ligne en ce qui concerne les LAS a travers un large
   eventail de regions geographiques et de contextes de formation.
   Abstract In den vergangenen Jahren sind uberall in Europa Online-Kurse
   und Ausbildungsprogramme fur Versuchstierkunde (LAS) erarbeitet worden.
   E-Learning scheint eine vielversprechende Losung zu sein, um
   Flexibilitat in den Trainingsprogrammen zu erreichen und gleichzeitig
   die Qualitatskriterien anspruchsvoller Programme in kurzen
   Ausbildungszeiten zu erfullen. Es ist jedoch wenig daruber bekannt, wie
   die Studierenden E-Learning in diesem Zusammenhang wahrnehmen, und es
   fehlt zudem an konkreten und validen Instrumenten zur Messung dieser
   Wahrnehmung. Im Rahmen einer explorativen Studie wurde die
   E-Learning-Wahrnehmung von 229 Teilnehmern in 15 Kursen in Portugal
   unter Einsatz von zwei verschiedenen Online-Trainingsformaten, dem
   Umgedrehten Unterricht und dem kompletten theoretischen Online-Training,
   bewertet. Zu diesem Zweck wurde der Fragebogen zur Akzeptanz von
   E-Learning (QELA), eine 32 Punkte umfassende Likert-artige Skala mit 5
   Subskalen, entwickelt, um Folgendes zu untersuchen: wie die Teilnehmer
   E-Learning wahrnehmen, die Zufriedenheit mit Durchfuhrung und Inhalt,
   die Wahrnehmung der E-Learning-Relevanz fur das Zeitmanagement und ihr
   Einfluss auf die praktische Ausbildung. Grundsatzlich wurde E-Learning
   von der Mehrheit der Kursteilnehmer gut angenommen und als gut
   funktionierend und nutzlich empfunden, unabhangig von der Kursstufe und
   dem Konzept des E-Learning-Formats. Diese Ergebnisse legen durchaus
   nahe, dass die Integration von E-Learning in die LAS-Schulung sinnvoll
   ist. Wir empfehlen den QELA auch als Grundlage fur Entwicklung und
   Umsetzung konkreter Instrumente zur Bewertung der Akzeptanz von
   E-Learning in LAS in einem breiteren Spektrum von geografischen und
   Ausbildungskontexten.
   Resumen En los ultimos anos, han surgido distintos cursos en linea y
   programas de formacion sobre ciencias de animales de laboratorio (LAS)
   en Europa. El aprendizaje en linea parece ser una solucion prometedora
   para conseguir flexibilidad en los programas de formacion cumpliendo a
   su vez los criterios de calidad de distintos programas exigentes en
   periodos de formacion breves. Sin embargo, no hay mucha informacion
   sobre como los estudiantes perciben la formacion en linea en este
   contexto y tambien existe una falta de instrumentos validos y
   especificos para evaluar esta percepcion. Dentro de un marco de estudio
   exploratorio, se evaluo la percepcion de la formacion en linea de 229
   participantes en 15 cursos en Portugal que utilizaron dos formatos de
   formacion en linea diferentes, aula invertida y formacion teorica en
   linea total. Para este fin, el Cuestionario de Aceptacion de Formacion
   en Linea (QELA), una escala de tipo Likert de 32 elementos de
   conformidad que comprendia 5 subescalas, fue creado para explorar: como
   los participantes perciben el aprendizaje en linea, la satisfaccion con
   la organizacion y contenido, la percepcion de la relevancia del
   aprendizaje en linea para la gestion de tiempo y su influencia para la
   formacion practica. En general, el aprendizaje en linea fue bien
   aceptado y se consideraba satisfactorio y util por la mayoria de los
   participantes de cursos, independientemente del nivel del curso y del
   metodo del formato del aprendizaje en linea. Estos resultados, en
   efecto, sugieren que la integracion de la formacion en linea es de gran
   utilidad para la formacion LAS. Tambien proponemos el QELA como punto de
   partida para desarrollar e implementar instrumentos especificos para
   evaluar la aceptacion del aprendizaje en linea en LAS en una amplia gama
   de contextos geograficos y de formacion.},

Abstract = {Early on, students must develop competences by implementing simple or
   complex electronic circuits with Operational Amplifiers (OpAmps).
   Traditionally, these skills were mainly developed in laboratory classes,
   but technology allows us to explore other and complementary ways of
   aiding students in this achievement. This paper presents a contribution
   to improve the way OpAmps are included in electronic engineering
   courses' curricula. A reconfigurable and expandable kit to teach
   electronic circuits based on the OpAmp uA741 was designed and
   implemented. This kit comprises a software application locally
   interfaced with a hardware platform capable of running in a PC. This
   platform includes a circuit with the OpAmp uA741 able to reconfigure
   according to a set of parameters defined by a software application. Its
   reconfiguration capability also enables the establishment of automatic
   connections for measuring and for applying signals to a reconfigured
   circuit, plus the ability to simulate the same or other OpAmp-based
   circuits. This paper provides an overview about the OpAmp uA741 and its
   relevance in engineering education. After presenting the kit and make
   some considerations for its improvement, at the end a brief discussion
   about its implementation in education according to specific educational
   strategies and methodologies are provided.},

Abstract = {This work has come about as a result of an attempt to improve
   educational practices by taking advantage of research experience in the
   field of additive manufacturing technologies. As a result of the work
   carried out, an open educational resources project was developed by the
   group of educational innovation Ingenieria de Fabricacion of the
   University of Las Palmas de Gran Canaria. It consists of interactive
   teaching material adapted to the new international standards that
   regulate these technologies and includes a methodology for selecting the
   most appropriate technology for the specific application. In this paper,
   we describe the co-creation process that was carried out with students
   in order to develop the resources, as well as a description of the
   didactic material itself together with its interactive elements. An
   analysis of its use in various academic courses is included and also an
   evaluation of its impact, both in teaching a specific subject and in
   other training activities. Our findings indicate that the process has
   led to the production of didactic materials that present content in an
   attractive way and which, in combination with active methodologies,
   noticeably improves students' learning experiences, and is also
   considered a successful experience in open educational practices.},

Title = {Detecting latent topics and trends in educational technologies over four
   decades using structural topic modeling: A retrospective of all volumes
   of Computers \& Education},
Journal = {COMPUTERS \& EDUCATION},

Abstract = {Computers \& Education has been leading the field of computers in
   education for over 40 years, during which time it has developed into a
   well-known journal with significant influences on the educational
   technology research community. Questions such as ``in what research
   topics were the academic community of Computers \& Education
   interested?{''} ``how did such research topics evolve over time?{''} and
   ``what were the main research concerns of its major contributors?{''}
   are important to both the editorial board and readership of Computers \&
   Education. To address these issues, this paper conducted a structural
   topic modeling analysis of 3963 articles published in Computers \&
   Education between 1976 and 2018 bibliometrically. A structural topic
   model was used to profile the research hotspots. By further exploring
   annual topic proportion trends and topic correlations, potential future
   research directions and inter-topic research areas were identified. The
   major research concerns of the publications in Computers \& Education by
   prolific countries/regions were shown and compared. Thus, this work
   provided useful insights and implications, and it could be used as a
   guide for contributors to Computers \& Education.},

Abstract = {During the COVID-19 pandemic, educational institutions were shut down
   all over the world, which impacted over 60\% of students and caused a
   massive disruption of the education system. The goal of this paper was
   to identify the critical success factors for E-learning during COVID-19
   using the multi-criteria Analytic Hierarchy Process (AHP) and Technique
   for Order Preference by Similarity to Ideal Solution (TOPSIS) techniques
   to enhance the educational process. Data were generated by interviewing
   69 E-learning managers in educational institutions during COVID-19 based
   on defined evaluation criteria and E-learning approaches through several
   channels. We found that technology management, support from management,
   increased student awareness to use E-learning systems, and demanding a
   high level of information technology from instructors, students, and
   universities were the most influential factors for E-learning during
   COVID-19. Among the five learning systems, blended learning was the most
   suitable learning system to practice. These results demonstrated that,
   regardless of how extraordinary the technology is in an educational
   institution, the readiness of E-learning execution played a large role
   in boosting the educational process during the COVID-19 pandemic.},

Abstract = {The application of online learning and educational technologies in
   higher education has changed teaching methods, the channels of
   delivering learning materials, and modes of communication between
   teachers and students. This study is aimed to improve learning effects
   and investigate, via quasi-experiments, the effects of web-mediated
   socially-shared regulation of learning (SSRL) and experience-based
   learning (ExBL) on improving students' learning results. The
   experimental design in this study was a 2 (SSRL vs. non-SSRL)x2 (ExBL
   vs. non-ExBL) factorial pretest/post-test design. Four classes in a
   one-semester course titled Applied Information Technology: Data
   Processing at university level were chosen for this study. Based on the
   analysis carried out in this study, students who received the treatments
   of web-mediated SSRL and/or ExBL did not have significantly better
   computing skills in using Excel. The reasons for these insignificances
   and implications thereof are discussed in this paper. Nevertheless,
   students in the SSRL and non-ExBL class had significant increases in
   scores for their learning motivation at the end of semester compared
   with the beginning.},

Abstract = {Actions taken to control the propagation of COVID-19 forced most
   activities to switch into an online environment. Education was no
   exception. In most of the cases the transition turned out well, and
   online education proved to be a good alternative to the traditional
   model. However, in the case of practical courses, the situation is quite
   different because students do not acquire the abilities they would
   obtain by practical experience. A project-based learning (PBL) approach
   has been evaluated at the Chemical Sciences Department of Universidad La
   Salle Mexico as an alternative to practical courses. Two different
   experiences are depicted. Their structure and implications are
   explained, as well as the student and teachers' appreciation. It was
   observed that the strategy showed good results, by demonstrating
   qualitatively that students appropriated the knowledge of the courses,
   and although students struggled to adapt to the work, they were
   motivated. PBL was demonstrated to be effective in developing soft
   skills such as communication, teamwork, and problem and conflict
   solving. Although this approach may not substitute for the practical
   experience, it proved to be a good alternative to instill students with
   abilities that are necessary in the practical field.},

Title = {Influences of Flipped Teaching in Electronics Courses on Students'
   Learning Effectiveness and Strategies},

Abstract = {The potential influence of the COVID-19 pandemic has changed the status
   of school education and further accelerated the revolution of regular
   teaching method. This study compared the learning effectiveness and
   learning strategies of vocational high school students in flipped
   teaching and traditional teaching modes. By adopting flipped teaching on
   an electronics course throughout the entire academic year, this study
   aimed to explore the effect of learning strategies of the students under
   flipped teaching. The subjects of this study were 85 sophomore students
   majoring in Electrical Engineering. This study randomly selected one
   class as the control group (n = 43), and adopted the regular teaching
   method while another class was selected as the experimental group (n =
   42), and employed the flipped teaching method. This study used the
   ``Learning strategy scale of students in vocational high schools{''} as
   the instrument. The students' scores of the Testing Center for
   Technological and Vocational Education Test were used to evaluate their
   learning effectiveness. The results of this study indicate that students
   under the flipped teaching model made remarkable progress in the
   electronics course and the learning outcomes remained significant after
   a long period of time. Moreover, they made notable changes in their
   learning strategies, including ``learning motivation{''}, ``reading and
   exams{''}, ``self-testing{''}, and ``problem solving strategies{''}.},

Title = {Challenges in the online component of blended learning: A systematic
   review},
Journal = {COMPUTERS \& EDUCATION},
Year = {2020},
Volume = {144},
Month = {JAN},
Abstract = {Blended learning is widely regarded as an approach that combines the
   benefits afforded by face-to-face and online learning components.
   However, this approach of combining online with face-to-face
   instructional components have raised concerns over the years. Several
   studies have highlighted the overall challenges of blended learning mode
   of instruction as a whole, but there has been no clear understanding of
   the challenges that exist in the online component of blended learning.
   Thus, a systematic review of literature was conducted with the aim of
   identifying the challenges in the online component of blended learning
   from students, teachers and educational institutions perspectives.
   Self-regulation challenges and challenges in using learning technology
   are the key challenges that students face. Teachers challenges are
   mainly on the use of technology for teaching. Challenges in the
   provision of suitable instructional technology; and effective training
   support to teachers are the main challenges faced by educational
   institutions. This review highlights the need for further investigations
   to address students, teachers and educational institutions challenges in
   blended learning. In addition, we proposed some recommendations for
   future research.},

Title = {Quality design for maritime studies programme in the digital era},
Journal = {MARITIME POLICY \& MANAGEMENT},
Abstract = {Competition among academic institutions for students and Industry 4.0
   have spurred institutions to actively improve undergraduates' learning
   experiences and outcomes. The objectives of this research are to
   identify the quality dimensions of maritime studies programmes from
   students' perspectives and examine their impacts on learning outcomes
   which include satisfaction, engagement, and academic performance. After
   reviewing the literature, six quality dimensions containing 29
   measurement items were generated. An online survey was conducted on
   maritime students from Nanyang Technological University, Singapore.
   Thereafter, exploratory factor analysis and path analysis were used to
   analyse the survey data. The exploratory factor analysis produces a
   six-factor solution that confirms the proposed quality dimensions.
   Further, the quality dimension with the most impact on student
   satisfaction is (1) technology integration, followed by (2) industrial
   exposure, (3) learning and teaching environment, (4) industry-aligned \&
   innovative curriculum, (5) faculty member competencies, and finally (6)
   supporting activities. In addition, student satisfaction positively
   influences engagement and academic performance. Further, engagement
   positively influences academic performance. The developed quality
   dimension model can serve as a measurement tool for maritime
   institutions to assess the quality of their programme and update their
   curriculums respectively to meet students' expectations and learning
   outcomes.},

Abstract = {Grouping students appropriately to increase learning achievement is
   important in learning and teaching. Traditional grouping methods include
   both homogeneous and heterogeneous grouping; heterogeneous grouping has
   been claimed to improve students' learning achievement and learning
   process in both cooperative and collaborative learning. Recently,
   machine-learning-based grouping approaches have been proposed to produce
   better heterogeneous groups. One main drawback of these
   machine-learning-based methods is that they are highly affected by
   parameter settings; setting the appropriate parameters is difficult for
   general users. Consequently, the most adopted heterogeneous grouping
   methods currently are s-shape placement, random assignment, and
   self-grouping, as the three methods do not require additional parameter
   settings. Herein, a new heterogeneous grouping algorithm named MASA
   (magic square-based heterogeneous grouping algorithm) is proposed. As in
   the s-shape placement method, the only parameter required in MASA is the
   number of groups. Experimental analysis on 92 datasets indicated that
   MASA was superior to the s-shape placement, random assignment, and
   self-grouping methods for generating better heterogeneous groups.
   Additionally, MASA is an adaptive method that can generate several
   grouping results simultaneously, and users can select the preferred
   solution. (C) 2019 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.},

Abstract = {Background: Physical distancing required by coronavirus disease 2019
   (COVID-19) has limited traditional in-person resident education. We
   present our novel online curriculum for incorporation into traditional
   surgical educational programs.
   Methods: The online curriculum utilized weekly sub-specialty themed
   faculty and resident created lectures, ABSITE practice questions, and
   weekly sub-specialty synchronized readings. Attendance, resident and
   faculty surveys, and completed ABSITE practice questions evaluated for
   curriculum success. Curriculum was adapted as COVID-19 clinical
   restructuring ended.
   Results: 77\% and 80\% of clinical residents attended faculty lectures
   and resident led topic discussions as compared to 66\% and 48\%
   attending traditional in-person grand rounds and SCORE curriculum (both
   p > 0.05). 71.9\% of residents and 16.6\% of faculty reported improved
   resident participation while none reported decreased levels of
   participation (p < 0.001). 87.1\% of residents and 66.7\% of faculty
   preferred the online curriculum (p = 0.374). Completed ABSITE practice
   questions per resident increased from 21 to 31 questions/week (p =
   0.541).
   Conclusion: Our online educational curriculum demonstrates success and
   can serve as a model for online restructuring of resident education.

Abstract = {In the 21st century, classrooms within institutions of higher education
   are increasingly comprised of first-generation and non-traditional age
   adult students. These students are presented with additional demands
   that can impact their focus and dedication to academic responsibility.
   This article describes specific psychosocial techniques that aided in
   enhanced learning and positive student academic outcomes. The
   psychosocial techniques included principals of clinical psychology with
   an integration of pedagogical and andragogical research tactics and
   coined by the current author, the Cultural Empowerment Teaching
   Andragogy. These techniques are based on an accumulation of strategies
   used at a community college within the City University of New York
   (CUNY) system, a public institution with a diverse student body, and can
   be adapted to be used across institutions and/or disciplines of study.
   CUNY is a university that educates a high population of nontraditional
   students. Techniques used included cognitive empowerment, collaborative
   learning exercises, and testing of the student limits to guide mastery
   of material. This process also aided in empowering them on their overall
   academic journey. Specific student accomplishments included increased
   assignment grades by one grade, improved articulation of classroom
   material, increased confidence in independent oral responses, and
   increased self-esteem as a college student and developing career
   professional.},

Abstract = {Dance courses aim to not only intensify learners' dance skills, but also
   cultivate their personal dancing features, self-confidence,
   self-reflection ability, creative power, appreciation ability, to name
   just a few, in order to attain much higher level artistic performance.
   In the present study, an approach which integrates mobile peer
   assessment into flipped learning is proposed. Moreover, a 9-week
   experiment was conducted to explore the effects of the approach on
   students' dance skills, self-efficacy, and learning satisfaction. The
   results indicated that the students learning with the integrated mobile
   peer assessment and flipped learning approach had better dance skills
   than those learning with the conventional flipped learning approach and
   traditional instruction. In terms of self-efficacy, the students
   learning with the conventional flipped learning approach outperformed
   those learning with the proposed approach and traditional instruction.
   In terms of learning satisfaction, the conventional flipped learning
   approach outperformed the traditional instruction. Discussion and
   suggestions are provided accordingly. It is suggested that teachers who
   want to incorporate flipped learning into dance courses may decide
   whether to combine peer assessment according to the teaching objectives.},

Abstract = {Research into self-regulated learning has traditionally relied upon
   self-reported data. While there is a rich body of literature that has
   extracted invaluable information from such sources, it suffers from a
   number of shortcomings. For instance, it has been shown that surveys
   often provide insight into students' perceptions about learning rather
   than how students actually employ study tactics and learning strategies.
   Accordingly, recent research has sought to assess students' learning
   strategies and, by extension, their self-regulated learning via trace
   data collected from digital learning environments. A number of studies
   have amply demonstrated the ability of educational data mining and
   learning analytics methods to identify patterns indicative of learning
   strategies within trace log data. However, many of these methods are
   limited in their ability to describe and interpret differences between
   extracted latent representations at varying levels of granularity (for
   instance, in terms of the underlying data of student actions and
   behavior). To address this limitation, the present study proposes a new
   methodology whereby interpretable representations of student's
   self-regulating behavior are derived at two theoretically inspired
   levels: that of learning strategies, and the study tactics that compose
   them.},

Abstract = {This study attempted to compare the effectiveness of employing Facebook
   and traditional instruction in improving Iraqi EFL secondary school
   students' vocabulary knowledge. The factors that positively and
   negatively affect the EFL students' vocabulary learning were also
   investigated. The study employed a quasi-experimental design with two
   groups; the control and the experimental groups. In the control group,
   thirty-six students were taught English vocabularies via the in-class
   conventional method, and the experimental group which consisted of
   another thirty-six students were taught using Facebook as an Online
   Learning Platform (FOLP) to enhance their knowledge of English
   vocabularies. A mix of quantitative and qualitative research methodology
   was used where triangulation of pretest, posttest, semi-structured
   interview and observation were used. Results showed that FOLP was more
   effective than traditional instruction in improving EFL students'
   vocabulary knowledge. In addition, results indicated that a variety of
   teaching techniques, effective group work, immediate feedback, and
   autonomous learning opportunities are factors that positively affect
   students' learning of English vocabularies. Moreover, students perceived
   that domination of the good students of the discussion, technical
   problems, and social loafing are the factors that negatively affect
   their learning of English vocabularies. The results confirmed the
   liability of using Facebook in broader contexts.},

Abstract = {This study proposes an innovative blended flipped and online mode for
   PBL-flipped and PBL-online study, a PBL-blended format of instruction.
   The study determines whether different pedagogical strategies -
   PBL-flipped, PBL-online and PBL-blended - influence the validation
   results for the ARCS model and the PBL learning outcomes. The study
   population consists of 116 students who use the general education
   Information and Literacy Ethics digital materials for higher education
   produced by the Ministry of Education in Taiwan. The quantitative and
   qualitative results demonstrate that the paths in the ARCS model are all
   statistically significant for the three methods of instruction and there
   are no significant differences among the three methods of instruction in
   terms of class participation and learning scores. However, there is a
   very noticeable improvement in the PBL learning process in the aspects
   of reliable leadership and group collaboration learning in blended
   groups. Self-directed learning is also enhanced and negative learning
   attitudes are significantly reduced in blended groups. The study
   demonstrates that the proposed PBL-blended teaching mode is a more
   efficient and effective way of promoting PBL learning in information
   literacy courses.},

Abstract = {We describe an advanced, inquiry driven undergraduate course in Cancer
   Biology that combines faculty lectures typical of undergraduate courses
   with literature-driven discussions typical of graduate courses. As a
   capstone course, one goal of this course is to integrate knowledge from
   previous coursework in physiology, cell and molecular biology, genetics,
   and chemistry, so that students acquire a state-of-the-art understanding
   of cancer and cancer treatment. A related goal is for students to learn,
   from the primary literature, how science is performed and how new
   scientific knowledge is used to improve cancer treatment. We report on
   the development of this course and the methods used to accomplish the
   course goals. We present the results of a 5-year survey that provides a
   detailed picture of the demographics of the class and demonstrates that
   the course results in improved understanding of both cancer biology and
   how science is performed. Student responses to our survey strongly
   support the use of original literature as a teaching tool. We suggest
   that incorporation of primary literature into advanced undergraduate
   science courses is an effective approach for improving scientific
   literacy. (c) 2019 International Union of Biochemistry and Molecular

Title = {An exploration of teacher and student perceptions of blended learning in
   four secondary mathematics classrooms},
Journal = {MATHEMATICS EDUCATION RESEARCH JOURNAL},
Abstract = {The COVID-19 pandemic forced many teachers around the world to make a
   sudden switch from face-to-face to online teaching. This shift in
   practice has provided an opportunity to reconsider how technology use in
   mathematics education can be utilised to improve student engagement. In
   this study, we explore four case studies of Australian secondary
   mathematics classrooms conducted prior to the COVID-19 pandemic to
   examine how teachers are using blended learning approaches and how their
   students perceive these pedagogical practices. Findings across all four
   sites indicate that technology use expands student opportunities to
   engage with mathematics learning through the provision of multiple
   pathways and methods of access. Specifically, we find evidence
   supporting the use of blended classroom teaching strategies to provide
   differentiation and personalised learning approaches; visualisation and
   dynamic manipulation of mathematics concepts; and alternative methods
   for teacher-student feedback and communication. We argue that the
   student learning experience in mathematics can be enhanced through a
   variety of blended learning approaches by allowing for diverse points of
   access to learning opportunities which are more closely aligned to
   individual learning needs and free from the temporal constraints of the
   classroom.},

Abstract = {With the development of science and technology, great changes have taken
   place in the way of education. To study the influence of network
   classroom environment on the learning ability of university students,
   one hundred and fifty students from the same major were taken as the
   experimental subjects, and they learned in the traditional classroom
   environment and the rain classroom based network classroom environment
   respectively. Then the academic performance and questionnaire survey of
   the two classes was analyzed. The results showed that the average score
   of the final exam was 77.2 points and 83.2 points respectively in the
   traditional classroom environment and online classroom environment. In
   the network classroom environment, the students had higher performance,
   the number of students who gained high score was larger, and their
   ability of information processing, autonomous learning and collaborative
   learning improved. The experimental results show that the network
   classroom environment has a positive effect on learning ability, which
   makes some contributions to the promotion of network classroom in
   colleges and universities, is beneficial to promote the diversification
   of learning means of students, and provides some new ideas for improving
   the learning ability of university students.},

Abstract = {In recent years, flipped learning has attracted much attention around
   the world. This instructional approach is appealing because it can free
   up class time for knowledge application activities with help from the
   instructor and peers. However, its implementation can be fraught with
   challenges. Student disengagement in out-of-class activities, for
   example, is one of the major challenges of flipped learning. The purpose
   of this study is to examine whether gamification can enhance student
   engagement in a flipped course. A comparison study was conducted,
   involving two classes of undergraduate students in an Information
   Management course. The results indicated that students in the
   gamification-enhanced flipped learning group (n = 48) were more likely
   to complete the preclass and post-class activities on time than those in
   the non-gamified flipped learning group (n = 48). Students in the
   gamification-enhanced flipped learning group also produced higher
   quality artifacts than the non-gamified flipped learning group in the
   pre-class thinking activities. Moreover, students in the
   gamification-enhanced flipped learning group scored significantly higher
   in the post-course test than did their non-gamified counterparts.},

Abstract = {In the generation of those born in a digital environment, devices are
   understood as something natural in the way of obtaining instant
   information. The educational system has adapted and developed new
   pedagogical models, to combine teaching with the intrinsic
   characteristics of digital students. In this scenario, meaningful
   learning provides the educational system with an active model that
   allows the student to associate the new information with the one they
   already have, readjusting and rebuilding both in the process. In this
   context, new technologies act as mediating tools for learning, favoring
   pedagogical practices in teacher-student relationships. The application
   of Information and Communication Technologies promote the acquisition of
   abilities, skills and knowledge for its subsequent professional and
   social application. Thus, the objective of the study was to identify the
   scientific publications related to significant learning and the
   technologies applied in higher education during the period 2000 to 2019.
   A bibliometric analysis of the scientific literature was carried out.
   For this, 1,161 documents on this topic were identified. The results of
   the analysis revealed that scientific productivity has increased since
   2010, verifying the deep interest in new technological resources applied
   to teaching. The main research trends include the impact on students'
   cognitive processes, motivations, and academic performance.},

Title = {Nursing students' perceptions of the efficacy of narrative photography
   as a learning method: A cross-sectional study},
Journal = {NURSING \& HEALTH SCIENCES},
Abstract = {Although active learning methodologies promote students' creativity and
   motivation regarding learning objectives, traditional unidirectional
   teaching methods remain more common. The objective of this study was to
   determine nursing students' perceptions regarding the efficacy of
   narrative photography as a learning method, including self-perceived
   satisfaction. Narrative photography is an art-based technique inspired
   by Photovoice that promotes empathy, creativity, and reflection. A
   cross-sectional study was conducted using a nonprobabilistic sample of
   66 nursing students from a public university in Barcelona, Spain.
   Quantitative and qualitative data were collected anonymously using an
   electronic tool. Descriptive statistics and thematic analyses were used
   to analyze the data. Sixty valid questionnaires were returned. The
   respondents found narrative photography's ability to promote creativity
   and assist understanding of theory to be its most satisfying aspect
   (>95\% somewhat/totally agree). Narrative photography's usefulness,
   ability to foster self-criticism, and the associated workload was the
   least satisfactory aspect (>55\% somewhat/totally agree). Significant
   differences regarding satisfaction levels were found for both age and
   sex. Narrative photography is a helpful and satisfactory learning
   method, especially for promoting creativity and understanding
   theoretical concepts.},

Title = {The learning effects of student-constructed word cards as homework for

Journal = {SYSTEM},

Abstract = {In this quasi-experimental study, an intervention group (n = 50) of
   Taiwanese English as a Foreign Language (EFL) 10th graders were given 18
   weeks of classroom English reading skill-based instruction in addition
   to completing homework requiring construction and review of 100
   vocabulary word cards for unknown words incidentally encountered during
   class reading whereas an equivalent Taiwanese EFL control group of 10th
   graders (n = 50) only received the skill-based instruction. After the
   intervention, significant differences in second language (L2) reading
   proficiency and L2 vocabulary acquisition were shown in favor of the
   intervention group while only a negligible growth in second language
   vocabulary size was shown for both groups. Additional analyses of the
   intervention group's L2 vocabulary size data, responses to an open- and
   closed-ended questionnaire, and the self-constructed word cards revealed
   anomalies in participants' L2 lexicons, a negative reaction to the
   technique of using self-constructed word cards for deliberate vocabulary
   learning, and a need for guidance in selecting target words appropriate
   for their abilities. Pedagogical implications of these and other nuanced
   results are discussed. (C) 2019 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.},

Abstract = {Since the last decade, the use of Information and Communication
   Technologies (ICTs) in Education has been on the rise. Flipped
   classrooms use ICTs as resources in which students use videos to learn
   theories and concepts and the teacher plays the role of a facilitator or
   mediator. This study shows the results of how ICTs were used for a
   Computer Science 1 class by group of students from high school No. 1
   from the public school system in the Mexican state of Hidalgo. The
   subjects of the study included 90 students during the first semester. A
   four-stage research - action methodology was used that included: 1) an
   action plan, 2) development of the action, 3) observation of the action
   and 4) reflection. Three didactic situations involving Computer Science
   were designed, developed and assessed to strengthen the use of
   Technology using the Schoology educational platform, Apple Clips, Movie
   Maker and YouTube. Finding reveal that 92\% of the students preferred
   flipped class compared to traditional classes. Only 8\% preferred the
   traditional system. Technology helped maintain the attention of the
   students, particularly when the teacher used recorded video of the class
   to better understand the subject matter. As a result, student approval
   towards the subject also increased.},

Month = {JUN},
Abstract = {The article presents the reference framework for multidisciplinary
   research at the Life Quality Research Centre (LQRC). The research
   paradigm about the citizens' quality of life in society imposes a
   multifaceted and complex analysis. At the LQRC we address this as
   thematically divided into six scientific areas: education and training;
   physical activity and healthy lifestyles; food production and technology
   on food behaviors; organizational dynamics; motor behavior; and
   individual and community health. These areas are clearly related to the
   concept of quality of life. They fit the goals and dynamics of the
   research center. In each section, the authors develop the themes of
   research projects and the challenges that characterize research in the
   area of quality of life. It is clear that there is an agreement and
   understanding that ensures that quality of life research is on the
   agenda of the world organizations related to scientific research and
   human development. This is a real challenge for scientific research
   centers, since multidisciplinary paradigms are the foundation of our
   collective organization, and the evolution of research on quality of
   life could fulfil current needs and lead to the improvement of citizen
   lives.},

Abstract = {Despite recent interest in online learning, systematic comparisons of
   online learning environments with traditional classroom environments are
   limited, particularly in the sciences. Here, we report on a systematic
   comparison of an online and face-to-face classroom for a
   sophomore-level, lecture-only introductory inorganic chemistry course
   that is designed for students pursuing a chemistry major or minor. The
   online group consisted of three sections of students enrolled in
   Introduction to Inorganic Chemistry during two 8 week summer terms and
   one 4 week winter term. The face-to-face group consisted of two sections
   of students enrolled in Introduction to Inorganic Chemistry during two
   15 week semesters. Both groups of students completed ten common exam
   questions, and a validated and reliable measure of their attitudes
   toward chemistry (Attitude toward the Subject of Chemistry Inventory
   Version 2: ASCIv2). Students in the online course and face-to-face
   course did not differ in their performance on the common exam questions,
   course grade distribution, or attitudes toward chemistry. Although few
   studies have compared online and face-to-face learning environments in
   the physical sciences, our results are consistent with the idea that
   students who complete an online course fare just as well as those who
   attend face-to-face classes.},

Abstract = {A broad range of approaches to learning such as traditional lectures,
   laboratory learning, online learning, and active learning are used in
   higher education settings. Specifically, in the field of science and
   technology, laboratory learning is crucial and a form of active
   learning. The objective of this study was to examine the use of these
   four different learning approaches in a third-year, undergraduate Food
   Science and Technology subject to facilitate learning, where previously
   only traditional lectures and laboratory learning had been used. Two new
   learning approaches, online learning and active learning in class, were
   incorporated, replacing two-thirds of the traditional lectures. Student
   perspectives and preference to these four learning approaches were
   recorded using an online survey. Hands-on laboratory classes were
   selected by the majority of students as the most effective way they
   learned, and also their most preferred learning approach. Majority of
   the students also found that the use of an educational technology, a
   polling tool contributed to their active learning in class. Finally, the
   intended learning outcome of an activity should be carefully considered
   when applying a learning approach to facilitate learning.},

Abstract = {Background. The recent application of blended educational methods has
   impacted medical education and has drawn attention to a new teaching
   method. This teaching style presents unique opportunities and
   challenges. We investigated the effects of blended learning and
   traditional teaching methods on clinical skill development.
   Methods. We sorted 200 medical students from Tongji Medical College at
   Huazhong University of Science and Technology into a control or
   experimental group. The control group was taught with a traditional
   lecture-based learning method and the experimental group was taught
   using a blended learning method. The two groups were compared after
   training to assess their theoretical and practical differences. A
   student satisfaction survey was given to participants in both groups.
   Results. The results of the experimental group's theoretical and
   practical assessments were found to be significantly higher (p < 0.05)
   than that of the control group. The student satisfaction survey showed
   that blended learning was significantly more effective for acquiring
   relevant knowledge, enhancing student-centered learning and improving
   clinical practice.
   Conclusions. Blended learning may address deficiencies in clinical
   skills, make up for limited time and space, and ensure learning
   efficiency and quality.},

Abstract = {One of the leading problems of teaching is maintaining the students'
   motivation for learning. In the current epidemiological situation,
   improvement of education quality using digital platforms and educational
   services by creating conditions for increasing the learning motivation
   of students is an essential and relevant task. Therefore, the aim of the
   research was to study the motivation of the educational activity of
   junior students during the COVID-19 lockdown period and the development
   of effective approaches to increase the learning motivation of students
   in the context of distance learning using the Microsoft Teams platform.
   Research methods: Theoretical analysis of psychological and pedagogical
   literature, generalization; experiment, questioning, testing and data
   processing methods. In total, 107 undergraduates took part in the study.
   The difficulties and benefits that students encountered during the
   lockdown, as well as the attitude of students to the distance learning
   format, were revealed. There were specified dominant motivators,
   intentions and motives that determine the educational activity of
   students. We have presented approaches to the content management of the
   educational process in a distance format, with various ways and
   techniques of increasing the educational motivation of students under
   the conditions of distance learning.},

Abstract = {Over the past two years, the pandemic caused by the COVID-19 virus has
   put to the test all spheres of life not only in Bulgaria but also
   worldwide. It can be claimed that the educational sector has acted
   adequately and has been able to deal with the challenge. The article
   presents research on the implementation of various e-learning tools by
   Bulgarian and foreign universities. The research was conducted at the
   beginning of the pandemic caused by COVID-19 by surveying students and
   lecturers. It turns out that despite the plethora of e-learning tools,
   at many universities, even in technologically advanced countries such as
   China, in most cases, education is delivered through distance learning
   and course management systems, for instance Moodle. The research
   objective is to ascertain the degree of implementation of various
   e-learning tools at Bulgarian and foreign universities. The research
   subject is the degree of implementation of e-learning tools, whereas the
   research object is students and lecturers from Bulgarian and foreign
   universities. The hypothesis, which is proven, is that the
   implementation of diverse e-learning tools is insufficient, despite the
   fact that their importance is acknowledged at all levels of learning and
   teaching.},

Title = {Enhancing students' written production in English through flipped

Abstract = {Today, learning is perceived as a challenge that must be faced
   simultaneously on numerous fronts. Indeed, learning is no longer
   confined to the classroom. Students have the opportunity to learn inside
   and outside the classroom walls. Technology plays its part, as does the
   abundance of information available on social networks and in the mass
   media. Educators must stay abreast of change as information and
   potentially useful technological resources leave traditional education
   behind. Optimising class time through new methods, techniques and
   resources is paramount in today's education systems. This paper presents
   the results of a quantitative study of students' written production in
   English. The English writing skills of engineering students were
   developed using situational (or class) simulations and a large-scale
   web-based simulation in real time. Quantitative analysis of students'
   written production was used to test for differences between experimental
   and control groups. The goal of this study was to show that
   simulation-based instruction contributes significantly to students'
   progress in written production in English. The results showed that
   students who received simulation-based instruction (experimental group)
   significantly improved their English writing skills, primarily in terms
   of organisation and linking of ideas more than students who attended a
   regular English course (control group).},

Abstract = {The flipped approach has been widely adopted in higher education, yet
   its theoretical framework and use in teacher preparation courses have
   been limited. To address these gaps, this study examined the impact of
   the First Principles of Instruction when applied to designing
   face-to-face and flipped technology integration courses. Participants
   were 32 preservice teachers enrolled during the 2017 spring and fall
   semesters. Employing a 3-way mixed factorial research design, we
   measured participants' technological, pedagogical, content knowledge
   (TPACK) outcomes in each group and compared the outcomes between the
   face-to-face and flipped groups. In both groups, preservice teachers'
   self-perceptions and application of TPACK statistically significantly
   increased. The magnitude of the TPACK application results (F2F p < .001,
   d = 1.17; Flipped(a)p < .001, d = 1.97) strongly demonstrates the First
   Principles' potential to frame effective course design. Further analyses
   revealed no statistically significant differences between groups' TPACK
   outcomes. These non-significant differences suggest the First Principles
   of Instruction may be equally effective for designing flipped and
   face-to-face courses. We conclude the article by discussing implications
   for course design and detailing considerations for future research on
   flipped approaches.},

Abstract = {Recent advances in active learning have shown that flipped learning is
   an effective pedagogical approach, but few studies have examined the
   differences between a flipped and non-flipped course across numerous
   semesters with the same instructor teaching both formats. This study
   examines the performance of students in an upper-level space mechanics
   course in flipped and non-flipped settings over seven semesters.
   Students in the flipped course performed better on peer evaluation,
   homework, and exams leading up to the final exam. The course is required
   for all aerospace engineering students who can decide to pursue the
   aeronautics (aircraft) track or the astronautics (spacecraft) track.
   After flipping the course, students in the astronautics track had larger
   gains in performance compared to in the aeronautic track implying that
   the flipped course helped students that could readily perceive how they
   would use the course concepts in the future (astronautics). When
   examining the viewing habits of students in the flipped courses,
   watching more videos was associated with higher grades on course
   elements. Students who watched videos for a longer time and viewed more
   unique videos received higher scores on graded course elements. This
   study implies that flipped learning is a successful pedagogy that
   improves student learning in an upper-level engineering course.},

Abstract = {Social media is in demand now these days; even in learning or teaching
   as a platform to create social presence for active learning, and usage
   of Emojis is a creating such a huge gap in the field of research. The
   study has been documented to investigate the pragmatic approach of
   Emojis in the Whatsapp group of English as second language learner (ESL)
   of Pakistan. The study aims to identify the culturally specific context
   used by Pakistanis speakers which helps to obtain communication through
   emojis in text-based communication. Discussion has been focused on only
   most commonly used three emoji as a sub-topic of researcher's thesis.
   Wow emoji, okay, and Victory has been discussed in the study.
   Methodology has been constructed on Cultural psychological theory in
   qualitative method. The population has been taken from the first-year
   students of Quaid-e-Awam University of Science and Technology,
   Nawabshah, sample unit is 30 partcipants. In the research design,
   screenshots of partipant's chat had been taken for contextual
   analysis.The study supports that expressions are not innate. The study
   is occupied on the exact usage of Emojis which aids teachers and
   learners of modern era to use Emojis for their better understanding in
   social apps},

Abstract = {Flipped instruction has become a hot issue in foreign language teaching
   technology. In this study, we tracked learners in a beginner-level
   Chinese Foreign Language classroom to see if flipped teaching based on a
   MOOC made a difference to their oral proficiency development and rate of
   progresscompared to a baseline group. Language developmentwas assessed
   by standard complexity, accuracy and fluency measures, alongside
   subjective ratings. Learners' investment of time and perceptions of the
   new method were also investigated. Results showed that learners exposed
   to flipped instruction significantly (p < .01) outperformed the baseline
   group in oral proficiency in many measures, especially in speech
   fluency, though their advantage in complexity and accuracy was less
   evident. Rate of progress through the syllabus for the flipped group was
   also faster, requiring 25\% less face-to-face time. Learners in the
   flipped group also demonstrated more (out of class) time investment in
   their learning and more positive attitudes toward the course, though
   these two factors did not significantly associate with the proficiency
   measures. These results support the implementation of flipped
   instruction in foreign language classrooms for both better and faster
   learner improvement; we explore how far psycho-social models of active
   learning might explain its methodological advantages.},

Month = {JUN},
Abstract = {As new informational conditions contribute to the discovery of new ways
   to improve the quality of the educational process, a new integrated
   learning model was elaborated. The purpose of the paper is to evaluate
   the students' engagement in a newly-introduced integrated learning
   model, identify the impact of such a model on students' learning
   outcomes, and to determine if students' engagement levels influence
   their learning outcomes. For our research we used qualitative and
   quantitative data of students' records of professional discipline and
   English testing, surveys and interviews on behavioral engagement,
   emotional engagement, and cognitive engagement (N = 63). Results on
   students' engagement showed that online activity, especially the online
   international project, involved students more than face-to-face classes,
   but at the same time some of them noted that without lectures it would
   be difficult, or even impossible, to participate in a project. Thus the
   overall engagement level was quite high. Additionally, an integrated
   approach positively impacted learners' outcomes. The correlation
   analysis showed that learners' engagement played an influential role and
   highly impacted students' learning results. In this case we can conclude
   that our integrated learning model contributes to students' involvement
   in the educational process and, as a consequence, allows them to achieve
   greater results.},

Abstract = {This study developed a web-based multimedia assessment system (WMA
   system) and applied it to science laboratory instruction. The goal was
   to improve students' knowledge acquisition under science laboratory
   instruction. The developed system enabled learners to perform
   self-assessments by responding to multimedia technology test items
   online. The system recorded each learner's complete answer history and
   provided the students with personalized learning resources. This study
   adopted a quasi-experimental research design. The learning content was
   an ``experiment on separating mixtures.{''} Students participating in
   the research were divided into a typical science laboratory instruction
   group (TI group; n = 25) and a group that received instruction through
   the WMA system (WMA group; n = 26). Before instruction, all the students
   completed the conceptual knowledge and experimental knowledge pretests.
   During instruction, the TI group watched the teacher's demonstration
   experiment, and the students then performed the experiment in a real
   laboratory. In the WMA group, after learning through the WMA system, the
   students also performed the experiment in a real laboratory. After
   instruction, all the students completed the conceptual knowledge and
   experimental knowledge posttests. The findings indicated that the
   students in the WMA group showed significantly higher improvements in
   their scientific conceptual knowledge and experimental knowledge.},

Abstract = {Field-based course work has been foundational to Ecology and
   Evolutionary Biology curricula. However, opportunities for these
   experiences gradually have decreased over the past few decades and are
   being replaced with technology in the college learning environment. The
   coronavirus disease 2019 pandemic facilitated a rapid transition of all
   field-based courses to online only delivery, which we argue has forced
   us to reconsider how to deliver course content to retain field
   experiences in a manner that is safe during the pandemic but robust to
   ever changing constraints in the college classroom. Here, we propose
   pairing an intensive laboratory experience with an otherwise online
   delivery. We discuss several advantages of intensive laboratory
   experiences that occur in the field over a short but intensive time
   period over that of the traditional low-intensity weekly laboratory
   structure. In particular, intensive laboratory experiences are safer
   during the pandemic because they allow the group to be tested and
   isolated, allow more flexibility for students with competing interests
   for their time, and also enhance student interpersonal skills while
   still providing strong reinforcement of the skills typically honed
   through experiential learning. We present case studies for how we intend
   to apply our proposed model to two courses that heavily rely on
   field-based experiential learning to facilitate adoption.},

Abstract = {Teaching and learning innovations in higher learning institutions have
   been radically changed over time to suit the once an agricultural nation
   to a more industrialised society. This change needs to be taken as the
   New Millennium Learners are influenced by advanced information and
   communication technologies. As we aim to achieve a shift towards more
   active learning through innovations, a variety of approaches are
   employed as we make use of digital and physical learning spaces. Blended
   learning that moves away from traditional classroom approaches with a
   more interactive learning is integrated in the teaching and learning
   process. The use of space beyond the conventional classroom setting
   enhances collaboration with peers and teachers from other countries.
   This paper intends to synthesise the innovative teaching and learning
   approaches in Universiti Malaya to accommodate the progressive change of
   the diverse academic community and industry requirements of our
   graduates. It aims to present an overview of the current academia
   learning innovations that have been taking place in the university that
   provide some form of engagement with technology. It also shows how
   instructors and students are supported by the various initiatives,
   approaches and collaborative efforts carried out by the university in
   keeping abreast with technological advancements. Finally several
   implications for teaching and learning in higher education are also
   discussed in this paper.},

Title = {Understanding the antecedents of knowledge sharing behaviour and its

Journal = {AUSTRALASIAN JOURNAL OF EDUCATIONAL TECHNOLOGY},
Year = {2020},
Volume = {36},

Pages = {89-104},
Abstract = {Due to the competitive and rapidly changing nature of the external
   business environment, university students must acquire the ability to
   cooperate, share knowledge, and enhance team effectiveness and learning
   in the workplaces of the future. Consequently, the design of business
   courses in higher education merits further discussion. Based on the
   notions of team-based learning and flipped classrooms, we proposed a
   business course model that consisted of three main phases: before-class,
   in-class, and after-class online course activities. After implementing
   the course models in two business courses at two public universities in
   Taiwan, a survey based on social learning and social exchange theories
   was distributed. The data collected from 218 undergraduate business
   students were analysed. The findings reveal that value in team members'
   contributions is positively associated with team trust and each has a
   significant impact on knowledge sharing and team effectiveness.
   Knowledge sharing played a key role in this learning context and was a
   significant mediator between perceptions of value in team members'
   contributions and team effectiveness, as well as between team trust and
   team effectiveness. In addition, team effectiveness was a benefit to
   individual learning in these classes.},

Abstract = {Popularity of videos for classroom instruction has increased over the
   years due to affordability and user-friendliness of today's digital
   video cameras. This prevalence has led to an increase in flipped, K-12
   classrooms countrywide. However, quantitative data establishing the
   appropriate video length to foster authentic learning is limited,
   particularly in middle-level classrooms. We focus on this aspect of
   video technology in two flipped science classrooms at the middle school
   level to determine the optimal video length to enable learning, increase
   retention and support student motivation. Our results indicate that
   while assessments directly following short videos were slightly higher,
   these findings were not significantly different from scores following
   longer videos. While short-term retention of material did not seem to be
   influenced by video length, longer-term retention for males and students
   with learning disabilities was higher following short videos compared to
   long as assessed on summative assessments. Students self-report that
   they were more engaged, had enhanced focus, and had a perceived higher
   retention of content following shorter videos. This study has important
   implications for student learning, application of content, and the
   development of critical thinking skills. This is particularly paramount
   in an era where content knowledge is just a search engine away.},

Abstract = {Higher education, which has the function of cultivating human capital,
   has already become a key focus of developed countries around the world.
   From ministries of education to higher education institutions, many
   bodies are dedicated to enhancing student learning outcomes. However,
   social and educational problems derived from disadvantaged groups have
   long been hindering the development of individuals and the whole
   country. This study examines the learning motivations of economically
   disadvantaged versus non-disadvantaged college students and evaluates
   the relationship between learning modes and learning outcomes from a
   self-determination theory (SDT) perspective. In this study, 817 valid
   questionnaires were collected to compare the two sample groups in terms
   of learning path. The results show that non-economically disadvantaged
   students have superior outcomes compared to disadvantaged students in
   terms of role identity, academic identity, explorative learning,
   exploitative learning, and cognitive and non-cognitive gains. In regard
   to path analysis, economically disadvantaged students are significantly
   superior to non-disadvantaged students in the face of positive influence
   of academic identity on different learning modes and positive influence
   of explorative learning on cognitive and non-cognitive gains. Finally,
   based on the conclusions, this study proposes some suggestions specific
   to theoretical mode for future study.},

Abstract = {Over the last couple of years, new teaching methods have been developed
   and implemented in German universities, but only rarely in dental
   schools. The aim of this project therefore was to implement students'
   requests for such methods to be used in dental education. In 2012, based
   on an analysis of both quantitative and qualitative requirements, we
   designed a questionnaire for quantitative analysis, and evaluated a
   series of lectures on oral and maxillofacial surgery. Based on our
   findings, we then designed a blended learning module that was gradually
   integrated into the series. In 2017 we again evaluated the lectures, and
   rated the module. The two evaluations were then compared using a
   two-sample z-test. The results showed that students were very satisfied
   with the approach. They were particularly happy with the surgical
   videos, which were shown during the lectures and also included in the
   module, as they helped them to understand the surgical technique. Our
   survey showed that most of the students were using the online learning
   program and that it was the resource they preferred. Application of a
   blended learning approach could satisfy the requirements of the new
   generation of students, and transform traditional lectures into modern,
   sustainable, and technology-enhanced learning experiences. (C) 2018 The

Abstract = {This study incorporated technology action puzzle and obstacle challenge
   activities in the course design. Using the 921 Earthquake in Taiwan as
   the theme, this study integrated the content of various subjects and
   course modules and applied information technology to present the
   humanistic care elements. The subjects of this study were Grade 9
   students of a public middle school in central Taiwan. After the
   interactive operation introduction and theme film viewing, the students
   were divided into groups to participate in the technology action puzzle
   and obstacle challenge activities. Students' learning performance using
   smart technological tools and overall course feedback were evaluated
   from the aspects of building structure safety knowledge, disaster
   prevention and mitigation, integrated interdisciplinary thinking, and
   problem-solving abilities through the course planning and
   quasi-experimental design. The results show that (1) in terms of the
   learning achievement scale, the pre-test and post-test of paired samples
   reached statistical significance; (2) in terms of the learning response
   scale, the mean of the Likert five-point scale reached above 4.0; (3)
   the results of mediating regression analysis show that, compared with
   the traditional classroom teaching mode, the interactive teaching
   experience and technology action puzzle have a mediating effect on
   learning performance and overall course feedback.},

Abstract = {The change in higher education caused of ICT have a clear reflection on
   the methodologies in the university classroom. The technological
   opportunities and of the easy access to the Internet and information
   allows both teachers and students to share spaces of the university as
   ubiquitous environments, facilitating e-learning and blended learning.
   Social networks such as Facebook, Youtube and other social networks have
   arrival to the university classroom, both individually and in groups. We
   present in this paper the results of study whose aim has sought to
   identify collaborative methodologies in Web 2.0 from the universities of
   Cadiz, Huelva and Seville. We use a quantitative and qualitative mixed
   method based on a survey which was responded by 537 students from
   universities under study. Moreover, it was developed a Focus Group at
   each university under study, which involved 20 teachers. The results
   show that collaborative methodologies in university are highly regarded
   among team members and between them and teachers. However, these
   collaborative methodologies in Web 2.0 are not used and are hardly used
   through Web 2.0 tools. In the same direction it is shown that both
   teachers and university students consider social networks as excellent
   for collaboration among students and between students and teachers
   themselves.},

Title = {Social media as a student response system: new evidence on learning
   impact},
Journal = {RESEARCH IN LEARNING TECHNOLOGY},
Year = {2018},
Volume = {26},
Abstract = {The ubiquitousness of social media renders it a potentially powerful
   tool in higher education. This study explores the use of Twitter as a
   tool to enhance active learning and improve feedback during large-sized
   lectures. Students in a final-year undergraduate accounting course at an
   Australian university engaged in Twitter-based synchronous activities,
   including answering in-lecture quizzes and posting questions. This study
   explores two key questions: (1) `what encourages students to actively
   utilise social media in their learning process?' and (2) `what
   pedagogical advantages are offered by social media in enhancing
   students' learning experiences?' Results of a student survey
   administered at the end of the course show that (1) students are more
   likely to participate in in-lecture Twitter activities if they are
   familiar with the technology, (2) Twitter activities encourage students
   to participate in active learning, (3) Twitter provides a platform
   enabling two-way student-instructor communication and (4) students find
   Twitter activities helpful regardless of whether they attend the lecture
   in real time or view online lecture recordings. These findings deepen
   our understanding of the pedagogical benefits of using Twitter as a
   student response system, which will assist educators to better harness
   the power of social media in the learning-teaching process.},

Abstract = {In higher education, one commonly used teaching approach that is
   intended to develop deep learning is that of the `Oxford' tutorial-a
   personalized Socratic approach in which an instructor discusses
   course-related issues with a handful of students. Even though this
   conventional tutorial model is well supported in the literature, it may
   be neglected by research-driven academics and is expensive to operate.
   The latter issue has placed tutorials in the spotlight because higher
   education institutions are facing huge funding cuts worldwide. In light
   of these problems, a scoping review was conducted to explore financially
   viable alternatives to the Oxford tutorial for management education.
   Articles in highly ranked management education and development academic
   journals were collected by searching these catalogs and compiling a
   database of 48 articles published in four premier journals. These
   articles were reviewed by two independent raters in order to arrive at 8
   alternatives to the Oxford tutorial model that can achieve similar
   objectives of said tutorials while reducing costs. These alternative
   tutorial models all involve the application of information communication
   technologies to tutorials and include peer instruction, simulations and
   games, online collaborative learning, syndicates, flipped classrooms,
   communication systems, tailored learning, and portfolios. Challenges and
   implementation guidelines are explained for each alternative tutorial
   model.},

Title = {How Can We Support Students' Learning Experiences in Higher Education?
   Campus Wide Course Transformation Program Systematic Review and
   Meta-Analysis},
Journal = {INNOVATIVE HIGHER EDUCATION},
Abstract = {The aims of this paper are to examine the breadth of scholarship that
   emerged from a large-scale university-wide course transformation program
   between 2011 and 2021, to investigate how the course transformation
   program influenced students' perceptions of their learning environment
   and learning achievement, and to discuss future directions for improving
   autonomy-supportive learning in higher education. We gathered all
   quantitative and qualitative publications related to the IMPACT course
   transformation program, and 35 articles were included in the study.
   Since the scope of the study topics in the course transformation program
   varied and program implementation was applied to various study contexts
   and disciplines, the findings were first summarized in a narrative
   manner. Additionally, a meta-analysis was conducted to examine the
   effectiveness of the course transformation based on 10 journal articles
   that adopted quasi-experimental designs. The findings revealed that the
   courses redesigned through the program supported students' positive
   learning experiences, including motivation, satisfaction regarding basic
   psychological needs, knowledge transferability, and academic
   performance. This paper discusses implications and future directions to
   enhance undergraduate students' academic success through course
   redesign. Further exploration is needed to determine the additional
   effect of course redesign in higher education.},

Title = {Effects of a review video and practice in video-based statistics
   training},
Journal = {COMPUTERS \& EDUCATION},
Year = {2020},
Volume = {143},
Month = {JAN},
Abstract = {This study investigated the effectiveness of video-based statistics
   training. An experiment is reported in which conditions were
   systematically varied for the presence or absence of review videos and
   practice opportunities. Three main types of dependent measures were
   recorded: engagement, motivation, and knowledge. Seventy students
   participated in training and were assessed afterwards. Video play
   measures revealed nearly complete (94.1\%) views for original videos,
   and lower but still substantial views for the review video (60.5\%). The
   results for time spent on the videos were in line with these findings.
   There was no effect of condition on these engagement measures.
   Motivation scores were high for task relevance and self-efficacy.
   Self-efficacy scores were significantly higher when a review video
   and/or practice opportunity was available. Practice scores were
   uniformly high in the two practice conditions. The practice conditions
   scored significantly better than the no-practice conditions on a
   procedural knowledge post-test. There was no difference between
   conditions on a declarative knowledge post-test, nor on a transfer test.
   The conclusion draws attention to the possibility of improving the
   effectiveness of existing video-based statistics training by adding a
   complementary review video and arranging for practice with external
   feedback.},

Title = {Effects of flipping the principles of microeconomics class: Does

Abstract = {Flipping the principles of microeconomics classroom significantly
   improves student-learning outcomes compared to traditionally taught
   lectures; however, it remains unclear as to if the effect differs
   depending upon the spacing and scheduling of class meetings. This paper
   investigates if the quantitative effects of flipping on student outcomes
   differ by scheduling. It further evaluates if student perceptions about
   flipping vary depending on the spacing of class meetings. This paper
   shows that students in flipped classes scored significantly higher on
   final exams compared to those in a traditional setting, and the effect
   of flipping did not vary with class spacing. Students in the flipped
   class setting reported significantly more active learning and were
   significantly more likely to recommend the professor to other students
   than those in a traditional setting; however, those in the flipped class
   that met twice a week for 80 min reported significantly less active
   learning and were significantly less likely to recommend the professor
   than those in the traditional setting. The results documented in this
   study suggest that while the effects of flipping on student learning do
   not vary with class spacing, student satisfaction does differ with
   spacing. Therefore, when considering the scheduling of a flipped course,
   instructors need not worry about the impact of flipping on learning
   outcomes, but they should consider the importance of student
   satisfaction.},

Title = {Modified Blended Learning in Engineering Higher Education during the
   COVID-19 Lockdown-Building Automation Courses Case Study},
Journal = {EDUCATION SCIENCES},
Year = {2020},

Abstract = {The blended learning method with its supporting electronic tools is a
   very well-known approach in academic education. In most of its practical
   applications, direct face to face contacts between students and the
   teacher as well as students with each other in groups are important
   elements in the organization of lectures and classes. This is of
   particular importance in conducting laboratory classes in teaching
   process for engineers. However, the COVID-19 lockdown in the spring of
   2020 closed schools, universities and completely eliminated the
   possibility of direct interpersonal contacts. These extraordinary
   circumstances forced changes in the organization of the teaching
   process, in particular the introduction of distance learning. Therefore,
   this paper proposes a modified blended learning method as well as
   describes a case study on its introduction in the education of building
   automation engineers at a technical university. A new organizational
   structure of this modified method is presented, with discussion of tools
   and methods of active distance learning, introduced during the COVID-19
   lockdown period. Finally, some experiences, general reflections along
   with the identification of the preferred forms of distance learning by
   students are presented. The future works are briefly described as well.},

Title = {Types, purposes, and effectiveness of state-of-the-art technologies for
   second and foreign language learning},
Journal = {COMPUTER ASSISTED LANGUAGE LEARNING},
Abstract = {Digital technologies have been widely used to enhance language learning,
   the effectiveness of which has been acknowledged in the literature. With
   the rapid development of digital devices and technologies, increasing
   technologies have been used in the most recent several years, leading to
   more diversified approaches to language education. This exceptional
   advance over the past few years calls for a summary of state-of-the-art
   technologies that have been used to enhance language learning and
   promote effective learning. The present study was conducted to fill this
   gap by reviewing all the relevant publications in 10 widely recognised
   journals in the field of technology-enhanced language learning. An
   analysis of 57 articles indicated five major types of technology for
   second and foreign language learning (i.e. technologies for mobile
   learning, multimedia learning and socialisation, speech-to-text and
   text-to-speech recognition, and digital-game-based learning). The
   results also showed four primary purposes and benefits of the
   state-of-the-art technologies: promoting practices, delivering
   instructional content, facilitating interactions, and restructuring
   teaching approaches. Moreover, these state-of-the-art technologies have
   been integrated into various aspects of language teaching and learning,
   the overall impact of which has been positive.},

Title = {GeoGebra in mathematics education: a systematic review of journal
   articles published from 2010 to 2020},
Journal = {INTERACTIVE LEARNING ENVIRONMENTS},
Abstract = {This study reviewed papers in the Web of Science database from 2010 to
   2020, which were relevant to the integration of the dynamic geometric
   software, GeoGebra, into mathematics education with a focus on
   publication trends, research methods, participants, application domains,
   learning strategies, and research issues. It was found that there have
   been a limited number of studies on the integration of GeoGebra into
   mathematics education. In terms of research methods, quantitative
   empirical studies accounted for the most, followed by qualitative method
   studies. The majority of studies were carried out in upper secondary
   schools followed by higher institutions, with few carried out in primary
   and lower secondary school mathematics education. Regarding the
   application domain, the majority of studies were focused on geometry and
   analysis topics. Most studies investigated students' learning
   performance, higher order thinking, attitudes/opinions, and perceptions.
   Regarding learning strategies, most studies adopted activity/task-based
   learning strategies to implement GeoGebra. It is worth nothing that
   little or no research was found to investigate students' cognitive load,
   learning anxiety, and engagement. Further suggestions for the future use
   of GeoGebra in mathematics education to improve the learning process and
   learning outcomes as well as potential issues are provided for
   researchers and practitioners.},

Abstract = {At the present time, digital educational technologies are gradually
   being introduced into the sectors of education aimed at the complex
   competencies that combine psychomotor skills and soft skills.
   Particularly, special tactical police training is aimed at the formation
   of specific police skills of tactical progression, disposition,
   communication, as well as decision-making and problem-solving skills.
   Considering the prevailing tendency in post-Soviet countries to use
   traditional apprenticeship in police special tactical training, the most
   justified is the implementation of the concept of cognitive
   apprenticeship. This concept, on the one hand, allows to create such
   complex police skills for an unpredictable, chaotic workplace
   environment, as decision-making and problem-solving, and on the other
   hand, is based on the teaching experience accumulated by instructors.
   The important outcome of the orientation of police training on soft
   skills by the above approaches is the satisfaction of students. In this
   regard, the study examines the levels of academic satisfaction from
   traditional, blended, and distance learning. Distance learning was
   implemented during quarantine due to the Covid-19 pandemic. The study
   found a higher degree of the students` satisfaction with blended
   learning than satisfaction with face-to-face and satisfaction with
   distance learning.},

Abstract = {Improved access to higher education can reduce social and economic
   inequality only if universities achieve equality in graduation rates of
   different groups of students. Concerned about first year failures among
   first-generation students, a university in Chile devised a
   between-semesters course intended to allow failed students to remain
   with their entering class. The course had three major elements:
   compression of a semester's course work into 2 weeks; use of incentives
   to motivate students to prepare for classes; and ``flipped class{''}
   participation. In 2014, this intensive course was offered in the break
   between the first and second semesters. Some 310 students in Health
   Sciences who had failed at least one of three required courses were
   invited to enroll; 140 signed up. At the end of the course, more than
   90\% of the students taking the intensive course passed the regular
   final examination they had previously failed and continued with their
   entering class. With no additional intervention, over the next seven
   semesters, students who had taken the intensive course performed as well
   in their courses as those who had not and were less likely to drop out.
   In 2017, more than 75\% were still with their class, compared with 53\%
   of those who had not taken the course.},

Title = {Identifying differential benefits from a flipped-group pedagogy in
   introductory microeconomics},
Journal = {INTERNATIONAL REVIEW OF ECONOMICS EDUCATION},
Year = {2019},
Volume = {30},
Month = {JAN},
Abstract = {A growing literature documents the potential for benefits to be realized
   from non-traditional pedagogical approaches to teaching introductory
   economics at the undergraduate level. However, increased interest in and
   justification of the use of more engaged pedagogy that blends in class
   and online learning to reach a new and diverse generation of college
   students makes it imperative that we, as instructors, understand who is
   best served by such teaching innovations. In this paper, I present
   student outcome results from an informal post hoc experiment conducted
   over four semesters in which an Introductory Economics course is taught
   in its entirety three times over two semesters using traditional lecture
   methods and then three times over two subsequent semesters using a
   flipped-group pedagogy. In the latter, approximately 70\% of class time
   is devoted to completion of graded in-class group assignments and the
   majority of content is delivered out of class through a series of
   publicly available videos. Results from the analysis indicate that in
   this particular context, the benefits of the flipped-grouped classroom
   pedagogy were not distributed equally. Specifically, while students with
   more developed math literacy and non-minority students benefited from
   the flipped pedagogy as evidenced by higher performance on the third
   semester exam and, to a lesser extent, on the averaged semester exams,
   the flipped format had a negative impact on weaker and minority
   students.},

Title = {Evaluating Learning Space Designs for Flipped and Collaborative
   Learning: A Transactional Distance Approach},
Journal = {EDUCATION SCIENCES},
Year = {2021},
Volume = {11},
Number = {6},
Month = {JUN},
Abstract = {Problem-based learning is the latest name for a teaching philosophy that
   is as old as Ancient Greece. Whether you call it Socratic Inquiry,
   case-based teaching, problem-based learning, interactive group learning,
   or ``flipped{''} learning, the essential concept is to encourage the
   student to collaborate in applying their gained knowledge to solve a
   problem. As traditional lecture-based teaching has been challenged, the
   design of classrooms has been called into question. A flat or tiered
   room is not seen as an ideal setting for collaborative work. In our own
   College of Business, several traditional classrooms were converted to
   problem-based learning classrooms at considerable expense. This paper
   evaluates, using measures based on Michael G. Moore's theory of
   transactional distance, whether moving flipped classes into these
   high-tech classrooms improves the collaborative learning experience.
   Transactional distance can be defined as the barriers that exist to a
   student's engagement with their learning experience. These barriers
   arise due to the interaction between students and the teacher, other
   students, the subject matter content, and instructional technology being
   used. Our results suggest that, from a student engagement and outcome
   standpoint, the investment in costly high-tech classrooms is not
   warranted-a welcome result in times when university budgets are
   stretched to the limit.},

Title = {Self-regulated learning support in flipped learning videos enhances
   learning outcomes},
Journal = {COMPUTERS \& EDUCATION},
Year = {2020},
Volume = {158},
Month = {DEC},
Abstract = {In flipped learning, students study learning material before class and
   apply the content of the learning material during class. This requires
   self-regulated learning (SRL) behavior due to the increased autonomy in
   this instructional approach. Providing students with video-embedded SRL
   support (i.e., prompts and explicit instruction) during the learning
   activities before class has proven to be an effective strategy in
   primary and higher education to enhance students' SRL and learning
   outcomes. The current study aims to replicate the effects of SRL support
   in a Flipped class in secondary education over the course of eight
   weeks. In total, 115 eighth-grade students from five classes
   participated in a quasi-experimental study, which measured the effects
   of SRL support on students' SRL (self-reports and online activities),
   learning outcomes, and satisfaction. We found a positive effect of SRL
   support on learning outcomes, but we could not explain this by
   differences in students' SRL. Although all the students were generally
   positive about the flipped learning environment, some students clearly
   disliked the SRL instruction. We conclude that SRL support is beneficial
   for students' learning but that it should be carefully designed to avoid
   students' dissatisfaction, which could potentially nullify these
   beneficial effects on learning.},

   gamification: An empirical study},
Journal = {COMPUTERS \& EDUCATION},

Abstract = {We evaluated the use of gamification to facilitate a student-centered
   learning environment within an undergraduate Year 2 Personal and
   Professional Development (PPD) course, In addition to face-to-face
   classroom practices, an information technology-based gamified system
   with a range of online learning activities was presented to students as
   support material. The implementation of the gamified course lasted two
   academic terms. The subsequent evaluation from a cohort of 136 students
   indicated that student performance was significantly higher among those
   who participated in the gamified system than in those who engaged with
   the nongamified, traditional delivery, while behavioral engagement in
   online learning activities was positively related to course performance,
   after controlling for gender, attendance, and Year 1 PPD performance.
   Two interesting phenomena appeared when we examined the influence of
   student background: female students participated significantly more in
   online learning activities than male students, and students with jobs
   engaged significantly more in online learning activities than students
   without jobs. The gamified course design advocated in this work may have
   significant implications for educators who wish to develop engaging
   technology-mediated learning environments that enhance students'
   learning, or for a broader base of professionals who wish to engage a
   population of potential users, such as managers engaging employees or
   marketers engaging customers.},

Title = {Silver linings: A thematic analysis of case studies describing advances
   in health professions education during the Covid-19 pandemic},
Journal = {MEDICAL TEACHER},
Abstract = {Purpose In addition to the damaging public health, social and economic
   effects of COVID-19, health professions faculty around the world have
   faced staggering upheaval in the education of their students and junior
   doctors. Despite the formidable challenges, some silver linings have
   emerged in health professions education. The paper aims to describe
   themes from reflections of international health professions educators on
   these silver linings using an appreciative inquiry framework. Materials
   and methods We performed a qualitative analysis of written reflections
   from a group of 115 international educators from medicine, nursing,
   dentistry, and the allied health professions describing a personal
   experience with an educational approach or work strategy arising during
   the COVID-19 pandemic that should be sustained. Results We identified 13
   thematic units of reflections regarding advances in health professions
   education during the pandemic. The most notably optimistic and
   pioneering were Advancement of the Profession, Professional Connections,
   and Accelerating Change. Other frequent themes included unexpected
   successes in Virtual Teaching and Clinical Teaching. Conclusion Several
   points of optimism from this otherwise catastrophic world event have
   emerged. This analysis serves as a useful guide for further research to
   understand, sustain and promote positive changes during a global
   pandemic on health professions education.},

Title = {Exploring the differences between gamer and non-gamer students in the
   effects of gamification on their motivation and learning},
Journal = {INTERACTIVE LEARNING ENVIRONMENTS},
Abstract = {Studies have shown that the application of gamification has positive
   effects on motivation and learning. However, various meta-studies
   indicate that there is high volatility in the published results. The
   purpose of this study is to analyze whether the student's activity as
   gamers is related to these differences. A comparative study was
   conducted with undergraduates' students in a database course. Students
   were divided into two instructional approaches: flipped learning (n =
   47), and flipped with gamification (n = 49). Gamers were identified in
   each class using three methods: game frequency, spending money on
   videogames and most played game genre. The results showed that students
   in gamified class obtained significantly better results in learning, but
   there were no differences in motivation and satisfaction. When comparing
   gamers with non-gamers in the gamified class, the results using the
   three methods coincide with respect to motivation but show differences
   in satisfaction and learning. In the same way, when the effects of
   gamification on non-gamers were analyzed, there are coincidences in
   which those of the gamified class have better performance, but there are
   no coincidences regarding motivation and satisfaction. The results
   obtained show that the conclusions when comparing between gamers and
   non-gamers depend on the method used to identify them.},

   Numerical Concepts for Flipped Science Education},
Journal = {EDUCATION SCIENCES},
Year = {2019},

Month = {JUN},
Abstract = {In education, the use of information, computers, and the Internet as a
   form of blended technology has been receiving increased attention and
   consideration. Additionally, increasing attention is being paid toward a
   scaffolding mechanism that can be integrated into science classrooms in
   order to solve technological challenges. This work describes a
   computer-based blended and scaffolding learning toolbox to support
   numerical concepts for flipped science education, particularly one which
   is developed and implemented in a MATLAB environment and framed in Adobe
   Captivate 6 as a HTML5-based e-Learning application, which can be used
   for science laboratory exercises. This toolbox, named SciEduFIT, is one
   of the blended and scaffolding learning systems available for use in
   science education. Through this toolbox, students can acquire the skills
   to establish the numerical concepts in a flipped science classroom. A
   survey was conducted to measure the suitability of the proposed toolbox,
   specifically A to E screens of SciEduFIT. The positive results of the
   survey indicate that this novel toolbox should be introduced into
   science classrooms in order to supplement other existing tools currently
   in use in the area of flipped science education. Therefore, the research
   shows a general positive perception of the toolbox and highlights the
   feasibility of the toolbox to achieve significant science learning.},

Title = {Application of Linear Regression Mathematical Model in the Evaluation of
   Teachers' Informatization Quality},
Journal = {COMPLEXITY},
Year = {2021},
Volume = {2021},
Month = {APR 27},
Abstract = {With the widespread application of information technology and the
   continuous deepening of my country's education informatization
   construction, the educational field has increasingly higher requirements
   for teachers' informatization quality. The advancement of the process of
   education informatization depends to a large extent on the level of
   teachers' own level of informatization and has gradually become an
   important indicator to measure the informatization of education. The
   main body of education and the decisive factor are teachers. The
   scientific and reasonable evaluation of informatization education is an
   important content of today's education informatization. This paper uses
   regression analysis to evaluate the teacher education information system
   and uses mathematical statistics to establish a linear regression model
   for the city and analyze and calculate it. Through the quantitative
   analysis of the evaluation index system of the education informatization
   level, the multiple linear regression analysis method was used to
   establish the linear regression mathematical model of the school
   education informatization level on each secondary index, and the
   influence of various indicators on the school education informatization
   level was analyzed to establish a scientific evaluation system to
   evaluate the literacy of teachers' informatization education and to give
   suggestions for improving the level of school education informatization.
   The design of the evaluation system is more scientific and reasonable,
   the regression error is small, the results obtained are more accurate,
   and the impact of nonlinear errors is basically eliminated.},

Abstract = {The irruption of information and communication technologies (ICT) in
   education is a present reality, so it is essential that teachers have an
   adequate level of digital competence in order to deploy innovative
   praxis in their work as teacher. A relevant aspect is the exercise of
   continuous training in technological matters that is carried out to
   improve their digital skills. In all this plays an important role the
   phenomenon of technological leadership that allows a dynamic and
   influence of professionals towards training, inclusion and application
   of innovative resources in learning spaces. The objective of this work
   was to know the incidence of the technological leadership of the
   teachers of the teaching cooperatives of Andalusia (Spain). For this, a
   descriptive and correlational quantitative methodology was applied,
   using as a data collection instrument a questionnaire in a sample of 428
   teachers. Among the results, training deficiencies found in ICT,
   competence inequalities both in the areas of teaching digital skills and
   qualities to deploy technological leadership, which leads to a shortage
   of e-leaders. The teachers reveal that they make a combined use
   (face-to-face and innovative) at the methodological level. Finally,
   differences were found between the sexes, both in the variables taken in
   the leadership and in the different areas that articulate the digital
   competence.},

Abstract = {Undergraduate education is competitive. User experience is important to
   course design because it can improve user-satisfaction and learning.
   Action research methodology was used in our practice-oriented case study
   about the application of human-factors methods to re-design an
   undergraduate second-year occupational therapy course. A cognitive task
   analysis provided an empirical method to develop this framework. A
   mixed-method quality improvement process was undertaken. This was
   influenced by grounded theory to consider the experiences of the
   students and teaching staff. The methods included past curriculum
   review; cognitive task analysis; and seeking feedback from subject
   matter experts, including a student focus group. Six student roles were
   identified for this course: a generalist student, a mock client, a mock
   therapist, an evaluator of standardised assessment tools, a clinical
   documenter, and a case conference presenter. The student roles were
   detailed per nine cognitive components: knowledge, skills, abilities,
   tactics, decision-making, situation awareness, heuristics, interpersonal
   skills, and intrapersonal skills. Ninety-one elements that could
   influence performance were identified by this dissection. A
   student-centred approach to course design provided an empirically sound
   and practical method to determine important aspects: the student
   experience and role demands, effective instructional aids and teaching
   practices, and assessment to support role competence.},

Abstract = {Objectives This study aimed to evaluate the impact of flipped learning
   in faculty development program (FDP) dedicated for developing
   key-feature questions (KFQs), and to compare examinees' success and
   their opinions for the KFQs in a board exam. Methods The study group
   consisted of two cohorts - Pediatric Endocrinology and Diabetes Society
   Board members (n=11) and Pediatric Endocrinology Subspecialty 2019 Board
   Examination examinees (n=22). We used flipped learning approach to
   develop KFQs. This entailed writing KFQs while learning took place
   online. The discussion and refinement of the questions for the exam were
   done during the face-to-face meeting. At the end, feedback was taken
   from both cohorts. Results The faculty members developed 14 KFQs during
   the flipped learning process. They found the training useful (Md=9,
   IQR=1), and expressed high satisfaction (Md=9, IQR=1) for flipped
   learning approach. According to the faculty members, peer review was an
   important step in the flipped learning instructions for revising and
   improving the KFQs. Conclusions A successful intervention of flipped
   learning approach has been tested in a FDP dedicated for KFQ writing.
   During flipped learning, the board (faculty) members were more engaged,
   motivated for self-learning and collaboration, and encouraged for robust
   face-to-face discussions.},

Abstract = {Introduction: Students enrolled in professional pharmacy programs tend
   to have high prior academic achievement. This achievement may be
   predicated on their learning strategies. However, when entering a
   professional program, it is unclear if their strategies change to adopt
   to a new, more rigorous academic environment. The purpose of this
   research note is to document a single cohort of students' learning
   strategies over time within a doctor of pharmacy (PharmD) curriculum.
   Methods: A single cohort from the University of North Carolina at Chapel
   Hill Eshelman School of Pharmacy received yearly surveys regarding their
   learning strategies used during the past academic year. This cohort was
   tracked from prior to the start of the PharmD curriculum throughout the
   three-year duration of didactic course work. The survey was based on
   prior research of learning strategies.
   Results: Most learning strategies remained constant over time including
   the primary strategy of re-reading or re-watching videos. Using
   flashcards and completing practice problems decreased over time. In
   addition, students seem to migrate to cramming for examinations rather
   than spacing their study over time. Similar patterns were noted in the
   small cohort of students that completed all four surveys.
   Conclusions: Primary learning strategies do not seem to change with time
   but some secondary learning strategies may change over time.},

Abstract = {Active learning exercises engage students during lectures, but often
   fail to take account of the individual learning position of each
   student. The `quecture' is a partially flipped lecture that incorporates
   students posing their own questions (quecture questions), discussing
   them during lectures and revisiting them later. These interactive
   learning events are designed to personalise students' construction of
   learning during lectures. Quectures were trialled in direct comparison
   with both fully flipped and traditional lectures, providing information
   on student attitudes, experiences and engagement with the learning
   strategy. Quectures were favoured by participants over the two other
   lecture formats and were found to be helpful both in increasing learning
   and in improving study habits, although some students had difficulty
   adjusting to, or disliked, the new mode of learning. The student-posed
   questions were also perceived by students to improve enquiry skills and
   to personalise learning. Although many chose not to engage with the
   strategy, those who did felt more engaged with, and more responsible for
   their own learning during quectures than in traditional lectures. Future
   work will be required to generalise the effectiveness of this strategy
   as well as to fine tune for optimum benefit. It will also be important
   to investigate which subpopulations of students preferentially engage or
   disengage with the strategy, and to unpick any relationship between this
   engagement and academic performance.},

Abstract = {This study aimed to investigate the effect of flipped classrooms
   integrated with massive open online courses (MOOCs) and game-based
   learning on the learning motivation and learning outcomes of students
   from different backgrounds (in terms of gender, grade, self-confidence
   indicators in mathematics, and roles played in the game-based learning
   process). Surveys and a semi-structured open questionnaire were used for
   data collection, including a basic information questionnaire (to
   understand the participants' backgrounds), a questionnaire on learning
   motivation (the Motivated Strategies for Learning Questionnaire, MSLQ),
   a test of learning achievements in mathematics, and a semi-structured
   open-ended questionnaire (to understand the learners' feelings).
   Quantitative analysis results showed that flipped classrooms integrated
   with MOOCs and game-based learning can enhance students' learning
   motivation and outcomes. Specifically, compared with students with high
   self-confidence in learning mathematics, students with low and medium
   levels of self-confidence showed significantly greater improvement in
   overall learning motivation. Significantly more enhancements were found
   for the expectation component of ``soldiers{''} (students with
   relatively lower learning achievements) than for ``generals{''}
   (students with higher learning achievements). Furthermore, students in
   the eighth grade showed significantly greater progress in academic
   performance than did students in the seventh grade.},

Title = {Pop-up Questions Within Educational Videos: Effects on Students'

Abstract = {Educational videos are increasingly used to let students prepare lesson
   material at home prior to in-class activities in flipped classrooms. The
   main challenge of this teaching strategy is to stimulate students to
   watch these videos attentively before going to class. This paper
   describes the use of questions that pop-up within relatively long
   educational videos of 16 min on average and designed to enhance
   students' engagement and understanding when preparing for in-class
   activities. The effects of such pop-up questions on students' learning
   performance were studied within a flipped course in molecular biology.
   Students had access to videos with or without a variable set of pop-up
   questions. The experimental group with pop-up questions showed
   significantly higher test results compared to the group without pop-up
   questions. Interestingly, students that answered pop-up questions on
   certain concepts did not score better on items testing these specific
   concepts than the control group. These results suggest that merely the
   presence of pop-up questions enhances students' learning. Additional
   data from interviews, surveys, and learning analytics suggest that
   pop-up questions influence viewing behavior, likely by promoting
   engagement. It is concluded that pop-up questions stimulate learning
   when studying videos outside class through an indirect testing effect.},

Abstract = {Mental illness is a major cause of morbidity and mortality in society.
   Undergraduate nursing students designed and implemented a mental health
   awareness campaign called the I Will Help You initiative as part of
   their senior leadership nursing course. The aims of the initiative were
   to: spread awareness on mental illness; give the general public the
   skills and resources needed to identify and assist individuals who are
   struggling with mental illness; and decrease the stigma surrounding
   mental illness. A website, four online educational modules, four social
   media accounts, and two videos were designed by the students in order to
   promote the initiative. One month following the initiative's launch, the
   website had over 4000 page views, the videos had over 20,000 views,
   there were over 200 pledges, and the educational modules had 60 users.
   The initiative received substantial media attention and was featured via
   a variety of platforms including: a local news story, numerous health
   blogs, the state nurses' website and across the university campus. The I
   Will Help You initiative provided real life application of nursing
   leadership to an undergraduate student population while building a
   sustainable, evidence-based tool that can be used as a public health
   resource for mental illness. (C) 2017 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.},

Title = {Learning and Emotional Outcomes after the Application of Invention
   Activities in a Sample of University Students},
Journal = {SUSTAINABILITY},
Year = {2020},
Volume = {12},
Number = {18},
Month = {SEP},
Abstract = {Invention activities can promote reflective learning processes. However,
   their inclusion in educational practice can generate doubts because they
   take up time that can otherwise be invested in explaining content, and
   because some students might experience frustration and anxiety while
   trying to solve them. This study experimentally evaluated the efficacy
   of invention activities in a university statistics class, considering
   both emotions (self-reported) and learning achieved. In total, 43
   students were randomly assigned to either (a) inventing variability
   measures before receiving instruction about the topic of statistical
   variability, or (b) completing a similar problem-solving activity, but
   only after they had received guidance with a worked example concerning
   the target concepts. Students in the first condition acquired greater
   conceptual knowledge, which is an indicator of deep learning. The
   emotions experienced during the learning activities were similar in both
   learning conditions. However, it was notable that enjoyment during the
   invention phase of the invention condition was strongly associated with
   higher achievement. Invention activities are a promising educational
   strategy that require students to play an active role, and can promote
   deep learning. This study also provides implementation guidelines for
   teachers while discussing the possibilities offered by new technologies.},

Abstract = {Hybrid online delivery, which is also referred to as mixed-mode
   delivery, utilizes a combination of online content and traditional
   face-to-face methods which may benefit significantly from specific
   delivery adaptations for undergraduate engineering curricula. Herein, a
   novel eight-step phased instructional flow with several targeted
   adaptations is used to accommodate the mixed-mode delivery of STEM
   curricula is evaluated with a longitudinal study of students afforded
   these adaptations versus those without them. This STEM Blended Delivery
   Protocol (STEM-BDP) emphasizes scaffolding of analytical procedures
   along with hands-on problem solving throughout online and face-to-face
   components equally. Two high enrollment course case studies utilizing
   STEM-BDP are examined herein, including an Electrical and Computer
   Engineering required core undergraduate course and a Mechanical and
   Aerospace Engineering under-graduate course. The details of the STEM-BDP
   delivery strategies, learning activities, and student perceptions
   surveys are presented. Student-resolution longitudinal analysis within a
   controlled study using blinded evaluation indicates that over a
   five-year period, failure rates have decreased by 63\% among students
   undergoing STEM-BDP while control and alternatives have not demonstrated
   similar improvements within the same degree programs. Given increasing
   enrollments within STEM curricula, it is sought to overcome challenges
   of conventional lecture-only delivery in high-enrollment courses.},

Title = {Interactive Large Group Lecture Demonstrations: Dramatization of Medical
   Neurobiology Concepts to Improve Student Perception of Understanding

Abstract = {With the advent of recorded lectures, face-to-face teaching in medical
   school large classroom settings is increasingly under pressure to
   incorporate engaging activities that encourage attendance and can
   translate to greater attainment and long-term retention for learners,
   especially of ``Generation Z{''} learning styles. This places a greater
   onus on lecturers to convey key concepts in a manner that holds value
   beyond their recorded substitute. The present article details several
   on-stage Medical Gross Anatomy and Neurobiology demonstrations that
   involve the teaching of an intuitive understanding of brain fluidic
   mechanics, such as hematoma formation and the protective functions of an
   intact cerebral spinal fluid system (addressing concussion and lumbar
   punctures). These demonstrations can be presented relatively quickly on
   stage and are suitable for engaging large classroom sizes (n>100), which
   can be used in conjunction with traditional lecture formats. Ideally,
   these in-class demonstrations, together with the continued contributions
   of other quantitatively assessed demonstrations from other institutions,
   will help to maintain a growing body of large class face-to-face
   teaching approaches and strategies to help influence decisions regarding
   what basic medical knowledge may best be taught in class live versus by
   recorded substitute or other non-traditional lecture methods.},

   Interface for Observing Pre-Service Teachers' Performance and Motivation},

Abstract = {Sustainable science, technology, engineering, and mathematics (STEM)
   education involves lifelong education in various domains. Active
   learning strategies are receiving increased attention as an important
   tool, and particularly online-based formative assessment interfaces,
   although challenges to their use remain in sustainable and flipped STEM
   education. In this research, we observed pre-service teachers' (PSTs')
   performance and motivation in a university STEM course that was planned
   as a randomized examination of 71 students during a 2017/2018 course
   with an online interface for sustainable and flipped formative
   assessment. In terms of PSTs' standardized performance and the
   motivation effect survey, we gathered and examined the data to observe
   pre- and post-test results on adaptive assignments. Additionally,
   feedback from/to instructors and their log records were recorded by the
   proposed interface. The results demonstrate the PSTs' positive
   performance and motivation, and the feedback and log records reiterate
   its positive influence with 98.6\% participation in the sustainable and
   flipped online formative assessment interface. Consequently, the
   foremost drawbacks and challenges that current and traditional STEM
   education are facing are meaningfully reflected by the results obtained.
   Thus, the platform allows PSTs to be more involved in experimental
   contexts and validates learning performance, and the motivations effect
   survey provides a sustainable and active learning methodology for their
   future profession.},

Title = {Effectiveness of technology-enhanced learning in Endodontic education: a

Abstract = {The aim of the present systematic review was to evaluate the
   effectiveness of technology-enhanced learning (TEL) in the field of
   Endodontics to improve educational outcomes compared to traditional
   learning methods. Randomized controlled studies published in English
   were identified from two electronic databases (PubMed and Scopus) up to
   May 2018. Two authors independently performed study selection, data
   extraction and assessed the risk of bias (ROB). Any teaching method
   using TEL was considered as the intervention, and this was compared to
   traditional methods. The outcome measuring the effectiveness of learning
   activities was evaluated by Kirkpatrick's four-level training evaluation
   model. The four levels of training outcomes are as follows: Reaction,
   Learning, Behaviour and Results. A meta-analysis was performed to
   estimate the standardized mean difference (SMD) by the random effects
   model. In total, 13 studies were included in the systematic review. Only
   three studies were assessed as low' ROB. A meta-analysis could not be
   performed in the domains of Reaction and Behaviour. No significant
   difference was observed in knowledge gain (Learning domain) between TEL
   and traditional methods (SMD, 0.14 (95\% CI -0.10 to 0.39) I-2=62.7\%).
   Similarly, no difference was observed in performance (Behaviour domain).
   A variable response was found in attitude (Reaction domain). From the
   available evidence, it can be concluded that TEL is equally as effective
   as traditional learning methods.},

Abstract = {The aim of this paper is to determine whether the integration of digital
   pedagogies into the entire student learning lifecycle can improve exam
   performance. Since the inception of the so-called internet age, the use
   of technology has been explored as a platform for knowledge transfer. In
   formal education, this phenomenon has prompted higher education
   institutions to enhance their teaching and learning practices by
   integrating digital pedagogies into their courses. Accounting education,
   however, has been criticised for lagging behind mainstream educational
   developments in this area. This study bridges this gap by assessing
   whether the integration of digital pedagogies into the entire student
   learning lifecycle improves exam performance. An exploratory sequential
   mixed methods design was used in order to build the digital pedagogy,
   which was co-constructed with students. The pedagogy was then
   implemented and tested. The findings revealed that the treatment group
   outperformed the control group in exam performance (p < 0.01). This
   article contributes to the existing body of knowledge on accounting
   education by presenting an approach to working together with students to
   co-construct and integrate digital pedagogies into the entire student
   learning lifecycle. The study also proves that this holistic approach of
   technology integration can be effective in improving student exam
   performance.},

Abstract = {There are many choices for learning mathematics for engineering students
   with courses available in face-to-face, blended and fully online
   modalities. Students are demanding more flexibility in their programs,
   however the temptation to misuse this flexibility to avoid mathematical
   studies until it is too late can be an unfortunate side effect. A key
   issue here is that students may not have the skills needed to
   effectively self-regulate their learning. Using the 3P model of student
   learning as a guide we explore what happens to student learning outcomes
   when the best available online and face-to-face teaching and learning
   for mathematics students are used to create a blended learning
   environment for first year engineers that encourages self-regulation of
   learning. Experiments included online quizzes for changing attitudes,
   refreshing assumed knowledge and teaching foundational concepts,
   archived online lecture options in addition to face-to-face lectures,
   the adoption of board tutorials supported by a problem-solving approach
   for more complex engineering modelling problems and scaffolded with
   online interactive problems. Shared websites for online and face-to-face
   cohorts allowed the amount of blending to be determined by the
   individual student. Learning outcomes for blended first year engineering
   mathematics courses can be improved by implementing online learning
   tools that automate key learning conversations and implement effective
   face-to-face learning activities such as board tutorials that support
   students to self-regulate their learning of mathematics.},

Abstract = {The teaching of structures on architecture degrees has traditionally
   been based on didactic lectures covering theoretical content with
   exercises solved in class by the lecturer. This very passive teaching
   style which involves minimal student participation, was accompanied by a
   high failure rate. Based around calculating unrealistic models by hand,
   this method is unattractive from a pedagogical perspective, something
   reflected in low attendance rates. It also creates superficial learning
   in which concepts are quickly forgotten after finishing the module. This
   article presents the innovations adopted in the Structures II and
   Structures IV modules from the Architecture degree at the University of
   Malaga, which have made it possible to raise the pass rate and
   attendance, and also aim to give students a closer link to this content
   through the use of ICT. To do this, flipped learning and PBL
   methodologies were used along with various ICT tools that also made it
   possible to check how students follow the module with the aim of
   evaluating the results of continuous assessment.
   The results obtained show a rising trend in the pass rate with an
   improvement in the quality of the passes and an increase in the number
   of students who sit the exam in the first assessment period. It can be
   concluded that the use of the methodology described above leads to
   students being more involved and motivated by the subject, favouring
   continuous weekly work, and thus achieving better learning.},

Abstract = {The construct of active learning permeates undergraduate education in
   science, technology, engineering, and mathematics (STEM), but despite
   its prevalence, the construct means different things to different
   people, groups, and STEM domains. To better understand active learning,
   we constructed this review through an innovative interdisciplinary
   collaboration involving research teams from psychology and
   discipline-based education research (DBER). Our collaboration examined
   active learning from two different perspectives (i.e., psychology and
   DBER) and surveyed the current landscape of undergraduate STEM
   instructional practices related to the modes of active learning and
   traditional lecture. On that basis, we concluded that active
   learning-which is commonly used to communicate an alternative to lecture
   and does serve a purpose in higher education classroom practice-is an
   umbrella term that is not particularly useful in advancing research on
   learning. To clarify, we synthesized a working definition of active
   learning that operates within an elaborative framework, which we call
   the construction-of-understanding ecosystem. A cornerstone of this
   framework is that undergraduate learners should be active agents during
   instruction and that the social construction of meaning plays an
   important role for many learners, above and beyond their individual
   cognitive construction of knowledge. Our proposed framework offers a
   coherent and actionable concept of active learning with the aim of
   advancing future research and practice in undergraduate STEM education.},

Title = {Group behaviour process and learning: a review and assessment of
   emerging online technologies in executive education},
Journal = {EUROPEAN JOURNAL OF TRAINING AND DEVELOPMENT},
Abstract = {Purpose This paper aims to investigate the interaction of the
   relationships between group behaviour, group process and learning
   outcomes in online executive education. Design/methodology/approach A
   systematic review of literature in the relevant conceptual domains is
   performed. Findings A framework is proposed from the systematic review
   and proposes a dynamic classroom environment where instructor capability
   interacts with group process and behaviour to generate new learning
   outcomes. The impact of institutional context and technology
   infrastructure are highlighted as drivers of both the classroom and
   instructor effectiveness. Research limitations/implications The
   systematic review highlights several future research trajectories posing
   the questions: How disruptive innovation impacts on instructor
   capability development? How alternative theories explain the routines
   underpinning instructor capability? What is the role of external
   partners in the development of learning in context? What is the nature
   of instructor innovation capability? and How does instructor technology
   capability impact on learning outcomes? Practical implications Human
   resource development practitioners are presented with insights as to
   their existing and potential future roles in enhancing group behaviour,
   process and learning outcomes in executive classrooms impacted by
   technological change. The subsequent potential for practitioner enabled
   learning innovation is highlighted. Originality/value This paper
   contributes to contemporary debates regarding the interaction of
   emerging technologies and the executive online classroom, specifically
   focusing on the area of group behaviour process and learning.},

Title = {BLENDED LEARNING IN HIGHER MEDICAL EDUCATION: PRINCIPLES AND STRATEGIES
   OF TEACHING FOREIGN LANGUAGES},
Journal = {ADVANCED EDUCATION},
Year = {2020},
Number = {14, SI},
Pages = {11-18},
Abstract = {The article highlights the new approach to teaching a foreign language
   to medical students as a reasonable mixed method of traditional teaching
   and the use of modem technologies. Teaching process at higher medical
   educational institutions is based on innovative didactic technologies,
   mechanisms and procedures. Many theories suggest implementation of
   combined classroom and online teaching called blended or hybrid
   learning. The aim of this investigation is to develop practical
   recommendations for successful integration of blended learning with
   traditional teaching medical students at the Danylo Halytsky Lviv
   National Medical University. Web-based technology stimulates and
   promotes self-learning, keeps the learner at the centre of the learning
   process using personality-oriented and technology-mediated approaches.
   E-leaming promotes autonomy and motivates students to learn throughout
   the life performing specific tasks before or after classroom learning.
   The research involved 47 groups of students studying General Medicine at
   Danylo Halytsky Lviv National Medical University (602 second-year
   students, 2017-2018 academic year). The experiment consisted of 40\% of
   e-learning and 60\% of classroom teaching. Assessing performance, we
   concluded that students' academic performance results improved from 15\%
   to 23\% depending on the language skill due to the integration of
   blended learning strategies into the teaching process. Blended learning
   also assists students to choose and interpret required tasks, to assess
   cases related to future medical profession, and to apply compulsory
   information, which requires proficiency and practical skills.},

Title = {Impacts of Converting Courses to Virtual Instruction Midsemester at a
   Hispanic-Serving Institution},

Abstract = {The sudden transition from in-person to virtual learning during the
   spring 2020 semester posed challenges for students and faculty alike.
   This paper explores the techniques used by faculty to transform the
   chemistry and biochemistry curriculum at a Hispanic-serving institution
   with a significant proportion of first-generation students and the
   response of students to these changes. Faculty utilized an assortment of
   techniques, including synchronous lectures by video conference,
   asynchronous prerecorded lectures, online examinations with varying
   timing policies, and virtual office hours. A survey was completed by 332
   students across 26 different courses taught by 11 faculty regarding
   their preferences for course delivery format and the academic and
   nonacademic challenges they faced. A paired samples t-test indicated a
   statistically significant difference in satisfaction with face-to-face
   instruction (M = 4.13, SD = 0.765) and satisfaction with virtual
   instruction (M = 3.57, SD = 0.961), t(440) = 13.30, p < 0.001, Cohens d
   of 0.63, and Cronbachs alpha of 0.767. The results indicated a
   preference for face-to-face instruction. Open-ended survey questions
   identify that the primary academic challenges faced by students involved
   technology, understanding material, and difficulty obtaining help, while
   the primary nonacademic challenges were work issues, focus/motivation,
   and family issues. These results may inform future practices for virtual
   instruction.},

Title = {Digital chalk-talk videos improve knowledge and satisfaction in renal
   physiology},
Journal = {ADVANCES IN PHYSIOLOGY EDUCATION},

Abstract = {The authors began a curriculum reform project to improve the experience
   in a Renal Physiology course for first-year medical students. Taking
   into account both the variety of learning preferences among students and
   the benefits of student autonomy, the authors hypothesized that adding
   digital chalk-talk videos to lecture notes and live lectures would
   improve student knowledge, course satisfaction, and engagement. The
   authors measured performance on the renal physiology exam before (the
   traditional curriculum) and for 2 yr after implementation of the new
   curriculum. During the traditional and subsequent years, students took a
   Q-sort survey before and after the Renal Physiology course. Satisfaction
   was assessed based on ranked statements in the Q sort, as well as
   through qualitative analysis of student commentary. Compared with the
   traditional curriculum, mean scores on the renal physiology final exam
   were higher after implementation of the new curriculum: 65.3 vs. 74.4 (P
   < 0.001) with year 1 and 65.3 vs. 79.4 (P < 0.001) in the second year.
   After the new curriculum, students were more likely to agree with the
   statement, ``I wish other courses were taught like this one.{''}
   Qualitative analysis revealed how the video-based curriculum improved
   student engagement and satisfaction. Adding digital chalk-talk videos to
   a traditional Renal Physiology course that included active learning led
   to improved exam performance and high levels of student satisfaction.
   Other preclinical courses in medical school may benefit from such an
   intervention.},

Title = {Research-based instructional strategies in a flipped principles of
   microeconomics classroom},
Journal = {INTERNATIONAL REVIEW OF ECONOMICS EDUCATION},
Year = {2020},
Volume = {33},
Month = {MAR},
Abstract = {Principles of economics students often struggle to move beyond
   memorization of key terms and simple application of concepts to higher
   order thinking, such as evaluation and concept transfer. This higher
   order thinking is necessary for students to answer fundamental questions
   in economics. The primary advantage of the blend and flip format is that
   students can achieve low levels of learning, memorization of terms, and
   mastery of simple applications of concepts on their own before meeting
   for a face-to-face class. Previous research confirms that students in
   flipped-blended classes show larger gains in learning than students in
   moderately-blended classes. However, the gains we find are modest
   compared to those reported in related research in the math and science
   disciplines, which use research-based teaching practices, proven in the
   cognitive science literature. We determine the effects of using
   research-based instructional strategies on student learning in
   principles of microeconomics courses. Specifically, after controlling
   for a number of key background variables, we test whether students in
   flipped-blended classes who learn with research-based strategies in
   face-to-face classes are capable of applying knowledge and skills better
   than their counterparts in flipped-blended classes who are assigned
   practice problems similar to those on exams during face-to-face classes.
   Our findings indicate that students exposed to RBIS show significantly
   greater learning gains than students in the control group, and that
   these gains are most prevalent in the later part of the semester.},

Abstract = {This multiyear study helps elucidate how the instructional practice of
   student-generated questions support learning in a blended classroom in
   science, technology, engineering, and mathematics subjects. Students
   designed multiple-choice pre-exam questions aimed at higher levels of
   learning, according to Bloom's taxonomy. Student-generated questions
   were edited by the instructor and then discussed by the students in the
   classroom and in an online forum. We tested the hypothesis that this
   intervention improves student learning, measured as student achievement
   on the exam following the intervention, and compared to student
   achievement on the traditional exam (prior to which a review session
   focused on instructor-led recitation of the key concepts). Following the
   intervention in all years, average grade on the post-intervention exam
   increased by 7.44\%. It is important to point out that not all students
   benefited equally from this activity. Students who were in the 4th
   quintile (60\% to 80\%) based on the results of the 1st exam
   demonstrated the highest achievement improving their performance on
   average by 12.37\% percentage points (measured as a score on the 2nd
   exam). Gains were not observed in the semesters when the intervention
   was not implemented. In this study we provided students detailed
   instructions on how to design questions that focus on testing higher
   levels of learning.},

Title = {Critical research advancements of flipped learning: a review of the top
   100 highly cited papers},
Journal = {INTERACTIVE LEARNING ENVIRONMENTS},
Abstract = {Highly cited articles have been revealed as being informative for
   research fields, topics, and trends. Through reading highly cited
   articles, researchers can gain fruitful results from previous studies
   and can identify essential clues and potential future research
   directions for their own research. Aiming at exploring the possibility
   of the application of and innovations in flipped learning, this study
   reviewed 100 highly cited articles related to flipped learning. By
   performing a literature review of the highly cited studies on flipped
   learning, we have discovered the proposed new learning strategies and
   flipped learning applied to the research topics that seldom draw
   attention, and the research fields that are less-frequently examined,
   including those research issues that are rarely discussed. We have also
   noticed that many studies have focused on comparing different flipped
   learning modes and identifying more effective flipped learning
   approaches. Only a minority of studies have compared the influences of
   flipped learning and traditional learning. Moreover, we found that
   researchers have tended to focus more on students' learning achievements
   and learning behaviors. Lastly, based on the reviews of the past flipped
   learning articles, this study provides suggestions from different
   perspectives. We hope to provide a reference for researchers and
   teachers to conduct flipped learning studies and design flipped learning
   activities in the future.},

Title = {Student Engagement in a Flipped Secondary Mathematics Classroom},
Journal = {INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF SCIENCE AND MATHEMATICS EDUCATION},
Abstract = {Many students are becoming increasingly disengaged in school,
   particularly in mathematics. This is an important problem as lack of
   engagement may threaten students' achievement and performance in
   mathematics. A flipped learning pedagogy, which encourages students to
   take an active role in learning mathematics, has become a widely
   researched topic in recent years. However, few empirical studies to date
   have focused on the influence of flipped learning on student engagement
   in secondary mathematics classrooms. This qualitatively oriented study
   aimed to extend existing research on the role of flipped learning in
   behavioral, cognitive, and emotional engagement by adopting a social
   constructivist perspective to examine a secondary mathematics classroom.
   The participants were 33 high school students and their mathematics
   teacher, from whom data were gathered using multiple empirical methods.
   The results indicate that a flipped learning pedagogy has the potential
   to play a positive role in behavioral, cognitive, and emotional
   engagement as it provides learners with many possibilities for the
   learning of mathematics. However, to successfully flip learning, it is
   important to have a well-developed interactive design and to encourage
   social interaction in mathematics teaching and learning. Engagement was
   found to be negatively affected when the students had a negative
   perception of flipped learning and failed to complete the pre-class
   tasks. Overall, our results indicate that mathematics education can
   benefit from a flipped learning pedagogy as it has the potential to
   strengthen students' engagement and mathematics learning in a social
   environment.},

Title = {Strategies for enhancing self-regulation in e-learning: a review of
   selected journal publications from 2010 to 2020},
Journal = {INTERACTIVE LEARNING ENVIRONMENTS},
Abstract = {Researchers have pointed out the important role of self-regulation in
   learning. The self-regulated learning (SRL) process consists of three
   stages (i.e. forethought, performance, and self-reflection), each of
   which could involve different strategies for achieving the aim of SRL.
   To enable researchers and teachers to have a whole picture of how each
   strategy could be applied, this study analyzed the 2010-2020
   publications in seven SSCI journals of e-learning. In addition, the
   correlation between each SRL strategy and students' learning
   performances was analyzed. It was found that, in 58\% of the studies,
   the potential strategies for individual SRL stages were generally
   ignored. In addition, 40\% of the studies did not clearly state how SRL
   could be applied to practical applications. By referring to those SRL
   studies reporting the use of the strategies in each stage in specific
   application domains, it was found that goal setting and planning, which
   highly related to students' learning achievement, has been frequently
   discussed. Nevertheless, some strategies that highly correlated to
   students' cognitive performances and affect perceptions, such as
   environmental structuring, seeking information and rehearsing and
   memorizing, are often ignored. According to the findings, some
   suggestions are provided as a reference for researchers to conduct
   related research.},

Abstract = {Currently, the most used pedagogical approach in pharmaceutical studies
   is transmissive teaching, in which students usually adopt a passive
   attitude. The aim of this article is to present the main characteristics
   of active learning, and to point how it can be integrated in
   pharmaceutical studies by the way of team-based learning. According to
   its different characteristics, team-based learning is an authentic
   method of active learning. This pedagogical method includes a
   preparation time, usually individually performed, and followed by the
   group work itself, in which the case method is the most frequently used.
   Team-based learning also allows students to work in interdisciplinarity
   and facilitates interactions between peers. The wide majority of the
   studies demonstrate that students acclaim this pedagogical approach as
   compared to more conventional teaching methods, and that their
   satisfaction increases their commitment in the tasks proposed in the
   course. Even though the results of studies concerning the impact of
   team-based learning on student retention and scores in tests are
   somewhat discordant, this pedagogical approach allows the acquisition or
   the reinforcement of skills that will be useful to students in their
   future professional life, like collaborative work and confidence in
   their ability to complete a task. (C) 2020 Academie Nationale de

Abstract = {The COVID-19 outbreak has compelled many universities to immediately
   switch to the online delivery of lessons. Many instructors, however,
   have found developing effective online lessons in a very short period of
   time very stressful and difficult. This study describes how we
   successfully addressed this crisis by transforming two conventional
   flipped classes into fully online flipped classes with the help of a
   cloud-based video conferencing app. As in a conventional flipped course,
   in a fully online flipped course students are encouraged to complete
   online pre-class work. But unlike in the conventional flipped approach,
   students do not subsequently meet face-to-face in physical classrooms,
   but rather online. This study examines the effect of fully online
   flipped classrooms on student learning performance in two stages. In
   Stage One, we explain how we drew on the 5E framework to design two
   conventional flipped classes. The 5E framework consists of five
   phases-Engage, Explore, Explain, Elaborate, and Evaluate. In Stage Two,
   we describe how we transformed the two conventional flipped classes into
   fully online flipped classes. Quantitative analyses of students' final
   course marks reveal that the participants in the fully online flipped
   classes performed as effectively as participants in the conventional
   flipped learning classes. Our qualitative analyses of student and staff
   reflection data identify seven good practices for
   videoconferencing-assisted online flipped classrooms.},

Title = {A National Patient Safety Curriculum in Pediatric Emergency Medicine},
Journal = {PEDIATRIC EMERGENCY CARE},
Year = {2019},
Volume = {35},
Number = {8},
Pages = {519-521},
Month = {AUG},
Abstract = {Background Patient safety has become an important and required topic in
   medical education. A needs assessment showed that pediatric emergency
   medicine program directors were interested in a common pediatric
   emergency-specific safety curriculum. Objective The objective of this
   study was to describe the development and performance of a web-based
   patient safety curriculum in pediatric emergency medicine. Methods A
   web-based curriculum was created by the Committee on Quality
   Transformation of the Section of Emergency Medicine for the American
   Academy of Pediatrics. The curriculum consisted of emergency-specific
   safety topic didactic sessions with a pretest and posttest assessment.
   Vignette-based scenarios were also included and were discussed locally
   by the program directors. Results Fifty-two percent (37/71) of US
   Pediatric Emergency Medicine fellowship programs enrolled their fellows
   in the patient safety curriculum. Overall, 183 Pediatric Emergency
   Medicine fellows participated in the curriculum. Only 22\% (40/183) of
   fellow participants completed the entire curriculum. The curriculum
   showed significant improved safety knowledge based upon the pretest and
   posttest results. Sixty-five percent of responders thought more about
   safety topics after the curriculum was completed, and 85\% witnessed a
   safety event in the past month, whereas only 48\% reported them.
   Conclusions An online centralized curriculum is an effective platform
   for teaching content in quality and safety to a national group of
   physicians. Local oversight by program directors may improve compliance
   with curriculum completion.},

Title = {Creating Veterinary Public Health Online Cases by Students for Students},
Journal = {JOURNAL OF VETERINARY MEDICAL EDUCATION},
Abstract = {Online-based processing of case reports is often used and well accepted
   in veterinary medical education. However, lecturers usually develop
   cases from their own point of view, without input from students. In
   order to give students the chance to create online cases for students,
   an elective course, ``Creative Workshop Case Creation{''}, was held
   three times between 2017 and 2019 at the Faculty of Veterinary Medicine,
   Freie Universitat Berlin. During this course, students created cases
   based on animal welfare and epizootics issues through a problem-based
   blended learning approach. In this approach, students worked on an
   assigned veterinary public health problem and actively solved it in
   small groups in class and then used the issue as the basis to create
   cases for their fellow students. The cases were implemented in
   interdisciplinary lectures, which are mandatory for every student in
   semesters six to eight. After taking these classes, fellow students
   evaluated one of these cases, specifically, on animal welfare and
   another one on epizootics. Evaluations showed these cases were received
   well. Moreover, we received excellent feedback from students
   participating in the elective course and working with a proactive and
   motivated group of six students throughout the course was a very
   productive experience. The course made it possible to create cases that
   are more accurately tailored to the needs of students. The students'
   good ideas and preparatory work also saved time in the preparation of
   cases for lecturers.},

Title = {Improving Climate Change Awareness of Preservice Teachers (PSTs) through
   a University Science Learning Environment},
Journal = {EDUCATION SCIENCES},
Year = {2021},
Volume = {11},

Month = {FEB},
Abstract = {The position of universities is of great importance in climate change
   education (CCE) if the scientific, environmental, social, and political
   challenges the world confronts are to be met. It is, therefore, crucial
   to comprehend the CCE being engaged in globally by higher education
   institutions (HEIs). It is also important to discover and analyze the
   ways that HEIs can better address this challenge. Consistent with the
   requirements of research, this study offers an analysis of climate
   change awareness-raising of preservice teachers (PSTs) in a university
   science classroom with a flipped class intervention. A total of 109
   students participated in this research: 55 students in the control group
   (Group 1) and 54 students in the experimental group (Group 2). A
   questionnaire was used to detect any significant difference in the
   students' awareness of climate change for the two groups and before and
   after course completion. The analyzed results exposed the improved
   awareness of climate change in PSTs after a flipped class intervention,
   and, therefore, PSTs were more willing to engage in climate change
   teaching. Hence, the results of this study will contribute significantly
   to reducing existing drawbacks, which will be vital to comprehend the
   professional teaching developments of preservice teachers. Thus, this
   research can offer various instances of clarifying how climate change
   education may be placed in a higher science education context with
   certain adaptations.},

Abstract = {OBJECTIVE: To determine whether medical students valued interpretation
   of fetal ultrasound images with required preparation as an adjunct to
   observing alone at an ultrasound clinic.
   STUDY DESIGN: The prospective study involved third-year medical students
   during their introductory clerkship. Students reviewed a short article
   and presentation prior to a small-group session to interpret authentic
   fetal ultrasounds with a faculty member. Students observed image
   acquisition in an ultrasound clinic either before or after the session.
   Learner evaluation occurred immediately and using a mandatory, anonymous
   survey at the clerkship end (1=strongly disagree, 5 = strongly
   disagree).
   RESULTS: A total of 114 consecutive students attended both the
   small-group session and observational clinic. Neither students nor
   faculty members perceived time requirements for presession preparation
   as restrictive. Students rated the interpretation session to be valuable
   (score: 4.4 +/- 0.3, mean +/- standard deviation) and improved their
   self-perceived knowledge as compared to attendance at the clinic alone
   (score: 4.6 +/- 0.2). Nearly all preferred the interpretation session
   occur before the clinic (score: 4.5 +/- 0.3).
   CONCLUSION: Preparation for and attendance in a small-group session
   where students learned foundations of interpreting authentic fetal
   ultrasound images improved their self-perceived knowledge as compared to
   only observing at ultrasound clinics.},

Title = {Bringing technology to the mature classroom: age differences in use and
   attitudes},
Journal = {INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF EDUCATIONAL TECHNOLOGY IN HIGHER EDUCATION},
Year = {2020},
Volume = {17},
Number = {1},
Month = {MAR 23},
Abstract = {Mature students are anecdotally thought to be more anxious about
   technology than younger students, to the extent that they avoid using
   technology. This is a problem in today's higher education classrooms
   which often use a range of learning technologies, particularly as
   cohorts are becoming more and more likely to contain mature students.
   Previous work examining the attitudes of mature students to technology
   no longer reflects contemporary student age profiles or the current
   technological landscape. This study asks whether modern mature students
   in a UK university have more negative attitudes towards technology than
   younger students, and whether their usage of technology is different. A
   new diagnostic instrument, the Technology Attitudes Questionnaire, was
   developed to determine how students use technology for course activities
   and personal use, and their attitudes towards technology more generally.
   It was found that mature students use fewer technologies than younger
   students and use them less frequently, but have used them for a longer
   period over their lives. No difference was found for attitudes towards
   technology between the mature and younger groups. This research aims to
   contribute to the wider field of technology attitudes and use,
   particularly for the modern mature student cohort. These findings can be
   used to inform how educators design learning resources and use
   technology on their courses, working towards an age-inclusive programme.},

Title = {Active Learning via Problem-Based Collaborative Games in a Large
   Mathematics University Course in Hong Kong},

Abstract = {Research has demonstrated the positive impact of active learning on
   students' learning outcomes, particularly in science, technology,
   engineering and mathematics (STEM) fields. However, few studies have
   explored the impact of active learning via problem-based collaborative
   games in large mathematics classes in the context of Asian tertiary
   education. This study assesses the effects of active learning on
   students' learning outcomes using class test scores and the calculus
   concept inventory (CCI) to test the conceptual understanding of the
   basic principles of differential calculus, in a first year calculus
   course in Hong Kong. Three hypotheses were tested to determine the
   effects of game-based collaborative learning on learning mathematics
   among students. Active learning through a problem-based collaborative
   learning methodology was employed, using Kahoot!, a game-based learning
   platform. Results supported all three hypotheses, demonstrating a
   statistically significant increase in students' conceptual understanding
   and examination performance, based upon their individual perceptions of
   active engagement and time spent in active learning. Our results
   indicated that active learning ``levels the playing field{''}, in the
   sense that students with less pre-requisite background knowledge, using
   a problem-based collaborative learning methodology, were relatively more
   inclined to catch up or even exceed the performance of students with a
   stronger prerequisite background knowledge, at the end of the course.},

Abstract = {Despite the accumulated body of research on teaching English as an
   international language (EIL), few have offered a detailed overview of
   how to implement an EIL classroom, and still fewer empirical studies
   have been conducted. Twenty-one university students at a Japanese
   university participated in the study in the spring semester of 2015. The
   videoconference-embedded classroom (VEC) as an instructional
   intervention was implemented for 14 weeks: (1) pre-videoconference task
   (i.e. reading and presenting/discussing EIL issues) (11 weeks), (2)
   during-videoconference task (i.e. interacting online with EIL experts
   from three circle countries) (2 weeks), and (3) post-videoconference
   task (i.e. writing/ presenting the final term paper on EIL issues) (1
   week). Using a mixed research method consisting of a questionnaire,
   post-course class evaluations in spring 2014 (without VEC) and spring
   2015 (with VEC), and in-class observations, VEC was found to have
   important pedagogical benefits as it created an interactive learning
   environment and deepened the understanding of the EIL content.
   Additionally, 81\% of the participants had positive perceptions of EIL.
   Pedagogically, practitioners can implement EIL ideas using VEC pedagogy
   at the instructional level. Theoretically, it can also add new empirical
   findings to the field, which may help bridge a discrepancy between
   theory and practice.},

Abstract = {Recently, researchers have demonstrated the benefits of
   technology-enhanced science inquiry activities. To improve students'
   self-regulation and assist them in controlling their own learning pace
   through inquiry activities, in this study, a self-regulated science
   inquiry approach was developed to assist them in organizing information
   from their real-world exploration. A quasi-experimental design was
   conducted in an elementary school natural science course to evaluate the
   students' performance using the proposed learning approach. One class
   assigned as the treatment group learned with the self-regulated science
   inquiry approach, while the other class assigned as the control group
   learned with the conventional science inquiry approach. The students'
   learning achievement, tendency of information help seeking, tendency of
   self-regulation, and self-efficacy were evaluated. The results of the
   study revealed that the self-regulated science inquiry approach improved
   the students' learning achievement, especially for those students with
   higher self-regulation. In addition, the students who conducted inquiry
   with the self-regulated learning strategy increased their tendency of
   information help seeking, self-efficacy, and several aspects of
   self-regulation, including time management, help seeking, and
   self-evaluation. Accordingly, this study demonstrated the effectiveness
   of the self-regulated learning strategy, an approach with high learner
   control, in terms of improving students' learning achievement and their
   self-regulation.},

Abstract = {Scholars have suggested that flipped learning can be enhanced by
   designing effective in-class learning activities to improve students'
   higher order thinking skills. Problem posing has been recognized as such
   a learning strategy that has great potential for improving students'
   higher order thinking skills. However, it has been reported as a
   challenging task for most students. Research evidence has indicated the
   potential of engaging students in group learning with step-by-step hints
   when conducting problem-posing activities. Therefore, this study
   proposed a multilevel concept mapping-based problem-posing strategy to
   assist students in completing the problem-posing tasks in flipped
   learning. To understand the effectiveness of the proposed strategy, a
   flipped learning system was developed and adopted in the science class
   of an elementary school. Seventy-five fifth graders from three classes
   were divided into experimental group A, experimental Group B and a
   control group. Students in Group A used the concept map-guided
   problem-posing strategy for flipped learning (CMPP-FL), students in
   Group B used the problem-posing strategy-based flipped learning, while
   students in the control group used the conventional flipped learning
   strategy. The results showed that the CMPP-FL was effective in terms of
   improving students' learning performance, especially for students with
   higher levels of critical thinking tendency.},

Title = {With Anchors Aweigh, Synchronous Instruction Preferred by Naval Academy
   Instructors in Small Undergraduate Chemistry Classes},

Abstract = {The U.S. Naval Academy matriculates similar to 1,100 new undergraduate
   students each year, all of whom are required to complete two semesters
   of introductory chemistry, regardless of major selection. Thus, each of
   the similar to 50 sections of introductory chemistry comprises students
   with a broad range of interests, prior chemistry experience, and
   analytical skills. A survey of 28 chemistry instructors that taught
   introductory and upper-level courses remotely in the wake of the
   COVID-19 pandemic showed that most met with their students during every
   scheduled class period and delivered new content synchronously, though
   methods of instruction varied widely within those parameters. Student
   engagement decreased in the remote environment, but a small number of
   instructors reported improvements when a web-based classroom response
   system was implemented. Extra instruction was requested by fewer
   students, was generally conducted in group sessions, and was more
   time-consuming for the faculty. Most faculty teaching introductory
   chemistry used more multiple-choice assessments than they would in a
   live setting, because of compatibility with online testing platforms,
   and most faculty reported little evidence of academic dishonesty during
   online teaching, in spite of negative preconceptions. The dominant
   faculty perception is that student performance did not decline after the
   switch to online learning. Collaborative, supportive, and frequent
   communication among faculty and staff in the chemistry department was
   instrumental in facilitating the transition to online teaching.},

Title = {Expanding Medical Education for Local Health Promoters Among Remote
   Communities of the Peruvian Amazon: An Exploratory Study of an
   Innovative Program Model},
Journal = {ADVANCES IN MEDICAL EDUCATION AND PRACTICE},
Year = {2020},
Volume = {11},
Pages = {215-223},
Abstract = {Purpose: Community health workers (CHWs) play integral roles in primary
   health care provision in low- and middle-income countries (LMICs). This
   is particularly true in underdeveloped areas where there are acute
   shortages of health workers. In this study, we evaluated the development
   and community utilization of a CHW training program in the Loreto
   province of Peru. Additionally, a community-oriented training model was
   designed to augment access to basic health information in underserved
   and isolated areas of the Amazon.
   Methods: Health resource utilization was compared in each community by
   surveying community members before and after implementation of the CHW
   training program, which utilized a community participatory program
   development (CPPD) model.
   Results: All communities demonstrated significantly increased CHW
   utilization (p = 0.026) as their initial point of contact for immediate
   health concerns following CHW training implementation. This increase in
   CHW utilization was accompanied by trends toward decreased preferences
   for local shamans or traveling to the closest health post as the initial
   health resource.
   Conclusion: The community-focused, technology-oriented model utilized in
   this study proved an effective way to promote the use of CHWs in the
   Amazon region of Loreto, and could prove valuable to CHW capacitation
   efforts within other Peruvian provinces and in other LMICs around the
   world.},

Abstract = {Background In German veterinary education interdisciplinary lectures
   (ILs) are an important and mandatory part of the curriculum as their
   merging character builds a useful preparation for the future profession
   as a veterinarian. These lectures should enable students to work on
   practically-relevant and interdisciplinary cases, which should ideally
   be defined jointly by lecturers from different disciplines. Methods In
   order to give students the opportunity to work on these cases and at the
   same time have contact with their lecturers and fellow students, the
   Faculty of Veterinary Medicine, Freie Universitat Berlin, has converted
   its former in-class ILs (face-to-face delivery format) into a blended
   learning format. The mandatory lectures comprise 196 curricular hours
   and are delivered over the course of three semesters within the
   veterinary curriculum. The new concept was developed over a period of
   three academic years and extensively evaluated (old-new-comparison) with
   regard to its acceptance and compliance with national requirements for
   interdisciplinary teaching. Results A total of 306 students were asked
   to evaluate different aspects of the newly implemented format. Overall,
   more than 79\% of the students attending the newly implemented blended
   learning format responded positively, and the evaluation showed a
   significant improvement of learning motivation and acceptance when
   compared to the traditional teaching format. Conclusion The results
   indicated that blended learning is a suitable option for teaching
   mandatory ILs in clinical medicine and veterinary public health.},

Journal = {INFORMATION AND LEARNING SCIENCES},
Year = {2019},
Volume = {120},
Number = {7-8},
Pages = {519-540},
Abstract = {Purpose - Students in flipped classrooms are challenged to orchestrate
   an increasingly heterogeneous collection of learning objects, including
   audiovisual materials as well as traditional learning objects, such as
   textbooks and syllabi. This study aims to examine students' information
   practices interacting with and synthesizing across learning objects,
   technologies and people in flipped classrooms.
   Design/methodology/approach - This grounded theory study explores the
   information practices of 12 undergraduate engineering students as they
   learned in two flipped classrooms. An artifact walkthrough was used to
   elicit descriptions of how students conceptualize and work around
   interoperability problems between the diverse and distributed learning
   objects by weaving them together into information tapestries.
   Findings - Students maintained a notebook as an information tapestry,
   weaving fragmented information snippets from the available learning
   objects, including, but not limited to, instructional videos and
   textbooks. Students also connected with peers on Facebook, a
   back-channel that allowed them to sidestep the academic honesty policy
   of the course discussion forum, when collaborating on homework
   assignments.
   Originality/value - The importance of the interoperability of tools with
   elements of students' information space and the significance of
   designing for existing information practices are two outcomes of the
   grounded theory approach. Design implications for educational technology
   including the weaving of mixed media and the establishment of spaces for
   student-to-student interaction are also discussed.},

Pages = {157-178},
Abstract = {Purpose: This study aimed to predict the achievement of pre-service
   teachers majoring in education through some learner characteristics like
   gender, self-directed learning readiness dimensions, and course context
   (being in the flipped learning class and traditional teaching classes).
   Research Methods: This study employed a relational survey research
   design and involved 271 pre-service teachers who were selected according
   to the purposive sampling method. Data were collected by implementing an
   achievement test and Self-directed Learning Readiness Scale and analyzed
   through the Hierarchical Multiple Linear Regression procedure..
   Findings The findings of the study showed that in the first model,
   gender and desire for learning predicted the achievement of pre-service
   teachers. The second model revealed that being in a flipped learning
   class predicted the academic achievement of pre-service teachers than
   being in any other classes taught according to traditional teaching
   principles
   Implications for Research and Practice: It is suggested that pre-service
   teachers are provided with opportunities to apply what they have learned
   theoretically. Also, it may be suggested that instructors include
   various computer applications, software, games, and videos from YouTube
   to increase the pre-service teachers' desire to learn. Lastly, for
   further studies, it may be suggested to include different variables in
   predicting the achievement of pre-service teachers. (C) 2020 Ani

Abstract = {Investigating the effectiveness of instructional practices provides an
   evidence base to inform instructional decisions. Synthesizing research
   studies on instructional effectiveness provides an estimate of the
   generalizability of effectiveness across settings, along with an
   exploration of factors that may moderate the impact, which cannot be
   achieved within individual studies. This study sought to provide a
   synthesis of evidence-based instructional practices (EBIPs) particular
   to chemistry through meta-analysis. Ninety-nine studies were analyzed
   comprising a broader view of chemistry specific studies than past
   meta-analyses. The results showed that EBIPs feature a demonstrably
   positive impact on students' academic performance in chemistry, although
   assessment topic coverage and setting size emerged as relevant
   moderators of impact and prevented making definitive conclusions of the
   relative impact of each EBIP. In examining publication bias, an
   asymmetric distribution of studies based on standard error (SE) and
   effect size was found, indicative of potential publication bias. To
   explore the potential impact of bias, the trim and fill method was
   employed resulting in a range for the overall weighted effect size from
   0.29 to 0.62. The study concludes that evidence-based instructional
   practices have demonstrated effectiveness even in consideration of
   potential publication bias, as the range of effect sizes remains
   positive, but highlights the continued need to publish null findings in
   the research literature.},

Abstract = {Over three years, our research team has designed various learning
   supports for promoting content knowledge and solving game levels. In
   this case study, we examined the optimal design and the evaluation of
   learning support videos for a physics educational game. Often studies
   focus on investigating the effects of research-based principles without
   a systematic examination of the design and development processes. Thus,
   comprehensive design descriptions and recommendations for developing
   effective in-game learning supports are scarce in the literature. This
   study comprises two stages: design and evaluation. In the design stage,
   we collaborated with two physics experts to design and iteratively
   revise 18 learning support videos. We applied the First Principles of
   Instruction (Merrill, 2002) to create instructional strategies and
   multimedia learning principles (Mayer, 2017) to develop the videos and
   help learners engage in cognitive processing. In the evaluation stage,
   we presented the videos to 14 students to gather feedback on their
   perceptions and, in the following year, examined the effectiveness of
   the final videos with 263 students. Results revealed that, among all
   supports, the videos were the only support that significantly predicted
   posttest scores and game levels completed and viewing patterns did not
   affect game enjoyment. We conclude with a discussion of our experiences
   and recommendations to contribute to the foundation of designing in-game
   learning supports.},

Abstract = {With the increased reliance on technology, computer programming has
   emerged as an essential skill that is interesting to many audiences
   beyond merely computer scientists. As a result, many students from
   various disciplines take first-year computer science courses. This led
   to classrooms with a lot of diversity in student motivation,
   backgrounds, learning needs, and educational levels. Teaching the same
   material to such a diverse group is challenging. The aim of this paper
   is two-fold. Firstly, we present a flipped-based approach that benefits
   from the mixed-ability nature of first-year programming courses rather
   than considering it as a burden. Secondly, we present a study that
   evaluates the extent to which the proposed approach enhances student
   learning in such a mixed-ability environment. The study was conducted in
   a first-year course at the University of British Columbia - Okanagan,
   and it was based on three components:1) a survey of 25 Likert items(n =
   46), 2) class average grade and pass rate over 6 years (n = 42 + 38 + 56
   + 79 + 90 + 74), and 3) student ratings of the course over 5 years (n =
   42 + 38 + 56 + 79 + 90). Findings of the survey indicate an overall
   positive students' impression with no significant difference in the
   opinions of various student populations. Analyzing the course grades,
   pass rates, and student ratings confirmed the survey findings and showed
   an overall improvement in grades, pass-rates, and student satisfaction.},

Abstract = {The new framework for the quality of higher education proposes to
   transform the paradigm of didactic intervention, orienting it towards
   more active mixed methodologies, centered on the student's learning
   process, incorporating technological tools that allow a better
   development of the teaching-learning processes. The objective of this
   study is to apply the Inverted Classroom model through a Moodle virtual
   platform for the development of research competencies. The study is
   applied to 46 participants graduated from the professional career of
   Communication Sciences at the national University of Piura (Peru), where
   they participated in a professional updating and degree program. The
   methodology applied is mixed, with quantitative and qualitative data,
   following a pre-experimental design. To evaluate the competencies,
   quantitative data were collected at the beginning and end of the Applied
   Research course.
   The research hypothesis is to validate whether in the context of the
   subject of Applied Research in Communication Sciences the pedagogical
   model Inverted Classroom through the use of the virtual platform Moodle
   has an effect on the development of research skills in students. The
   data collection process is carried out at the beginning with a knowledge
   test applied to the students and at the end with the qualification
   obtained through an evaluation matrix. The results obtained show
   significant differences in the average grades of the students, obtained
   before and after using the Inverted Classroom model, where better
   results are obtained in the competences referred to the elaboration of
   the theoretical framework and approach of the study.},

Title = {Efficacy of Multimedia Learning Modules as Preparation for Lecture-Based
   Tutorials in Electromagnetism},

Abstract = {We have investigated the efficacy of on-line, multimedia learning
   modules (MLMs) as preparation for in-class, lecture-based tutorials in
   electromagnetism in a physics course for natural science majors (biology
   and marine science). Specifically, we report the results of a
   multiple-group pre/post-test research design comparing two groups
   receiving different treatments with respect to activities preceding
   participation in Tutorials in Introductory Physics. The different
   pre-tutorial activities were as follows: (1) students were assigned
   reading from a traditional textbook, followed by a traditional lecture;
   and (2) students completed on-line MLMs developed by the Physics
   Education Research Group at the University of Illinois at Urbana
   Champaign (UIUC), and commercially known as FlipItPhysics. The MLM
   treatment group earned significantly higher mid-term examination scores
   and larger gains in content knowledge as measured by the Conceptual
   Survey of Electricity and Magnetism (CSEM). Student attitudes towards
   ``reformed{''} instruction in the form of active-engagement tutorials
   were also improved. Specifically, post-course surveys showed that
   MLM-group students believed class time was more effective and the
   instructor was more clear than reported by non-MLM students, even though
   there was no significant difference between groups with respect to
   in-class activities and the same instructor taught both groups. MLM
   activities can be a highly effective tool for some student populations,
   especially when student preparation and buy-in are important for
   realizing significant gains.},

Title = {From Theory to Practice of Promoting Student Engagement in Business and
   Law-Related Disciplines: The Case of Undergraduate Economics Education},
Journal = {EDUCATION SCIENCES},
Year = {2020},

Abstract = {Higher education is experiencing a paradigm shift from passive learning
   towards active learning. The COVID-19 pandemic has further presented an
   opportunity for education providers to enhance teaching that includes
   non-campus modes. However, concerns regarding student engagement lie at
   the heart of the transition to active learning environments in the
   context of the increased demand for online education. Therefore,
   promoting student engagement has become an educational priority since
   greater student engagement translates into valued student experiences,
   higher academic performance, and increased retention rates. This paper
   semi-systematically reviews the literature on student engagement in
   undergraduate economics education. Close emphasis is also paid to the
   relationships between the direct measures of disengagement such as
   absenteeism on student performance in economics. The student engagement
   framework developed by Frederiks, Blumenfeld, and Paris (2004) is used
   to classify the dimensions of student engagement and the factors that
   influence the different dimensions of engagement. The literature
   reviewed is predominately occupied with behavioral aspects of engagement
   with little attention towards capturing the cognitive and emotional
   aspects of student engagement. Three key recommendations are noted from
   the study in order for business school educators and higher education
   policy makers to promote student engagement in economics education.
   Future research on student engagement in undergraduate business
   education should focus more on capturing the cognitive and emotional
   aspects of student engagement to inform policymaking in promoting
   student engagement.},

Title = {Feasibility and perceptions of video tutorials for intern training in
   anaesthesia: a survey},
Journal = {SOUTHERN AFRICAN JOURNAL OF ANAESTHESIA AND ANALGESIA},
Year = {2019},
Volume = {25},
Number = {3},
Pages = {16-23},
Abstract = {Background: Effective intern training is essential for safe delivery of
   anaesthesia during community service. Interns are trained using both
   tutorials and clinical exposure. E-learning platforms using video
   tutorials may address millennial learner needs better, but feasibility
   is unknown in a particular local setting. This study aimed to explore
   the feasibility of using a video tutorial to facilitate intern training.
   Perceptions of the value of tutorials were also assessed.
   Methods: A cross-sectional survey was conducted amongst interns who
   rotated through anaesthesia at a regional hospital in KwaZulu-Natal. The
   interns had been exposed to face-to-face tutorials previously and
   provided with a video-based tutorial.
   Results: Thirty-seven of the interns consented (88\%), watched the video
   and answered the questionnaire. All interns indicated a need for
   tutorials during internship. A majority of respondents (71\%) felt
   underprepared by undergraduate training programmes. Most interns were
   prepared to watch the video tutorial outside of working hours; however,
   they were divided over the fairness of using internet access for
   tutorials. There was a preference for video tutorials over reading a
   textbook or lecture notes. A total of 88\% watched the video from the
   Internet. One intern did not have Internet access or a computer but the
   video was watched using a free Wi-Fi hotspot.
   Conclusion: A video-based tutorial system is feasible but current
   infrastructure needs to be considered. Interns continue to feel
   underprepared for internship and request that tutorials continue in
   internship.},

Abstract = {The number of transgender and gender-diverse patients seeking medical
   care in the United States is increasing. For many of these patients,
   pharmacotherapy is a part of their gender-affirming transition.
   Effective instructional methods and resources for teaching pharmacy
   students about this patient population's social considerations and
   medical treatments is lacking. Three hours of educational material on
   caring for transgender patients was added to a third-year course in a
   four-year Doctorate of Pharmacy program in the United States. The
   content included cultural, empathy, and medical considerations. Students
   in the course were given a survey to assess their perception of each
   instructional method's effectiveness and self-assess their confidence in
   providing competent gender-affirming care to transgender people before
   and after the learning session. The survey response rate was 36\%
   (54/152). Students' self-assessed confidence to provide competent care
   to people who are transgender increased significantly Before the
   learning session, the median confidence level was 4/10 (Interquartile
   range (IQR) 3-6), after the class session, the median confidence
   increased to 7/10 (IQR 6-8, p < 0.01). Students rated the pre-class
   video, jeopardy game, and patient panel as most helpful to improving
   their skills. The addition of transgender-related patient care material
   into the Doctorate of Pharmacy curriculum significantly increased the
   students' confidence to provide competent care to people who are
   transgender.},

Journal = {EUROPEAN PHYSICAL EDUCATION REVIEW},
Year = {2020},
Volume = {26},
Number = {1},
Pages = {70-84},

Abstract = {Flipped learning (FL) is a pedagogical approach that has scarcely been
   examined in physical education (PE). As a result, we have little
   information regarding what PE teachers think of the approach, how they
   apply it, or what perceived value it has for their teaching. This
   research explores the reasons which two UK-based PE teachers gave for
   why and how they used FL to complement their use of digital technology
   (DigiTech). Their experiences and views are explored through a case
   study/appreciative inquiry approach. Data were generated from: (a)
   interviews with the teachers; (b) lesson observations and field notes
   and (c) document analysis, all of which were analysed using grounded
   theory. The findings showed that each teacher used FL and DigiTech in
   nuanced ways to support their teaching. Despite personal differences, FL
   was established by both teachers as a consistent routine of practice to
   support the use of DigiTech. The teachers' rationales for using FL
   hinged on their belief that: (a) it optimised the lesson time in which
   students could be physically active and (b) it supported their
   examination PE students. Overall, the results indicated that, when used
   in conjunction with DigiTech, FL has the potential to pedagogically
   support teachers' teaching of PE. This is particularly pertinent given
   the limited time allocated in the curriculum to PE (some of which is
   inevitably lost in the changing rooms) and the perceived need for
   students to be physically active in lessons.},

Abstract = {Selecting and ordering components for sustainable science education is a
   critical issue, which is presently obtaining increased attention because
   of being at an early stage and scarce application in higher education.
   Though the flipped e-learning scheme is one of the novel information and
   communication technologies (ICTs), it can be of great relevance in a
   long-term learning program for various sustainable science education
   criteria. This research presents an approach to identify and analyze
   elements for science education for sustainable development with
   multi-criteria decision analysis-fuzzy decision-making trial and
   evaluation laboratory (MCDA-FDEMATEL) method by flipped e-learning
   system. With the method proposed, the main elements are collected as
   science-education, sustainable-development, technology-infrastructure
   and flipped-e-learning elements. The final results' analyses with
   sixteen sub-elements are assessed with weighted linear combination (WLC)
   and sensitivity-analysis (I to VI implementations) in the context of the
   MCDA-FDEMATEL method. The most important element and sub-element for
   science education for sustainable development through flipped e-learning
   teaching are sustainable-development (as an element), VI implementation
   with 0.540 weight, and environmental contents (as a sub-element) with
   0.570 weight. Consequently, this proposed approach could be used in
   different studies to validate the most important aspects of science
   education for sustainable development through flipped e-learning
   teaching elements and sub-elements with equivalent and comparable
   education settings.},

Abstract = {Purpose - The purpose of this paper is to: (1) explore existing
   practices of STEM faculty at a private Lebanese university and (2)
   assess the extent of implementation of active learning among faculty
   members of selected STEM departments.
   Design/methodology/approach - The Working Group on ``Integrating Modern
   Scientific teaching methodologies in STEM{''} (IM-STEM) at a tertiary
   university in Lebanon advocates for novel research-based methods to
   enhance STEM education. This pilot study investigated, using a modified
   version of the Wieman and Gilbert ``Teaching Practices Inventory{''},
   the current teaching methods used by faculty members in selected STEM
   departments.
   Findings - Remarkably, most respondents admit a willingness to
   incorporate new teaching methods. Main findings indicate that
   traditional teaching via didactic lecturing remains prevalent in the
   STEM classrooms at the tertiary academic institution in Lebanon despite
   sporadic individual efforts by faculty members to utilize unconventional
   methods and active learning.
   Research limitations/implications - One major limitation that influenced
   the efficiency of this study is the small number of respondents (71
   faculty members). More in-depth data collection combining quantitative
   and qualitative data should be done in future studies.
   Practical implications - Gaining insight into the actual methods used in
   STEM fields in various departments can help the university management to
   better understand the key importance of educational reform.
   Originality/value - The main value of this paper is to serve as a
   prelude for educational reform at a tertiary academic institution.},

Abstract = {Background and purpose: The objectives of this study were to implement
   multiple active learning strategies in pharmacology and evaluate the
   most effective method to promote understanding.
   Educational activity and setting: A structured, student-centered
   learning approach was launched. The implemented active learning
   strategies were Kahoot web-based interactive games, crossword puzzles,
   an instructional video, a music video, and fill-in-the-blank tables. For
   three consecutive years, several topics in pharmacology were taught by
   the same instructor. While traditional teaching was used for the class
   of 2016, the above-mentioned active learning strategies were utilized
   for the classes of 2017 and 2018. Student perceptions on traditional
   teaching vs. active learning and on the different active learning
   methods were determined by anonymous survey. The effectiveness of active
   learning on understanding pharmacology concepts was detected by
   extracting student performance data from ExamSoft item analysis.
   Findings: Based on exam performance assessment, students in the classes
   of 2017 and 2018 performed significantly better when fill-in-the-blank
   activities and videos were utilized. However, students believed that
   web-based games helped them better understand concepts. Variables
   between the classes of 2016, 2017, and 2018 were minimized through
   comparison of the same lecture topics and having the same instructor
   write exam questions.
   Summary: Although students perceived Kahoot web-based interactive gaming
   as the most valuable active learning strategy, fill-in-the-blank
   activities and videos were more effective in understanding the
   pharmacology concepts as measured by their exam performance.},

Title = {Teaching Outbreak Investigations with an Interactive Blended Learning
   Approach},
Journal = {JOURNAL OF VETERINARY MEDICAL EDUCATION},
Abstract = {Public health is a central but often neglected component of veterinary
   education. German veterinary public health (VPH) education includes
   substantial theory-focused lectures, but practical case studies are
   often missing. To change this, we combined the advantages of case-based
   teaching and blended learning to teach these topics in a more practical
   and interactive way. Blended learning describes the combination of
   online and classroom-based teaching. With it, we created an
   interdisciplinary module for outbreak investigations and zoonoses, based
   on the epidemiology, food safety, and microbiology disciplines. We
   implemented this module within the veterinary curriculum of the seventh
   semester (in the clinical phase of the studies). In this study, we
   investigated the acceptance of this interdisciplinary approach and
   established a framework for the creation of interactive outbreak
   investigation cases that can serve as a basis for further cases. Over a
   period of 3 years, we created three interactive online cases and one
   interactive in-class case and observed the student-reported evaluation
   of the blended learning concept and self-assessed learning outcomes.
   Results show that 80\% (75-89) of students evaluated the chosen
   combination of case-based and blended learning for interdisciplinary
   teaching positively and therefore accepted it well. Additionally, 76\%
   (70-98) of students evaluated their self-assessed learning outcomes
   positively. Our results suggest that teaching VPH through
   interdisciplinary cases in a blended learning approach can increase the
   quality of teaching VPH topics. Moreover, it provides a framework to
   incorporate realistic interdisciplinary VPH cases into the curriculum.},

Title = {Mobile English language learning: a systematic review of group size,
   duration, and assessment methods},
Journal = {COMPUTER ASSISTED LANGUAGE LEARNING},
Abstract = {Technology-mediated learning has become a valuable tool, especially in
   the English language classroom. Nowadays, mobile learning is considered
   a significant educational tool for promoting education among learners.
   Several recent studies have attempted to examine different aspects of
   mobile learning. The size of the experimental group, and the duration
   and suitability of the assessment methods are important aspects in
   designing experimental studies in the context of mobile English language
   learning. Yet, very few studies have paid attention to these aspects.
   Therefore, this study aimed to investigate the utilisation of
   state-of-the-art mobile technology in English language learning,
   especially in terms of the size of the experimental groups, and the
   duration and suitability of the assessment methods. Following a
   systematic review protocol, 151 articles published between 2010 and 2017
   were selected for analysis. Furthermore, this study considered,
   separately, three factors addressed in the reviewed studies: language
   acquisition problems, types of participants, and targeted English
   skills. The findings showed that the group size and study duration
   significantly differed among the studies based on the above factors.
   Questionnaires and tests were found to be the most common methods of
   assessment for each factor, whether used separately or in combination.
   The results of this review can assist in the formulation of experimental
   designs to mitigate the challenges and facilitate the effective use of
   mobile learning in English language learning.},

Abstract = {The current choice of digital teaching and learning formats in medicine
   is very heterogeneous. In addition to the widely used classical static
   formats, social communication tools, audio/video-based media,
   interactive formats, and electronic testing systems enrich the learning
   environment.
   For medical students, the private use of digital media is not
   necessarily linked to their meaningful use in the study. Many gain their
   experience of digital learning in the sense of ``assessment drives
   learning{''}, especially by taking online exams in a passive, consuming
   role. About half of all medical students can be referred to as
   ``e-examinees{''} whose handling of digital learning is primarily
   focused on online exam preparation. Essentially, they do not actively
   influence their digital environment. Only a quarter can be identified as
   a ``digital all-rounder{''}, who compiles their individual learning
   portfolio from the broad range of digital media.
   At present, the use of digital media is not yet an integral and
   comprehensive component of the teaching framework of medical studies in
   Germany, but is rather used in the sense of a punctual teaching
   enrichment. Current trends in digital teaching and learning offerings
   are mobile, interactive, and personalized platforms as well as
   increasing the relevance of learning platforms. Furthermore, didactical
   concepts targeting the changed learning habits of the students are more
   successful regarding the acceptance and learning outcomes. In addition,
   digitalization is currently gaining importance as a component in the
   medical school curricula.},

Title = {Improving Student Assessment of a Server Administration Course Promoting

Abstract = {Contribution: This paper describes a highly flexible design for a
   master's-level server administration course that uses updated
   technologies, addresses the most important course design challenges and
   extracts useful feedback from student work. The main contribution of
   this design is eliminating the self-regulation challenge students
   encounter in similar highly flexible computer-related courses. This is
   attributed to the introduction of orientation lectures and a competitive
   element; these may have helped students to achieve their goals on time.
   Background: The Web server administration course on the master's of the
   Web engineering program was intended to inculcate a series of
   competences, such as common administration techniques, procedures to
   increase security, efficient website deployment, and an introduction to
   clusters and infrastructure deployment automation. The course generally
   failed to transmit these competencies effectively; complaints were made
   about the difficulty of the course and the low applicability of its
   contents.
   Intended Outcomes: The design facilitates students finding assessment
   activities that better suit their profiles or previous experience, and
   enables them to customize their assessment, thus encouraging them and
   giving future value to their work.
   Application Design: The course design maximizes assessment flexibility
   by providing students with many optional activities from which to
   choose. It also promotes a healthy competitive spirit to improve
   student's motivation and results.
   Findings: Complaints about the difficulty or lack of applicability were
   no longer made. The course is highly valued by the students, achieving a
   very high pass rate and average score.},

Title = {Comparison of student performance and perceptions of a traditional
   lecture course versus an inverted classroom format for clinical
   microbiology},

Abstract = {Objective: Student satisfaction and student performance are of primary
   concern when classroom pedagogy is changed. We determine the equivalence
   of two teaching methodologies in a clinical microbiology course using
   test scores as the measure of student performance.
   Methods: The two teaching methodologies examined were a traditional
   lecture-based method face-to-face (F2F) method and an inverted classroom
   method (ICM). Student perceptions of the 1CM method were measured using
   a course survey in which students were asked to compare their
   experiences in the ICM class with experiences in a traditional F2F
   class. Classroom exams were administered in the same way in the
   traditional F2F lecture and ICM courses. Student test averages obtained
   in both pedagogies were compared for equivalence using an independent
   samples t-test. A six-question survey was developed to assess student
   perception of the ICM classroom compared to that for the traditional
   lecture-based classroom.
   Results: Test performance of students in the ICM was equivalent to that
   of students receiving traditional F2F lectures. Mean difference between
   test scores for the ICM and traditional F2F groups was 1.9 points (95\%
   confidence interval {[}CI], -4.0-0.14). Survey responses indicated that
   respondents feel positively about self-learning in ICM and prefer the
   flexibility provided by ICM.
   Conclusion: This study provides evidence that the ICM method of teaching
   clinical microbiology can replace the traditional F2F method without
   loss of student performance. Respondent perceptions of the inverted
   classroom were positive, with students favoring the flexibility.},

   learning platform Moodle together with a videoconferencing tool.
   Background: Due to the COVID-19 pandemic, all global education has been
   shifted from face-to-face to distance learning. While the debate on the
   effectiveness of active learning alternatives to the traditional
   lectures was still going on, the teachers found themselves facing a
   further difficulty: how to engage the students in a totally online
   learning process, where personal contact is completely lacking. The
   authors found the answer in the online application of peer instruction.
   Intended Outcomes: The use of online peer instruction (OPI) is expected
   to engage all the students attending the online lectures in an active
   learning process, improving their understanding of the topics covered at
   the same time. Application Design: The use of Moodle has made it
   possible to bring the peer instruction method online. The appropriate
   setup of Moodle's Choice and Workshop activities was sufficient to
   manage the whole process from a technical standpoint, with the teacher
   managing the communication aspect, via the videoconferencing tool used
   to give the lectures. Findings: The application of OPI engaged all the
   students in the online lectures and proved to be effective in improving
   students' understanding of the topics covered.},

Abstract = {Blended learning which is an advanced teaching strategy integrating
   techniques used in Small Private Online Courses (SPOCs) and those in
   traditional classrooms is increasingly adopted in many courses. The aim
   of this study is to evaluate whether blended learning in a Practical
   Introductory Engineering Course can improve students' performance,
   classification and satisfaction. To do so, a blended learning mode was
   designed and the blended learning group (182 students) of the academic
   year 2019-2020 was compared with the traditional learning group (226
   students) of the academic year 2018-2019 in terms of the students'
   performance and classification. Besides, we evaluated the students'
   satisfaction in blended learning using designed questionnaires. The
   results show that students in the blended learning group have better
   performance than those in the traditional group. Regardless of the
   practical operation scores or the final grades, the interval
   distribution of scores in blended learning group was about 5 points
   higher than that of the traditional learning group. We also utilized a
   classifier based on our proposed deep learning model and verified
   through a comparative study that the classifier has the best performance
   among several existing models. The results also reveal that comparing
   with traditional learning, the accuracy of using the proposed model to
   classify students in blended learning was improved by 16.45\%. As far as
   the questionnaire survey is concerned, most students had a positive view
   of employing the blended learning in the course. Overall, these results
   can serve as reference and guidance for future engineering practice
   courses.},

Abstract = {Digital self-efficacy and the amount of perceived support from the
   school can improve teachers' motivation to increase the use of
   information and communication technology (ICT) in the classroom.
   Likewise, attitude, perception, gender, and experience of mathematics
   teachers are factors that influence their use of ICT. This study aimed
   to analyze the profiles of mathematics teachers, determine the existence
   of differences between them, and identify the sample size necessary to
   detect significant differences. A total of 73 high school teachers were
   included in this cross-sectional study. Teaching practice, ICT
   resources, ICT in the classroom, skills, and uses of ICT were assessed
   through a validated 19-item questionnaire. Statistical analysis revealed
   that the required sample to detect significant differences was 53
   subjects. Further, 67.21\% of the mathematics teachers surveyed in
   Melilla were younger than 40 years of age, and 62.30\% had less than 6
   years of teaching experience. In addition, 81.97 and 47.54\% of
   mathematics teachers stated that they consider themselves to have
   sufficient ICT resources at home for their work and in the classroom,
   respectively. Through different clusters, mathematics teachers can be
   identified and classified according to their motivational and competence
   profiles in pedagogical and digital areas. In addition, young teachers
   with some teaching experience had positive perceptions of technology, as
   reflected by high scores in the motivation indicator for ICT.},

Abstract = {Background and Purpose: Web conferencing, interactive video
   conferencing, and classroom and lecture capture are widely used in
   pharmacy education. This study aimed to determine student pharmacists'
   receptiveness to a virtually facilitated outpatient pharmacy practice
   laboratory course.
   Educational Activity and Setting: A new course design was implemented
   for a first-year (P1) laboratory course utilizing Zoom, an
   internet-based ``cloud{''} video and chat conference room, for
   communication across two campuses. Physical campus attendance and Zoom
   connection were required for each laboratory session. Students
   voluntarily and anonymously completed a survey at course start and
   conclusion to evaluate course design and impact on student learning.
   Findings: The pre-survey was completed by 77 students (82\%) and 82
   students completed the post-survey (87\%). Students agreed or strongly
   agreed that virtual facilitation did not hinder learning and disagreed
   or strongly disagreed that a facilitator needs to be physically present
   to simplify learning. Students concluded there is no difference in
   virtual or in person facilitator communication. While students agreed
   the experience enabled development of problem-solving skills and
   fostered self-awareness and responsibility for self-learning, this was
   not statistically significant.
   Summary: These results provide insight into students' perceptions of a
   virtually facilitated laboratory course design. This may be an
   alternative to live facilitation without impacting student development
   in the areas of problem solving, self-awareness, and responsibility for
   self-learning. Schools and colleges of pharmacy might consider virtual
   laboratory facilitation as an innovative course design.},

Title = {Online class or flipped-jigsaw learning? Which one promotes academic
   motivation during the COVID-19 pandemic?},
Journal = {BMC MEDICAL EDUCATION},

Abstract = {Background Due to the progress in COVID-19, education has undergone a
   huge change all around the world, leading all universities to move
   towards distance learning. In this context, the majority of instructors
   tend to make use of the educational methods that maintain and improve
   students' motivation and, consequently, promote their academic
   performance. This study aimed to compare the effects of synchronous
   online class and the combination of flipped and jigsaw methods on
   students' academic motivation. Methods This quasi-experimental study was
   conducted on 84 BSc nursing students who had entered Shiraz University
   of Medical Sciences in two different years. One group was educated in a
   synchronous online class, while the other group was educated using a
   combination of flipped and jigsaw methods. Both classes were enrolled in
   online classes due to the COVID-19 pandemic. The participants' academic
   motivation was evaluated using Harter's Academic Motivation Scale.
   Results The results revealed no significant difference in the intrinsic
   and extrinsic dimensions of academic motivation in the synchronous
   online class group before and after the intervention. However, a
   significant increase was observed in the mean scores of academic
   motivation (p = 0.002) and its intrinsic (p = 0.003) and extrinsic (p =
   0.031) dimensions in the flipped-jigsaw method group after the
   intervention. Moreover, the mean scores of academic motivation (p =
   0.007) and its intrinsic (p = 0.038) and extrinsic (p = 0.010)
   dimensions were significantly higher in the flipped-jigsaw method group
   compared to the synchronous online class group after the intervention.
   Conclusions Since the COVID-19 pandemic has led educational institutions
   to use virtual education methods, the combination of flipped and jigsaw
   methods may improve students' academic motivation in distance learning.},

Abstract = {Background The COVID-19 pandemic has created multiple challenges for
   health care, social and economic systems worldwide, but also for school
   and university teaching. Most learning has been shifted to online
   classes. So far, it is unclear whether these changes are well received
   within the student body. Objectives The aim of this study was the
   evaluation of a newly developed online-based teaching concept for
   medical students studying radiology during the COVID-19 pandemic.
   Materials and methods The concept consisted of 12 online seminars of the
   11-week course ``Imaging Procedures{''}, which were combined with 31
   prerecorded video presentations. Five weeks after the start of the
   summer term, we conducted an anonymous online survey, which consisted of
   12 questions and a box for additional comments. Furthermore, we analysed
   the number of requests of the presentations, the duration and the
   average viewing time. Results In all, 110 of 213 students (51.6\%)
   completed the survey; 72.7\% stated that the new teaching concept drew
   their interest for radiology, 78.2\% agreed that it incited self-study
   as well as would facilitate time- and place-independent learning
   (95.5\%). The majority indicated that the time investment for the video
   presentations was appropriate, but shorter video sections would simplify
   the learning process (70.9\%) and the ideal timeframe would be 10-20
   min. The majority (80.9\%) agreed that the concept should be maintained
   in upcoming semesters. Conclusions This newly developed online-based
   teaching concept enjoys high acceptance rates among students. It offers
   advantages such as time- and location-independent learning,
   possibilities for self-study and should be maintained in upcoming
   semesters after the end of social distancing due to the COVID-19
   pandemic.},

Title = {Using PLS-SEM Model to Explore the Influencing Factors of Learning
   Satisfaction in Blended Learning},
Journal = {EDUCATION SCIENCES},

Abstract = {This research explores the influencing factors of learning satisfaction
   in blended learning. Three dimensions are proposed: perceived
   usefulness, perceived ease of use, and learning motivation. It studied
   how these variables affect students' learning satisfaction. The research
   hypotheses are: (1) Perceived ease of use positively affects perceived
   usefulness; (2) Perceived usefulness and perceived ease of use will have
   a positive effect on learning motivation; (3) Learning motivation
   positively affects learning satisfaction; (4) Perceived usefulness has a
   positive intermediary effect on the relationship between perceived ease
   of use and learning motivation. Participants included 173 freshmen who
   took the first-year interactive game design course at Ling Tung
   University in Taichung, Taiwan. The questionnaire survey method is
   applied in this research to analyze the relationship between the
   variables and verify the hypothesis based on the collected 173 valid
   questionnaires. The partial least square method structural equation
   model (PLS-SEM) is used to carry out structural equation modeling to
   study the relationship between latent variables. It explains that the
   perceived ease of use affects the perceived usefulness. Perceived
   usefulness and perceived ease of use have a positive impact on learning
   motivation. Learning motivation has a positive impact on learning
   satisfaction. Perceived usefulness as an intermediary factor of
   perceived ease of use has an indirect impact on learning motivation. The
   contribution of this research is to provide empirical evidence and
   explain what factors may affect learning satisfaction. Some other
   related factors that may affect learning satisfaction should be taken as
   the factors that teachers should pay attention to when implementing
   blended learning.},

Abstract = {Background Recent engineering education research has found improved
   learning outcomes when instructors engage students actively (e.g.,
   through practice problems) rather than passively (e.g., in lectures). As
   more instructors shift toward active learning, research needs to
   identify how different types of activities affect students' cognitive
   engagement with concepts in the classroom. In this study, we investigate
   the effects of prompting novice students to draw when solving problems,
   a professional practice of engineers. Purpose We investigate whether
   implementing instructional prompts to draw in an active learning
   classroom (a) increases students' use and value of drawing as a
   problem-solving strategy and (b) enhances students' problem-solving
   performance. Method We compared survey data and exam scores collected in
   one undergraduate class that received prompts to draw in video lectures
   and in-class problems (drawing condition) and one class that received no
   drawing prompts (control condition). Results After drawing prompts were
   implemented, students' use and value of drawing increased, and these
   effects persisted to the end of the semester. Students were more likely
   to draw when provided drawing prompts. Furthermore, students who
   received prompts outperformed students who did not on exam questions
   that target conceptual understanding. Conclusions Our findings reveal
   how implementing drawing prompts in an active learning classroom may
   help students engage in drawing and solve problems conceptually. This
   study contributes to our understanding of what types of active learning
   activities can improve instructional practices in engineering education.
   Particularly, we show how prompts that foster authentic engineering
   practices can increase cognitive engagement in introductory-level
   engineering courses.},

Abstract = {Educators have indicated that a good flipped learning design has the
   potential to enable teachers to use the class time effectively for
   conducting higher-order thinking activities and enhancing the
   interactions among peers and teachers. Several previous studies have
   also pointed out the importance of employing proper learning strategies,
   such that students' learning performance would meet the expectations of
   both the pre- and in-class activities of flipped learning. In this
   study, an interactive problem-posing guiding strategy was proposed to
   guide students to understand the concepts of problemposing by the use of
   multiple choice options before class, and to engage them in effective
   problem-posing activities during class. To examine the effectiveness of
   the proposed learning mode, a flipped learning system was developed and
   an experiment was conducted in a natural science learning activity in an
   elementary school. The participants were two classes of fifth graders of
   an elementary school, a total of 56 students, with one class as the
   experimental group and the other as the control group. The students in
   the experimental group adopted the interactive problem-posing guiding
   strategy in the flipped learning mode, while the control group used the
   conventional flipped learning mode. The experimental results confirmed
   that the flipped learning activity with the interactive problem-posing
   guiding strategy was more effective in terms of learning achievement,
   self-efficacy, and deep approaches to learning science in the natural
   science course than the conventional flipped learning method. It also
   confirmed the importance of integrating the stepwise learning strategy
   (e.g. guided problem-posing and collaborative problem-posing) into
   flipped learning to support students' pre- and in-class learning.},

Title = {Flipped Learning to improve students' motivation in Physical Education},
Journal = {ACTA GYMNICA},
Year = {2021},
Volume = {51},
Month = {JUL 15},
Abstract = {Background: Active methodologies have emerged in which they focus their
   importance of the teaching-learning process in students and not only on
   the result. In this way, research has been conducted using the active
   methodology Flipped Learning (FL) in all areas of Primary, Secondary and
   Higher Education. Objective: The current study aims to analyze the
   effect on student motivation after an intervention with the FL teaching
   technique, using a Parkour Didactic Unit in primary school students.
   Methods: One hundred students of 6th grade of Primary (11-12 years old)
   participated in this study, of which, 45 were girls and 55 were boys. It
   was randomly decided that 6 degrees B and 6 degrees D would follow the
   teaching styles that were already used in the center regularly (TRAD
   group) and otherwise, the 6 degrees A and 6 degrees C groups used FL
   teaching technique by watching videos created by the principal
   investigator for the present investigation (FLIP group). The Motivation
   Questionnaire in Physical Education in primary education and personal
   interview were applied before and after intervention. Results: The
   results showed an increase of intrinsic motivation (p < .001),
   identified motivation (p < .001) and introjected motivation (p < .001)
   in FLIP group. Moreover, external motivation, as well as the amotivation
   of the students, has decreased after the intervention. Regarding the
   TRAD group, a significant decrease in intrinsic motivation and
   identified motivation was observed. According to qualitative results,
   the most remarkable thing is that students consider FL as more fun,
   efficient, accepted and motivating. Conclusions: Intrinsic motivation
   increased significantly and amotivation values decrease in FL group. FL
   approach allows using more time in Physical Education classes and,
   consequently, it is perceived as more fun for the students.},

Abstract = {Flipped learning is a pedagogical approach in which the traditional way
   of instruction is inverted by presenting new concepts and subject
   matters before class and allocating more class time to collaborative,
   individualized, and differentiated learning. Recently, the use of
   flipped learning has become popular in the context of learning English
   as a second/foreign language (ESL/EFL). However, no quantitative
   synthesis has been conducted on the results of flipped ESL/EFL studies
   so far. Therefore, with this gap in our mind, we conducted a
   meta-analysis that consisted of 69 between-subject design studies in the
   field of ESL/EFL, in which we compared the flipped and lectured-based
   classrooms in improving students' achievements. In order to interpret
   the results, we used the field-specific benchmark for L2 research
   proposed by Plonsky and Oswald (2014) in Mod Lang J 100: 538-553, 2021.
   We found that the influence of flipped learning on students'
   achievements was large and positive. Also, the findings of moderator
   analysis indicated that the flipped group performed better when some
   extra activities and exercises were accompanied by pre-class materials.
   We conclude that although flipped learning is new in the ESL/EFL field,
   it has the potential to improve students' achievements if appropriately
   designed and implemented. Moreover, since flipped learning is in its
   fledgling state in the ESL/EFL field, more empirical evidence and
   research is required in all educational levels to examine its
   effectiveness, more specifically regarding design and implementation.},

Abstract = {Background: Education in recent years has evolved in leaps and bounds.
   Traditional pedagogical methods may still be useful, but education today
   revolves more around encouraging the students to awaken their curiosity
   and desire to learn. Many new methods have emerged using technology in
   the classroom, giving education a new lease of life allowing us to
   approach ideas in new ways. Aim: This survey was conducted to assess the
   awareness of new teaching methods among the Oral Medicine and Radiology
   (OMR) faculties in Tamil Nadu and Pondicherry and their perception
   towards practice of new teaching methods in dental curriculum. Methods:
   Purposive sampling was done and self-administered, online questionnaire
   was sent to the faculties of Oral Medicine and Radiology in Tamil Nadu
   and Pondicherry to collect data regarding the interest and practice of
   new teaching methods and their perception of new teaching methods
   towards enhancement of students skills. Results: A response rate of
   94.56\% was obtained. About 92\% of faculty members found that new
   methods will be effective in dental education but only 56\% of teaching
   faculty felt that it would replace the conventional methods. The
   faculties agreed that various skills of the students will improve with
   new teaching methods. Statistically significant difference (P < 0.05)
   was found among the various designations of OMR teaching faculties and
   their perception towards enhancing the students skills. Conclusion:
   Thus, the faculties were aware and accepted that the new teaching
   methods were the need of the hour to improve students skills,
   independent learning and engage them in continuous learning.},

Abstract = {Objectives The COVID-19 pandemic presents a challenging situation for
   dental education, with school closures worldwide. While practical
   sessions are important for the acquisition of clinical skills, few
   studies have examined the role of home-based simulation learning (HBSL).
   This study aims to identify key aspects of simulation design and factors
   associated with students' satisfaction with HBSL.
   Methods During a ``circuit-breaker{''} period in Singapore, the Nanyang
   Polytechnic School of Health \& Social Sciences (Oral Health Therapy)
   distributed portable manikins and instruments to students and staff for
   use at home. Synchronous teaching sessions with real-time feedback were
   carried out over the Zoom teleconferencing platform. A cross-sectional
   survey of students was conducted after 3 weeks of the HBSL program.
   Multiple linear regression analyses were carried out to assess the
   association between satisfaction with domains of simulation design and
   overall satisfaction with HBSL.
   Results The top three factors of importance to students in HBSL were
   feedback and guided reflection, support, and objectives and information.
   Final-year students expressed higher levels of overall satisfaction and
   self-confidence following HBSL than first-year students. Satisfaction
   with the objectives (beta = 0.42, 95\% CI 0.26-0.57), support (beta =
   0.27, 95\% CI 0.11-0.42), and problem-solving (beta = 0.28, 95\% CI
   0.10-0.46) domains in the Simulation Design Scale were positively
   associated with overall student satisfaction and self-confidence in
   learning.
   Conclusion The findings can aid educators in the design of future HBSL
   programs, with a focus on areas of simulation design that are of
   importance to students.},

Title = {Effectiveness of technology-enhanced learning to improve periodontics
   educational outcomes: A systematic review},
Journal = {JOURNAL OF DENTAL EDUCATION},

Month = {JUL},
Abstract = {Objectives Technology-enhanced learning (TEL) has been suggested as a
   suitable learner-centered pedagogical approach in dental education.
   However, the results of TEL effectiveness in periodontics education are
   controversial. Therefore, this systematic review aimed to evaluate the
   effectiveness of TEL to improve educational outcomes in the periodontics
   field compared to traditional learning methods.
   Methods The search comprised randomized controlled trials (RCTs) and
   crossover studies that were related to periodontics education from the
   following databases: MedLine, PsycINFO, Eric, Scopus, EMBASE, and Web of
   Science. Two authors independently performed study selection, data
   extraction, and assessed risk of bias. Kirkpatrick's 4-level evaluation
   model was used to evaluate educational outcomes.
   Results From 1642 studies, after applying inclusion criteria, 7 studies
   remained for analysis. On level 1 (Reaction), undergraduate dental
   students reported positive attitudes related to TEL. On level 2
   (Learning), 3 studies found that TEL improved knowledge gain compared to
   traditional learning methods. Three other studies did not show any
   difference between TEL and conventional learning methods, and one found
   that traditional learning methods presented superior results. On level 3
   (Behavior), 1 study found that TEL application improved students'
   performance. On level 4 (Results), 5 studies suggested that the
   implementation of TEL would improve educational outcomes in periodontics
   education if combined with traditional learning methods.
   Conclusion The findings showed that the exclusive use of TEL does not
   significantly improve periodontics educational outcomes when compared to
   traditional learning methods. However, the combination of TEL and
   traditional learning methods can be the key to enhancing periodontics
   education.},

Abstract = {Introduction: The use of problem-based video podcasts in health sciences
   education is limited. Principles of Pharmacokinetics is an introductory
   course that establishes a foundation for understanding pharmacokinetic
   concepts. The primary objective was to determine the impact of
   problem-based video podcasts in an introductory pharmacokinetics course
   on student learning.
   Methods: Problem-based video podcasts were implemented in an
   introductory pharmacokinetics course in spring 2015. Student pharmacists
   in the first professional year enrolled in the course during spring
   2015, 2016, and 2017 were included in the study with students enrolled
   in the course in spring 2014 serving as the control group. The primary
   outcome was the impact of problem-based video podcasts on student
   learning as assessed by student performance on the final exam. Other
   outcomes included student utilization of the video podcasts, overall
   course grades, and student perceptions of learning using video podcasts.
   Results: A total of 633 students in four academic years were included
   for analysis. Final exam scores were significantly higher in spring 2015
   and 2016 compared to 2014. The 2017 final exam scores were similar to
   the final exam scores in 2014. Students perceived the problem-based
   video podcasts enhanced their ability to apply concepts to a patient
   case, reinforced concepts from lectures, and improved their
   understanding of clinical pharmacokinetics.
   Conclusion: The use of problem-based video podcasts is an innovative
   method to augment learning outside of the traditional class time and may
   enhance learning without replacing direct instructor-student contact.
   Students reported the video podcasts improved their understanding of
   clinical pharmacokinetics.},

Title = {Impact of Lecture Video Acceleration in a Flipped Introductory
   Engineering Course},
Journal = {INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF ENGINEERING EDUCATION},
Year = {2018},
Volume = {34},

Pages = {1863-1875},
Abstract = {As demand for engineers grows, emphasis is increasingly placed on
   introductory engineering courses to engage, educate, and retain
   students. Team-Based Learning (TBL) is a pedagogy that shifts
   instruction from a lecture-based paradigm to a structured learning
   sequence that includes individual preparation outside of class followed
   by active, in-class problem-solving exercises completed by student
   teams. As part of the individual preparation, students may watch
   recorded videos of lectures, often at an accelerated speed. While the
   acceleration of videos has the potential to increase students' learning
   efficiency, the impact on comprehension is unclear. Two studies were
   conducted to understand students' viewing habits of video lectures, and
   to determine whether video acceleration and training can increase
   students' learning efficiency without significant loss in comprehension.
   A preliminary study surveyed university students from an introductory
   engineering course on Decision Support Systems and Computer Programming
   about their lecture video viewing habits, and found that a sizable
   subset of students watch videos at an accelerated rate. The main study
   placed students in one of three groups that practiced watching videos at
   1X (n = 16), 2X (n = 16), and 3X speed (n = 15), and then tested
   comprehension at 3X. Results from the preliminary survey revealed that
   approximately 30\% of the students watched the preparatory videos at
   accelerated speeds in their introductory engineering course. Results
   from the main study showed that participants were able to accelerate
   videos up to 2X and with practice, able to maintain the same
   comprehension levels as participants watching at normal (1X) speed,
   whose comprehension levels decreased over time. However, 3X acceleration
   lowered comprehension, regardless of practice at higher speeds.},

Title = {Comparison of a Self-Care Therapeutics Course Taught in the P1 vs the P2
   Year},
Journal = {JOURNAL OF PHARMACY PRACTICE},
Abstract = {Objective: The objective of this study was to compare student learning
   outcomes, behaviors, and attitudes in a non-prescription drug and
   self-care therapeutics course taught in the second professional (P2)
   year vs the first professional (P1) year at one pharmacy school.
   Methods: Mean performance of students by class year on case
   consultations and exam scores was compared. Focus groups with student
   volunteers and course teaching assistants (TAs) and one-on-one
   interviews with a subset of instructors were conducted by an outside
   educational evaluation specialist to capture perceptions of student
   learning behaviors and attitudes. Results: There was no difference in
   performance on graded case consultations (mean difference = 0.16, P =
   .74, 95\% CI {[}-0.77 to 1.09]), mid-term examinations (mean difference
   = 0.53, P = .62, 95\% CI {[}-1.59 to 2.65]), or final examinations (mean
   difference = 0.73, P = .57, 95\% CI {[}-1.83 to 3.30]) between P1 and P2
   students. P1 students reported being more consistent in completing
   pre-class readings and in feeling less distracted by other courses than
   did P2 students. Students, TAs, and instructors consistently spoke about
   advantages of the course in the P1 year (e.g., less stress and greater
   eagerness to learn and apply skills at work) and disadvantages in the P2
   year (e.g., distraction from concurrent P2 integrated
   pharmacotherapeutics course and tension between real-world experience
   and constraints of grading rubric). Conclusion: P1 students, despite one
   year earlier in their curriculum, performed equally well as P2 students.
   All stakeholders agree that the advantages of teaching a self-care
   course on students' learning behaviors and attitudes in the P1 year
   outweigh disadvantages.},

Title = {The refinement of flipped teaching implementation to include retrieval

Abstract = {There has been growing evidence that flipped teaching (FT) can increase
   student engagement. Traditional lecture-based teaching (TT) method was
   compared with FT and FT combined with retrieval practice (FTR) in a
   400-level Exercise Physiology course over eight semesters. In the FT
   format, lecture content was assigned for students to prepare before
   class along with an online quiz. ailing class, the assigned content and
   quiz questions were reviewed. and a team-based learning (TBL) activity
   was conducted. Students found FT implementation three times a week (FT3)
   to be overwhelming, which led to reconfiguration of the VI' design to
   minimize the quiz and TBL sessions to one per week. Subsequently, FT was
   combined with retrieval exercises (FTR), which involved recalling
   information. thus promoting retention. The students in the FTR format
   were given weekly quizzes in class, where no notes were allowed, which
   affected their quiz grade negatively compared with FT (P < 0.0001).
   Again, no resources were permitted during FTR's TBL sessions. When exam
   scores were compared with TT, student performance was significantly
   greater (P < 0.001) with the FT and FTR methods, suggesting these
   methods are superior to TT. While both male and female students
   benefited from FT and FTR methods compared with TT (P = 0.0008), male
   students benefited the most ((P = 0.0001). Similarly. when the exam
   scores were organized into upper and lower halves, both groups benefited
   from FT and FTR (P < 0.0001) approaches. In conclusion, both FT and FTR
   methods benefit students more compared with TT, and male students are
   impacted the most.},

Title = {Enhancing the odds of adopting e-learning or community-focused
   experiential learning as a teaching practice amongst university faculty},
Journal = {HELIYON},

Abstract = {Identifying the optimal approach for motivating faculty to adopt
   teaching innovation is important, given that broad-scale initiatives can
   utilize an inordinate amount of time and resources. Using a quantitative
   approach, we evaluate policy actions that are most strongly associated
   with the adoption of either e-learning or community-focused experiential
   learning, over a five-year period in a single institution. Comparisons
   between adopters and non-adopters affirm the relevance of previously
   documented facilitators and barriers. However, logistic regression
   analyses demonstrate that actions that promote a supportive
   institutional culture (such as, an institutional plan, committee
   involvement, professional development and logistical support) as well as
   faculty perceptions and beliefs (i.e., ``using new methods is not risky
   for student learning{''}; confidence and self-efficacy with respect to
   implementation), are strongly associated with the adoption of either
   e-learning (n = 118) or community-focused experiential learning (n =
   97). In contrast, funding and professional dimensions (i.e., workload,
   historical precedence, and the institutional promotion of the innovation
   with respect to academic freedom) are weakly associated with adoption.
   The results not only provide a fine-grained analysis of current
   assumptions regarding the necessary conditions for implementing
   organizational change in the university context, but also suggest an
   approach that reinforces and sustains the adoption of teaching
   innovation over the long term. Theoretical and practical implications
   are discussed in reference to models of organizational change, faculty
   motivation and approaches to institutionalizing teaching innovation.},

Title = {The impact of perceived enjoyment on team effectiveness and individual
   learning in a blended learning business course: The mediating effect of
   knowledge sharing},
Journal = {AUSTRALASIAN JOURNAL OF EDUCATIONAL TECHNOLOGY},
Year = {2020},
Volume = {36},
Number = {1},
Pages = {126-141},
Abstract = {With advances in information and communication technology, blended
   learning has become an effective approach for highlighting disciplinary
   effects and accommodating student population diversity. Faculty members
   in business schools have developed an understanding of design approaches
   that have evolved and selected appropriate designs for blended courses.
   This study combines the approaches of blended and team-based learning to
   support a management course. This study involved 197 undergraduate
   business students from two Taiwanese universities. Their perceptions of
   the course were elicited through survey questions. Subsequent
   quantitative analysis has revealed the relationships among learners'
   perceived enjoyment, knowledge sharing, team effectiveness, and
   perceived individual learning. This study documents education benefits,
   pedagogical implications, and research limitations in applying this
   approach to business education. Those points are developed along with
   recommendations regarding future research directions.
   Implications for practice or policy:
   In blended team-based learning settings, educators need to consider the
   importance of creating an enjoyable learning environment in facilitating
   students' knowledge sharing processes and team-based work.
   Educators should keep investigating blended team-based and focus on
   building an effective mechanism for students to share knowledge in
   different learning phases in order to improve the quality of their team
   effectiveness and perceived individual learning.
   Higher education institutes should promote the benefits of applying
   blended team-based in business curricula as well as provide adequate
   facilities and training for business educators and students in order to
   ensure teaching and learning quality.},

Abstract = {This descriptive article describes the use of clinical case-based
   portfolios in histopathology teaching laboratories in conjunction with
   virtual microscopy not only to integrate histology and pathology
   disciplines for first and second year medical students but also to
   stimulate student engagement, promote self-directed and group-based
   learning and enhance student-to-student interaction in a structured
   manner. Portfolios consisted of PowerPoint files encompassing four to
   five clinical case studies relevant to the topics covered that week.
   Portfolios integrated study materials provided in the module-specific
   lectures, clinical skill lectures, and online interactive content. Two
   sets of portfolios, Individual and Group, were used. Individual
   Portfolios were completed by each student and uploaded prior to the
   laboratory session. Group Portfolios were completed by students working
   together in small groups during the laboratory session with minimal
   faculty assistance. The functional utility and acceptance of Individual
   and Group Portfolios among first- and second-year medical students was
   evaluated using electronic surveys and examination performances. Both
   first- and second-year students agreed that the use of portfolios in
   conjunction with virtual microscopy promoted understanding and
   encouraged discussion of the topics covered during the week and that
   group members worked well together and contributed to the completion of
   the portfolios. Performances on the Histology and Cell Biology and
   Pathology sections on the United States Medical Licensing
   Examination((R)) (USMLE (R)) remained consistent and in line with
   national averages. Overall, use of portfolios promoted peer teaching and
   contributed towards successful transition to the new system-based
   integrated curriculum with continued strong performance on the USMLE.},

Title = {The relation of dental students' learning styles to their satisfaction
   with traditional and inverted classroom models},
Journal = {BMC MEDICAL EDUCATION},

Abstract = {Background The authors' medical school has adopted an inverted classroom
   model (ICM) for physiology classes. This study aimed to determine
   students' learning styles and investigate the relationship between
   learning style and satisfaction with different instruction approaches
   and components of the ICM. Methods One hundred and twenty-one
   second-year dental students participated in this study, which had a
   77.6\% participation rate. The Kolb Learning Style Inventory, a
   sociodemographic questionnaire, and a satisfaction survey were
   administered after course completion. Results In both the traditional
   and ICM classes, most of the participants were convergers (56.9 and
   54\%) and assimilators (20.7 and 25.4\%), and the rest of the
   participants were accommodators (15.5 and 12.7\%) and divergers (6.9 and
   8\%). Learning style did not influence participants' satisfaction and
   did not predict their satisfaction with the traditional and ICM
   approaches. The satisfaction scores for the four components of the ICM
   were not significantly different by learning style. The mean
   satisfaction scores of the ICM approach were higher than those of the
   traditional approach in all learning style groups. All of the
   participants in the ICM class were more satisfied with the online and
   teacher-student interaction components than the student group discussion
   and presentation components. Conclusions Learning style may not be a
   potential contributing factor for optimizing the implementation of the
   ICM. Instead of focusing on learning styles, further research must
   investigate how to design more efficient online courses, determine
   appropriate levels of learning materials, provide more online
   instructional interaction, and help students overcome their feelings of
   fear.},

Abstract = {Objective: We sought to understand the experiences of surgical residents
   and faculty with treating culturally diverse patients, and identify
   recommendations for establishing and implementing structured cultural
   competency training.
   Summary Background Data: Cultural competency training for medical
   professionals could reduce healthcare disparities, yet is currently not
   a standard part of surgical residency training. Few studies have
   explored the perspectives of surgical residents and faculty on the
   skills needed to provide cross-cultural care.
   Study Design: A purposeful sample of surgical residents and faculty from
   4 academic institutions was recruited for semistructured qualitative
   interviews. We developed an in-depth interview guide and performed
   interviews to thematic saturation. Interviews were audio-recorded,
   transcribed, and analyzed using grounded theory methodology.
   Results: We interviewed 16 attending surgeons and 15 surgical residents.
   Participant demographics were: male (51.6\%), White (58.1\%), Black
   (9.7\%), Asian (22.5\%), and Hispanic (9.7\%). Four main themes emerged
   from the data: 1) aspects of culture that can inform patient care; 2)
   specific cultural challenges related to surgical care, including
   informed consent, pain management, difficult diagnoses and refusal of
   treatment, emergency situations, and end-of-life issues; 3) need for
   culturally competent care in surgery to navigate cultural differences;
   4) perceived challenges and facilitators to incorporating cultural
   competency into the current training paradigm.
   Conclusions: Surgeons identified the need to provide better
   cross-cultural care and proposed tenets for training. Based on these
   findings, we suggest the development and dissemination of a cultural
   dexterity training program that will provide surgeons with specific
   knowledge and skills to care for patients from diverse sociocultural
   backgrounds.},

Abstract = {Introduction: Faculty motivations to use active learning have been
   limited to surveys evaluating faculty perceptions within active learning
   studies. Our objective in this study was to evaluate the relationship
   between faculty intrinsic motivation, extrinsic motivation, and
   demographic variables and the extent of active learning use in the
   classroom.
   Methods: An online survey was administered to individual faculty members
   at 137 colleges and schools of pharmacy across the United States. The
   survey assessed intrinsic and extrinsic motivations, active learning
   strategies, classroom time dedicated to active learning, and faculty
   development resources. Bivariate associations and multivariable stepwise
   linear regression were used to analyze the results.
   Results: In total, 979 faculty members completed the questionnaire
   (23.6\% response rate). All motivation variables were significantly
   correlated with percent active learning use (p < 0.001). Intrinsic
   motivation demonstrated the highest correlation (r = 0.447) followed by
   current extrinsic motivations (r = 0.245) and ideal extrinsic
   motivations (r = 0.291). Variables associated with higher intrinsic
   motivation included the number of resources used (r = 0.233, p < 0.001)
   and the number of active learning methods used in the last year (r =
   0.259, p < 0.001). Years of teaching experience was negatively
   associated with intrinsic motivation (r = -0.177, p < 0.001). Regression
   analyses confirmed the importance of intrinsic and extrinsic motivations
   in predicting active learning use.
   Discussion and conclusions: Our results suggest that faculty members who
   are intrinsically motivated to use active learning are more likely to
   dedicate additional class time to active learning. Furthermore,
   intrinsic motivation may be positively associated with encouraging
   faculty members to attend active learning workshops and supporting
   faculty to use various active learning strategies in the classroom.},

Title = {Flipped spotters learning model: An innovative student activity-based
   strategy. A preparation tool for anatomy practical examinations in
   medical education},
Journal = {ANATOMICAL SCIENCES EDUCATION},
Abstract = {The flipped spotters learning model is a modern student activity-based
   and learner-centered method in medical education. The aim of the study
   was to determine if the flipped spotters learning model improves
   students' learning. Participants were 1214 medical students of Polish
   (PD) and English (ED) divisions between 2013 and 2019 academic years at
   the University of Warmia and Mazury in Olsztyn, Poland. They were
   divided into a traditional group (control group) and a flipped spotters
   learning group (treatment group). Each flipped spotters learning group
   was asked to label anatomical structures on various specimens according
   to the structures name list prepared by the teacher on the multiple
   stations. The flipped spotters learning group leaders were instructed to
   take pictures with the appropriately marked structures on each of the
   human body prosections. After completion of the class, each flipped
   spotters team received photos for evaluation. In the flipped spotters
   learning model, the students strengthened their skills and knowledge by
   matching specimens independently as a form of practical laboratory
   activities. Students' performance in gross anatomy practical
   examinations between the group utilizing the flipped spotters learning
   model, and the group with the traditional teaching model was compared.
   Students participating in the treatment group achieved, on average 9.9
   percentage points higher among PD students, and 13.0 percentage points
   higher among ED students than the control group in all nine practical
   examinations (the effect size ranging from 0.47 to 0.95). The results
   suggest the positive impact of flipped spotters model on improving
   student's performance in the practical examinations.},

Title = {Asynchronous Delivery of a 400 Level, Partially Peer-Graded, Oral
   Presentation and Discussion Course in Systems Neuroscience for 60
   Students during the COVID-19 Pandemic},

Abstract = {A 400-level undergraduate oral presentation and discussion course in
   Systems Neuroscience was delivered asynchronously online during the
   COVID-19 pandemic. Enrolled students banked their narrated oral
   presentations in video format online then engaged in peer evaluation in
   virtual classrooms through the course website. Student delivered their
   oral presentation and responded to peer questions at their leisure and
   convenience, without the stress and anxiety associated with a ``live{''}
   performance delivery in front of their peers. A remote and
   asynchronously delivered course facilitated much more peer contact than
   ``live{''} versions of the course, which included a total of 62 uploaded
   presentations, 301 video responses uploaded to 1985 questions posed by
   peers, a total of 1159 feedback questionnaires submitted, 1066 rankings
   submitted of viewed oral presentations, and 1091 scores submitted
   evaluating the quality of questions posed by reviewers of oral
   presentations. A major drawback in the remote, asynchronous deliver was
   the enormity of peer engagement through the course website portal, which
   was mostly blind to the instructor because of the inability to
   effectively cross-index data linked between the student entries in the
   LEARN course website and the uploaded videos stored within BONGO Video
   Assignment tool. Nonetheless, a consistent engagement of students, and
   the positive feedback from enrolled students, indicate that a future
   version of this oral/written discussion course will be delivered, in
   part, remotely and asynchronously, even without a mandated delivery of
   the course by a remote and asynchronous method due to the COVID-19
   pandemic restrictions in 2020-2021.},

Abstract = {BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVES: There is a push to use classroom technology
   and active teaching methods to replace didactic lectures as the most
   prevalent format for resident education. This multisite collaborative
   cohort study involving nine residency programs across the United States
   compared a standard slide-based didactic lecture, a facilitated group
   discussion via an engaged classroom, and a high-fidelity, hands-on
   simulation scenario for teaching the topic of acute dyspnea. The primary
   outcome was knowledge retention at 2 to 4 weeks.
   METHODS: Each teaching method was assigned to three different residency
   programs in the collaborative according to local resources. Learning
   objectives were determined by faculty. Pre- and posttest questions were
   validated and utilized as a measurement of knowledge retention. Each
   site administered the pretest, taught the topic of acute dyspnea
   utilizing their assigned method, and administered a posttest 2 to 4
   weeks later. Differences between the groups were compared using paired
   t-tests.
   RESULTS: A total of 146 residents completed the posttest, and scores
   increased from baseline across all groups. The average score increased
   6\% in the standard lecture group (n=47), 11\% in the engaged classroom
   (n=53), and 9\% in the simulation group (n=56). The differences in
   improvement between engaged classroom and simulation were not
   statistically significant.
   CONCLUSIONS: Compared to standard lecture, both engaged classroom and
   high-fidelity simulation were associated with a statistically
   significant improvement in knowledge retention. Knowledge retention
   after engaged classroom and high-fidelity simulation did not
   significantly differ. More research is necessary to determine if
   different teaching methods result in different levels of comfort and
   skill with actual patient care.},

Title = {Development of a remote learning educational model for international
   Emergency Medicine trainees in the era of COVID-19},
Journal = {INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF EMERGENCY MEDICINE},

Abstract = {Background The COVID-19 pandemic has pressured post-graduate medical
   education programs to shift from traditional in-person teaching to
   remote teaching and learning. Remote learning in medical education has
   been described in the literature mostly in the context of local
   in-country teaching. International remote medical education poses unique
   challenges for educators, especially in low-middle income countries
   (LMICs) who need continued Emergency Medicine (EM) specialty
   development. Our objective is to describe the development and
   implementation of our remote educational curriculum for EM trainees in
   West Bengal, India, and to assess trainee satisfaction with our remote
   learning curriculum. Methods Our curriculum was developed by adapting
   remote learning techniques used in Western post-graduate medical
   education, conducting literature searches on remote learning modalities,
   and through collaboration with local faculty in India. We assessed
   resident satisfaction in our curriculum with feedback surveys and group
   discussions. Results The remote educational curriculum had overall high
   trainee satisfaction ratings for weekly livestream video lectures and
   throughout our monthly educational modules (median ratings 9-10 out of a
   10-point Likert scale). Qualitative feedback regarding specific lecture
   topics and educational modules were also received. Conclusions
   International remote education in LMICs poses a unique set of challenges
   to medical educators. Residents in our study reported high satisfaction
   with the curriculum, but there is a lack of clarity regarding how a
   remote curriculum may impact academic and clinical performance. Future
   studies are needed to further evaluate the efficacy and academic and
   clinical implications of remote medical education in LMICs.},

Title = {Practical Guidelines to Redesign Introductory Chemistry Courses Using a
   Flexible and Adaptive Blended Format},

Volume = {98},
Number = {12},
Pages = {3852-3863},

Abstract = {Incorporation of increased flexibility and adaptivity in courses can
   support freshmen with taking responsibility for their learning process.
   This is especially beneficial in the case of chemistry courses given
   their typically abstract nature and associated need for engaging in
   practice and higher order thinking. Blended learning can be used to
   achieve course flexibility and adaptivity, and increased student
   engagement. Adopting blended learning requires teachers to reconsider
   and redesign their course setup. The willingness for this will largely
   be dictated by perceived practicality, however. To this end, our aim is
   to develop practical redesign guidelines for flexible blended learning.
   Such guidelines need to be instrumental, congruent, and of `low cost'
   for a teacher. The resulting four guidelines were fine-tuned in two
   phases over 5 years using two introductory chemistry courses and
   incorporated various blended learning elements, such as slide-cast
   lectures, live lectures, formative in-cast multiple choice questions,
   tutorials, formative electronic tutorial questions, and student voting
   on the course schedule. The outcome of our multiyear endeavor was
   positive and sustainable by all metrics used, including online
   engagement by students, learning outcomes, and student evaluations. The
   teachers in phase II largely embraced the guidelines emerging from phase
   I, and in their course experienced them predominantly as practical while
   limitations were also identified. We hope that our guidelines and
   experiences can provide fellow teachers with a blueprint for practical
   incorporation of flexibility and adaptivity using blended learning in
   their chemistry courses.},

Title = {Determining the differences between online and face-to-face

Abstract = {Blended learning (B-learning) is a common practice in higher education,
   and various principles, characteristics, models, and strategies have
   been widely studied to improve B-learning performance. However, crucial
   differences in student-group interactions have not been explored between
   online and face-to-face sessions, the two key components of B-learning.
   This study applied social network analysis and thematic analysis to
   investigate the nature and differences of group interactions in these
   learning components of a B-learning course. A total of 53 respondents
   participated in this study and Baidu Post Bar was used as a tool to
   facilitate group interactions. A total of 604 dialogues comprising 5090
   posts were analyzed to identify the differences in group characteristics
   and interactions. A strong ``group-controlling{''} pattern was found in
   the online learning component, whereas an ``individual-controlling{''}
   pattern was found in the face-to-face mode. The depth of the
   interactions among students increased from the beginning to the middle
   of the class and reached a relatively stable state from the middle to
   the end of the class. The interaction in the classroom was more in-depth
   than that in the online learning mode. The dialogue clusters of students
   were stronger when the interactions focused on their real lives and were
   related to the subject of the course. Through the findings of this
   study, course designers and instructors of B-learning can gain better
   understanding of these interactions and further enhance student
   engagement and learning.},

Abstract = {Training models are designed for students to acquire knowledge at the
   individual level. Yet that knowledge is not usually applied later to
   increase organisational knowledge, as represented by the didactic
   resources available on a subject, nor to improve the effectiveness of
   the subject itself. In industrial, economic and production areas,
   knowledge is considered a part of an organisation's value. This takes
   into account the knowledge that is acquired by individuals while doing
   their work, which can both help improve the work of their peers and
   increase the overall knowledge available within the organisation. In
   this work, the student of an educational organisation is considered a
   person who is able to share the knowledge they have acquired on a given
   subject so that other students can improve their learning. This work
   proposes the integration of the classic Flip Teaching model that usually
   involves students/trainees viewing lectures outside of class time while
   class time is dedicated to practical exercises, with a knowledge spiral
   that involves ontological and time dimensions. This integration allows
   to convert individual knowledge into organisational knowledge through
   the resources that are created by students over the continuous editions
   of a training course. A quasi-experimental method proves that the new
   model, called Ontological Flip Teaching, increases the effectiveness and
   efficiency of the classic Flip Teaching model in the acquisition of the
   teamwork competence. The results are based on the students' opinion
   about workload and time spent to develop both models, the final grades
   and the student-student interactions.},

Abstract = {Aligned with the constructivist paradigm and catalyzed by the irruption
   of information technologies in the teaching-learning process,
   interactive teaching techniques such as Flipped Learning and Self and
   Peer Assessment are increasingly relevant in higher education. Both
   strategies share the quality of empowering students with responsibility
   for their own learning process, which depends on the development of
   strategic and autonomous learning. Although each one has evolved through
   separate trajectories in professional practice and in research; however,
   in this work, their paths meet under the framework of the Learning
   Oriented Assessment. The convergence of these interactive techniques
   came to reality as an instructional design with the main objective being
   to enhance the students' performance in applying concepts to solve
   Physics problems. To evaluate the impact of combining these techniques
   versus applying them separately, a research-action project was executed.
   A total of 157 students from Physics II courses at the Puebla campus of
   Tecnologico de Monterrey participated in this project. The empirical
   investigation showed that the group undergoing the combined techniques
   experienced a superior development of disciplinary competencies compared
   to the group where the techniques were applied individually. It was
   possible to verify that the best students (those with better academic
   performance) were better adapted to the method of Learning Oriented
   Assessment. The results did not show that the lower level academic
   students had differences in performance or level of achievement. Also,

Title = {Medical students' self-regulation of learning in a blended learning
   environment: a systematic scoping review},

Abstract = {Background Medical curricula are constantly evolving in response to the
   needs of society, accrediting bodies and developments in education and
   technology. The integration of blended learning modalities has
   challenged traditional methods of teaching, offering new prospects in
   the delivery of medical education. The purpose of this review is to
   explore how medical students adapt their learning behaviours in a
   Blended Learning environment to become more independent and
   self-regulated, in addition to highlighting potential avenues to enhance
   the curriculum and support student learning. Methods Using the approach
   described by Levac et al. (2010), which builds on Arksey and O'Malley's
   framework, we conducted a literature search of the following databases:
   MEDLINE (Ovid), ERIC, EBSCO, SCOPUS and Google Scholar, utilising key
   terms and variants of ``medical student', `self-regulated learning' and
   `blended learning'. The search yielded 305 studies which were further
   charted and screened according to the Joanna Briggs Institute. Results
   Forty-four studies were identified and selected for inclusion in this
   review. After full analysis of these studies, underpinned by
   Self-regulation theory, five major concepts associated with students'
   learning behaviours in a Blended Learning environment were identified:
   Scaffolding of instructional guidance may support self-regulated
   learning; Self-regulated learning enhances academic performance;
   Self-regulated Learning improves study habits through resource
   selection; Blended learning drives student motivation and autonomy; and
   the Cognitive apprenticeship approach supports Self-regulated learning.
   Conclusion This review uncovers medical students' learning behaviours
   within a Blended learning environment which is important to consider for
   curricular adaptations and student support.},

Abstract = {This study aims to investigate: (1) the construct validity of the
   ``Blended Learners' Online Component Challenges{''} BLOCC scale. (2) the
   internal reliability of the scale, and (3) the differences between
   blended learners' online component challenges according to different
   socio-demographic variables for Sport Science students. The sample of
   the study consisted of 263 students enrolled in blended learning classes
   at the School of Sport Sciences/University of Jordan. The BLOCC scale
   was used to collect the required data. The scale measures the four
   different online component challenges; (1) Self-Management Challenges
   (SMC), (2) Technology Competency and Literacy Challenges (TCLC), (3)
   Student Isolation Challenges (SIC), and (4) Technological Sufficiency
   and Complexity Challenges (TSCC). BLOCC scale proved to be valid and
   reliable (four items were omitted); The overall fit statistics for the
   hypothesized four factor model (chi(2) (df = 2.69) = 603.47, p < 0.001,
   (RMSEA) = .08 indicated a moderate and acceptable fit to the data
   representing the latent factor structure. Discriminant validity ranged
   between .53 and .70., Item-to-total correlation (.55 and .72), Cronbach
   Alpha (.72 and .86), and composite reliability (.74 -.95). Results of
   the study revealed that male students, students who have no internet
   accessibility, and those who have no previous experience in blended
   learning classes, all encountered significant higher levels of all BLOCC
   subscales. Older students (26-30 years old), and those with the lowest
   total income/ month (< 500 JD) encountered significant levels ofTLCC and
   TSCC. Students with lower literacy in computer skills level encountered
   significant differences in SMC, TLCC and TSCC. We encourage future
   studies to propose and implement curative approaches to face such online
   component challenges.},

Abstract = {Objectives The purpose of this study is to measure how the
   implementation of an online, preclinical hybrid curriculum impacts
   dental student clinic readiness, the outcomes of grades, critical
   thinking skills, and student and faculty perceptions respectively.
   Methods This longitudinal comparative and descriptive study used
   objective data and subjective (survey) data for 4 dental class cohorts.
   Groups A and B experienced a traditional lecture-based curriculum, while
   Groups C and D experienced a hybrid curriculum that was lecture-free and
   implemented active learning. The Health Sciences Reasoning Test (HSRT),
   an objective assessment, was used to measure students' critical thinking
   skills.
   Results Dental student outcomes have either remained steady or improved
   with the transition to a new hybrid curriculum. According to the student
   and faculty survey results, the hybrid curriculum promoted student
   learning, independence, critical thinking, initiative and
   self-motivation, and clinic practice readiness. Group C (N = 68) Total
   Online Platform mean scores demonstrated a significant and moderately
   strong correlation with the preclinical course mean grades (r = 0.68, P
   = 0.00). Group D HSRT (n = 63) for Attempt 1 (end of year 1) and Attempt
   2 (end of Year 2) paired T test resulted in HSRT Overall (mean
   difference = -2.27, SD = 7.21, t = -2.5, P = 0.02) for the second
   preclinical year.
   Conclusion The hybrid curricular approach afforded many benefits.
   Faculty took an active role in imparting knowledge when compared to the
   lecture hall. Having students immersed in continual assessment through
   an online adaptive platform and active learning promoted
   self-motivation, deeper learning, applied knowledge, and discouraged
   superficial memorization.},

Abstract = {Objective: This study aimed to compare the effect of blended and offline
   case-centred learning on medical nursing education for undergraduate
   nursing students.
   Background: Technological advancements are rapidly changing nursing
   education in higher educational settings. Educational reform, especially
   regarding methods of teaching, has been the focus of nursing educators
   in recent years.
   Design: The research was conducted between September 2018 and July 2019
   in China.
   Methods: Second-year undergraduate nursing students in two classes were
   enrolled for this study by cluster sampling. The study outcomes were
   academic performance and critical thinking ability, measured using the
   Critical Thinking Disposition Inventory-Chinese Version.
   Results: Students in the experimental class showed significantly higher
   improvements in academic performance than those in the control class.
   Compared with the control class, the pre-post difference in competency
   in critical thinking self-confidence in the experimental class was
   significantly greater (p = 0.037). In the experimental class, there was
   a significant improvement over the baseline in the dimension of critical
   thinking self-confidence (p = 0.022). In the control class, there was a
   significant improvement over the baseline in the total score (p = 0.029)
   and two of the seven dimensions: truth-seeking (p = 0.016) and
   systematicity (p = 0.005).
   Conclusions: The use of blended case-centred learning showed promising
   results in improving students' academic performance. Both blended and
   offline case-centred learning were indicated to be effective educational
   approaches to improve the critical thinking ability of undergraduate
   nursing students and could be implemented for other nursing subjects in
   the future.},

Title = {Implementation of a Blended Learning Module to Teach Handling,
   Restraint, and Physical Examination of Cats in Undergraduate Veterinary
   Training},
Journal = {JOURNAL OF VETERINARY MEDICAL EDUCATION},
Abstract = {Cats can be easily stressed in a clinical (training) setting and may
   show unpredictable reactions and patterns of defensive aggression. This
   can be a complicating factor in undergraduate veterinary training.
   Inexperienced veterinary students can evoke defensive feline behavior
   that negatively affects learning outcomes and animal welfare. As a
   result, restraint techniques and physical examination of cats was hardly
   practiced in pre-clinical training at Utrecht University. To overcome
   this, a new blended learning module was developed using a lecture on
   feline behavior; e-learning modules about feline behavior, handling,
   restraint, and physical examination skills; and redesigned practical
   sessions in which live animals and manikins were used. The aim of this
   study was to investigate how students' perceptions of competence and
   confidence changed regarding feline behavior, handling, restraint, and
   physical examination skills after the new module was implemented.
   Questionnaires were used for quantitative analysis, and focus groups
   were used for qualitative analysis. The results show that compared with
   students who followed the standard module, students who participated in
   the blended learning module scored higher in feeling confident with
   handling animals, feeling competent to perform physical examination on
   cats, and ability to assess whether a cat is stressed. Students with
   less experience with cats were more likely to show improvement in
   assessing a cat's stress level than students who had much experience
   with cats. The results demonstrate that the blended learning module
   improves students' learning outcomes regarding feline skills training
   and adds to reduction, refinement, and replacement of the use of live
   cats.},

Abstract = {While blended learning has been growing in popularity in recent years,
   the effectiveness of this procedure remains controversial. In this
   report, we assess the effectiveness of blended learning of embryology
   within international medical students. The participants were
   international medical students taking embryology in the Bachelor of
   Medicine and Bachelor of Surgery program. The blended learning group
   (BLG) consisted of students (n = 43) in the 2018-2019 academic year,
   taught with blended learning model via a customized small private online
   course (SPOC). The control traditional teaching group (TTG) consisted
   students (n = 48) in the 2017-2018 academic year, taught with
   traditional teaching model. Academic performance, including mean scores
   and passing ratios on the final exam of two groups were compared and
   analyzed with a t-test. In addition, a questionnaire directed toward
   evaluating student's perceptions with the blended learning was
   administered to students in BLG. The majority of students in BLG
   actively participated in online self-study activities and discussion in
   face-to-face class sessions. The mean score and passing ratio were
   significantly greater than those of students in TTG (p < 0.01). Results
   from the questionnaire revealed that the majority of BLG students felt
   that this method was beneficial for their learning of human embryology.
   The blended learning model, that integrates SPOC with face-to-face class
   lectures proved a more effective means for the teaching of embryology
   than the traditional lecture-based teaching model. This blended learning
   method may serve as a feasible model that can be readily applied for use
   in other medical courses.},

   following items were analysed as follows: the existence of curricular
   components in relation to the proposed themes, the most recurring
   denominations of curricular components, minimum and maximum workload,
   mandatory/optional classification, theoretical/practical teaching
   condition and in which year the curricular components were inserted.
   Results 367/424 (86.6\%) of dentistry courses in Brazil included at
   least one of the topics: management, entrepreneurship, leadership and
   marketing curricular components in their curriculum, whilst 57/424
   (13.4\%) did not have these curricular components in their curricular
   structure. The most frequent names were ``Management{''} 99 (45.21\%)
   and ``Entrepreneurship{''} 80 (36.5\%). There was a predominance of the
   ``theoretical method{''} and the number of hours varied considerably,
   with the most common course hours between 40 and 60 h. The majority of
   curricular components were inserted in the third to fifth year and
   offered on a compulsory basis. Conclusion Most curricular matrices of
   dentistry courses in Brazil had components related to the topics
   studied. However, due to the variety of curricular components' names,
   hours, periods of courses and different teaching methodologies, there is
   a need to redesign the teaching and learning process, defining
   educational and evaluation models with common curricular components.},

Title = {The Perception of Adolescents' Encounter With a Flipped Learning
   Intervention in Norwegian Physical Education},
Journal = {FRONTIERS IN EDUCATION},
Year = {2019},
Volume = {4},
Month = {OCT 14},
Abstract = {Objective: The discrepancy between observed and suggested levels of
   physical activity among adolescents urges society to obtain more
   knowledge and insight into how physical education (PE) in school can be
   beneficial for all individuals. The purpose of the present study was to
   examine the perceptions of adolescents of a flipped learning (FL)
   framework, applied to enhance student motivation and learning in PE.
   Methods: Ten students, from 13 to 17 years of age, were recruited from
   one secondary school and one upper secondary school from two different
   counties in Norway during the spring of 2016. The data were generated
   using semi-structured interviews, reduced, analyzed, and interpreted by
   constructivist grounded theory and stepwise-deductive induction
   traditions through constructivist and situated learning lenses.
   Results: It was demonstrated that the video format is preferred as
   preparation material over text material, that instructions on class
   activities are preferably given in the preparation material and not in
   class, and that the students did not report any negative aspects of FL.
   The students showed a positive perception of preparing for PE classes if
   the preparation material is in the form of a video, and if it has a
   clear connection to the upcoming class content and outcome aim(s). FL
   has a positive effect on student understanding and learning in PE, and
   FL produces a positive change in how students value PE.
   Conclusion: A clearly positive perception of FL in PE was demonstrated.
   FL seems to facilitate deep learning in PE, facilitated by motivation,
   knowledge, and the nature of the learning framework.},

Title = {Formative Feedback with In-Class Question Bank Utilization Improves
   Resident Satisfaction with General Surgery Didactics},
Journal = {ADVANCES IN MEDICAL EDUCATION AND PRACTICE},

Abstract = {Background: Formative feedback provides low-stakes opportunities for
   educational improvement. To enrich our basic science didactics,
   formative feedback measures were incorporated into our didactics using
   mobile devices.
   Materials and Methods: Lecture changes included institutional paid
   access to a commercial question bank, a 5-item in-class pre-didactic
   quiz curated from the question bank and taken on the resident's mobile
   device, and group discussion of quiz topics. An anonymous survey was
   sent to participating residents.
   Results: Overall response rate was 71\% among residents. All reported
   that the new lecture format was a valuable addition to the basic science
   curriculum (100\% Agree/Strongly Agree), and formative assessments
   provided valuable feedback about the progress of their learning
   (Strongly Agree = 42\%, Agree =58\%). All residents reported that
   in-class use of their mobile device for quizzes was convenient, with
   majority (84\%) preferring it over paper printouts. Residents were more
   motivated to study before lecture (Strongly Agree = 42\%, Agree =42\%),
   with majority also reporting the new format helped identify weaknesses
   in their knowledge-base (Strongly Agree = 58\%, Agree =33\%). While
   majority of residents agreed that quizzes motivated them to study more
   after lecture, a large portion disagreed (42\%). Majority of senior
   residents reported that the process of composing quizzes prior to
   lecture enriched their own learning (57\%) and helped them find gaps in
   their knowledge (71\%).
   Conclusion: Incorporating a commercial question bank within didactics
   gives general surgery residents formative feedback and encourages
   learning outside the classroom, leading to improved satisfaction with
   basic science didactics.},

Abstract = {Studies have been conducted on university students' continuous intention
   to learn online from the perspectives of learning motivation and
   capability, perceptions or attitudes, and online learning experiences.
   However, few have examined how the above factors will relate to each
   other and contribute to students' online learning intention. This
   research explored 94 university students' online learning attitudes and
   experiences in a blended course. The researchers investigated the
   changes in the participants' attitudes toward online learning and the
   relationships between their self-regulated learning capability, online
   interactions, attitudes, and online learning intention. These students
   participated in a pre- and post-survey at the beginning and end of the
   course. They also completed six weekly reports commenting on their
   learning activities of the week. At the end of the course, interviews
   were administered to eight participants to gather detailed information
   about their online learning experiences. It was found that (a) the
   participants' online learning attitudes were generally positive and
   increased when completing the course; and (b) the participants'
   continuous intention to learn online was significantly predicted by four
   self-regulatory factors and attitudes, mediated through perceived online
   social interactions. The analysis of the interviewees' further comments
   provided more insights about the potential factors contributing to their
   online learning attitude changes. The strategies for future online
   course design with a view of improving students' self-regulated learning
   skills are discussed in this paper.},

Abstract = {Dental education is incorporating computer-assisted
   design/computer-assisted manufacturing (CAD/CAM) into patient care
   delivery. The aim of this study was to determine if lean production
   methods applied to the preclinical phase of dental education would
   reduce the students' time (efficiency) to complete CAD/CAM indirect
   restorations (CAD/CAM IR) without compromising the desired quality of
   the CAD/CAM tooth preparations (effectiveness). In 2016, all third-year
   students at one U.S. dental school were randomly assigned to control and
   research groups (approximately 33 per group). The control group was
   taught using existing methods, while the course was redesigned to
   incorporate lean methods for the research group. Cycle times of the
   CAD/CAM IR process for both groups were collected and statistically
   analyzed to compare the effectiveness of the redesign. Standardized
   grading forms and tools were used to assess the quality of the CAD/CAM
   tooth preparations. The research group demonstrated significantly faster
   preparation times with both crowns and onlays (p<0.05) than the control
   group. The research group also produced CAD/CAM crown and onlay designs
   at a significantly faster pace than the control group (p<0.05). There
   was no significant difference between the control and research groups
   associated with the scanning process times (p>0.05) nor in the quality
   of the CAD/CAM tooth preparations (p>0.05). This study demonstrated that
   lean methods applied to pedagogy significantly decreased preparation and
   design times in a CAD/CAM restorative dentistry course without
   compromising the quality of the CAD/CAM tooth preparations.},

Title = {THE META-ANALYSIS OF THE STUDIES ABOUT THE EFFECTS OF FLIPPED LEARNING
   ON STUDENTS' ACHIEVEMENT},

Abstract = {The aim of this research is to analyze the effect of the flipped
   learning model on the academic success of students. In this research
   featuring a descriptive survey model, a quantitative research method has
   been used. While criterion sampling method has been used for selecting
   the sample of this research, meta-analysis has been used to analyze the
   data. The inclusion and exclusion criteria of this study were as
   follows: Sources must be an article or a thesis; be studies performed in
   Turkey; have been published between 2014 and 2018; be open-access; the
   sampling must consist of students; they must examine the effect of the
   flipped learning model on success; have an experimental design; have
   pretest/posttest experimenting and a control group design; include data
   such as pretest and posttest standard deviation, arithmetic average, and
   sample size. 14 articles and 11 theses, 25 studies formed the study
   group.Document review technique has been used as data collection
   technique. As data collection tool, ``meta-analysis form{''} developed
   by the researchers has been used. effect size values and unified effect
   sizes were calculated using Comprehensive Meta-Analysis (CMA)
   Software.After analysis was conducted based on the random effects model,
   it was determined that the effect of the flipped learning model on
   students' success is medium (Hedge's g=0.713). It has been seen that the
   variables of study type, educational level, and year do not have a
   significant effect on success (p>0.05). When the effect sizes were
   examined by year, newer studies had larger effect sizes, while the
   studies conducted with students at primary-secondary levels and with
   high school degrees had larger effect size averages.},

Abstract = {OBJECTIVE: We describe the effectiveness of the Jigsaw method in the
   instruction of residents in difficulty airway management.
   DESIGN: The residents were given a pre-Jigsaw instruction test and a
   self-assessment of their skills for bag-mask ventilation, Intubation,
   cricothyrotomy, and tracheostomy. After the completing the pre-test,
   they were randomly assigned tasks from A-D, with each letter
   corresponding to a section of reading from Cumming's Otolaryngology and
   related questions. The residents were given ten minutes to read their
   portion of the article, and then another ten minutes to discuss their
   section with others assigned the same responsibilities, thereby becoming
   ``experts.{''} Then, the ``experts{''} were assigned to a second group
   where they had ten minutes to teach their peers their designated
   material and learned from their peers the other designated material. A
   skill simulation lab was then performed involving intubation,
   cricothyrotomy, and tracheotomy. The residents were then given a
   post-Jigsaw instruction test and post simulation lab selfassessment of
   their skills for bag-mask ventilation, intubation, cricothyrotomy and
   tracheotomy.
   SETTING: Renaissance School of Medicine at Stony Brook University.
   PARTICIPANTS: General surgery, otolaryngology, plastic surgery, and oral
   and maxillofacial surgery residents.
   RESULTS: Post-Jigsaw tests scores a statistically significant increase
   in the number of correctly answered questions (P< 0.001) and residents
   reported a statistically significant increase in confidence in
   performing difficult airway skills.
   CONCLUSIONS: The Jigsaw method of learning is an effective alternative
   to tradition lecture-based methods.(C) 2020 Association of Program

Title = {Effectiveness of an adaptive eLearning intervention on dental students'
   learning in comparison to traditional instruction},
Journal = {JOURNAL OF DENTAL EDUCATION},
Year = {2020},
Volume = {84},
Number = {11},
Pages = {1294-1302},
Month = {NOV},
Abstract = {There is a great deal of excitement in higher education about the value
   of adaptive learning to personalize learning paths according to
   students' individual needs. The authors explored the impact of an
   Adaptive Learning Platform (ALP) on learning, by comparing learning
   effectiveness between dental students who used the ALP in a blended
   learning environment formatively and summatively compared with students
   who did not use the ALP (i.e., face-to-face), as measured by students'
   performance on the final exam in a single review preparatory course
   during the academic years 2013-2018. Paired t-tests showed significant
   improvement in post-test scores across different course instructional
   modalities (P< 0.01). The learning gain was greater for students who
   studied using the ALP summatively (t = 26.20) than those who used it
   formatively or studied using a face-to-face format (t = 13.10 and 14.13,
   respectively). Controlling for pre-test scores, analysis of covariance
   tests indicate that: (1) intervention groups (formative and summative
   ALP) scored significantly higher than the traditional group (B = 9.34
   points,P< 0.01, for summative ALP group) and (B = 4.47 points,P< 0.05,
   for formative ALP group), and (2) summative ALP group scored
   significantly higher than formative ALP group (B = 4.84 points,P< 0.05).
   This study provides empirical evidence that an adaptive learning
   intervention can have a significant impact on student learning
   performance. The success of any adaptive learning system relies mainly
   on sound instructional design. Technology will continue to grow at an
   overwhelming pace; the cautionary note the authors highlight is that
   conceptions of pedagogy, complemented by technology, must guide the
   development of adaptive learning systems.},

Abstract = {Background: This study examined the differences between team dynamics in
   nonflipped and flipped versions of a multisection team- and
   project-based sophomore engineering design course.
   Purpose/Hypothesis: We hypothesized that team dynamics in nonflipped and
   flipped course settings may reveal differences in student perceptions of
   team conflict, peer assessment, and team member satisfaction as well as
   possible relationships among these three variables.
   Design/Method: Students in both nonflipped and flipped settings
   completed a web-based Comprehensive Assessment of Team Member
   Effectiveness (CATME) SMARTER Teamwork survey. A series of ANCOVAs and
   path analyses were conducted to gain insights into team dynamics in both
   course environments.
   Results: Although no significant differences in team conflict were
   found, significantly higher levels of team member satisfaction and peer
   assessment rates were detected in the flipped course. The path analysis
   revealed relationships among team conflict, team member satisfaction,
   and peer assessment in both course versions. Differences in
   relationships among the unidimensional levels of team conflict and the
   other two variables were found between the nonflipped and flipped
   versions.
   Conclusions: The primary pedagogical implication of this research points
   to the affordance of the flipped course setting in providing sufficient
   time for student members to become cohesive teams. As part of the
   student experience, engineering educators are encouraged to allow time
   for team formation and development in addition to content learning.
   Instructors should provide guidance that helps teams and individuals
   understand themselves and others as well as create workflows to support
   their learning and team management.},

Abstract = {Purpose Student engagement is typically measured by class attendance and
   questionnaires. Learning management systems (LMS) provide additional
   sources of objective data that can evaluate student performance. This
   study compared dental students' self-report of course video viewing with
   LMS data.
   Methods Dental students in a 2018 flipped pediatric dentistry course
   were given a questionnaire after course completion that captured
   self-reported course video viewing. Student data and time spent on
   videos were extracted from the LMS and matched to the questionnaire.
   McNemar's test evaluated differences between self-reported and matching
   LMS data.
   Results Of the 109 enrolled students, 99 (91\%) completed the
   questionnaire. Most students self-reported that they watched more than
   half of the videos (71\%), re-watched at least once (89\%), and watched
   at times other than 8 a.m.-5 p.m. (80\%). Of the 104 students with data
   from the LMS, 40\% of students watched more than half of the videos,
   49\% re-watched at least one video, and 60\% watched between 8 a.m.-5
   p.m. LMS data showed 14 (13\%) students did not watch any videos.
   Significant differences were found between self-reported video viewing
   and matched LMS video data in (1) percentage of videos watched, (2)
   number of times videos were re-watched, and (3) most frequent time for
   watching the videos (p < 0.001 for all).
   Conclusion Technology is a tool that helps instructors more accurately
   track students' study habits compared to observation or self-report.
   When evaluating time spent watching videos via an LMS, students tend to
   overestimate the amount of viewing time.},

Abstract = {Although the implementation of blended learning in organic chemistry is
   rapidly growing, thus far, there are few studies published on the
   evaluation of supplemental types of blend in organic chemistry. This
   report covers a phenomenographic study that was designed to evaluate a
   supplemental type of blended learning approach implemented in a
   second-year organic chemistry course in a South African context. It
   offers a unique contribution in terms of catering to the needs of a
   diverse student body. Three open-ended questionnaires were used to
   probe: (1) students' perceptions of the learning support; (2) students'
   preferences for different types of learning support offered; and (3)
   students' suggestions for improvement. Semi-structured individual
   interviews were used to obtain clarity on some of the responses from the
   questionnaires. Analysis of students' responses revealed that the
   face-to-face component was highly valued as it gave the students the
   opportunity to ask questions and obtain answers in real time; the online
   component, especially Learnsmart, was found helpful for its flexibility
   and providing limitless opportunities to practice or revisit concepts.
   The discussion board was the least valued due to the overwhelming number
   of postings, and the students felt they were forced to participate in
   order to get marks. The students experienced the course as too
   fast-paced possibly reflecting cognitive overload, a potential weakness
   of the supplemental blend. The findings will be useful in many other
   contexts where the student body is diverse in terms of language
   proficiency and the level of preparation for the demands of organic
   chemistry as a discipline.},

Abstract = {Blended learning incorporates online learning experiences and helps
   students for meaningful learning through flexible online information and
   communication technologies, reduced overcrowded classroom presence, and
   planned teaching and learning experience. This study has conducted
   surveys of various tools, techniques, frameworks, and models useful for
   blended learning. This article has prepared a comprehensive survey of
   student, teacher, and management experiences in blended learning courses
   during COVID-19 and pre-COVID-19 times. The survey will be useful to
   faculty members, students, and management to adopt new tools and
   mindsets for positive outcomes. This work reports on implementing and
   assessing blended learning at two different universities (University of
   Petroleum and Energy Studies, India, and Jaypee Institute of Information
   Technology, Noida, India). The assessments prepare the benefits and
   challenges of learning (by students) and teaching (by faculty) blended
   learning courses with different online learning tools. Additionally,
   student performance in the traditional and blended learning courses was
   compared to list the concerns about effectively shifting the
   face-to-face courses to a blended learning model in emergencies like
   COVID-19. As a result, it has been observed that blended learning is
   helpful for school, university, and professional training. A large set
   of online and e-learning platforms are developed in recent times that
   can be used in blended learning to improve the learner's abilities. The

Title = {The effect of 3D-printed plastic teeth on scores in a tooth morphology
   course in a Chinese university},
Journal = {BMC MEDICAL EDUCATION},

Abstract = {BackgroundThe tooth morphology course is an important basic dental
   course. However, it is difficult to fully reflect the three-dimensional
   (3D) morphological characteristics of tooth structure in two-dimensional
   pictures in traditional textbooks. The aim of this study was to assess
   the effect of 3D-printed plastic model teeth in the teaching of tooth
   morphology.MethodsTwenty-two undergraduate students who matriculated at
   the School of Stomatology, the Fourth Medical University, in 2014 and 23
   who matriculated in 2016 participated in the study. Each student who
   matriculated in 2016 was given a full set of fourteen standard
   3D-printed plastic model teeth for use during the learning process, and
   an anonymous questionnaire was used to evaluate the usefulness of the
   3D-printed plastic model teeth from the perspective of the
   students.ResultsThere was no significant difference between the two
   groups in the scores of the theoretical examination or the total score.
   However, for the score of the sculpted gypsum teeth, the students who
   used the 3D-printed plastic model teeth in their studies scored
   significantly higher (P=0.002). More than 90\% of the students thought
   that the 3D-printed plastic model teeth were of great help or were very
   helpful for mastering the anatomy of teeth and for carving the gypsum
   teeth.ConclusionStandard 3D-printed plastic teeth can effectively assist
   students in learning tooth morphology by transforming two-dimensional
   pictures and descriptions in the textbook into a 3D conformation,
   effectively promoting students' learning and mastery of tooth morphology
   and structure. Additionally, the results suggest that 3D-printed plastic
   model teeth are of great help to the students in mastering and improving
   their carving skills.},

Title = {Using web-based gamified software to learn Boolean algebra
   simplification in a blended learning setting},

Abstract = {One of the fundamental topics in the education of students enrolled in
   computer-related degrees is that of Boolean algebra. This is because it
   allows the expression of several problems related to digital design,
   artificial intelligence, databases, compilers, and formal languages,
   among others, as a sequence of Boolean operations and variables, which
   can be dealt with by using Boolean algebra methods to optimize
   algorithms, minimize digital components, and so forth. This study
   presents a piece of web-based software, denominated as MiniBool, which
   has been developed with the objective of supporting the learning of
   Boolean algebra in a blended learning setting. This educational proposal
   gives students the opportunity to reinforce learning at any time and in
   any place. It additionally increases the learners' motivation by
   including gamification, through the use of a ranking that shows the
   students' level of participation. MiniBool was evaluated by means of a
   formal experiment, which was carried out with Discrete Mathematics
   students at a higher education institution in Mexico, where two groups
   were formed randomly: A control group, whose members attended classes
   and reinforced their knowledge in a traditional manner with a pencil and
   paper, and an experimental group, which learned in a blended learning
   context, receiving the same classes as the control group, but
   reinforcing what they had learned using MiniBool. The statistical
   results obtained indicate that the use of MiniBool has a positive and
   motivating effect on learning and that a greater academic performance is
   achieved than when the traditional teaching-learning method is applied.},

Title = {Investigating the Effectiveness of YouTube as a Learning Tool among EFL
   Students at Baghdad University},

Abstract = {YouTube is not just a platform that individuals share, upload, comment
   on videos; teachers and educators can utilize it to the best maximum so
   that students can have benefits. This study aims at investigating how
   active and influential YouTube can be in the educational process and how
   it is beneficial for language teachers to enhance the skills of
   students. The study demonstrates different theoretical frameworks that
   tackle the employment of technology to enhance the learning/teaching
   process. It relies on the strategies of Berk (2009) for using multimedia
   media, video clips in particular to develop the abilities of teachers
   for using technology in classrooms. To achieve the objective of the
   study, the researchers develop a questionnaire and apply it to
   fourth-year college students, University of Baghdad, to give evidence
   and to prove the effectiveness of technology in the academic field. The
   paper examines classes where computers can be employed, and also shows
   the challenges that face teachers and educators concerning this
   application. The researchers conclude that YouTube is an essential tool
   in classrooms as it attracts the attention of students and develops
   their mentality and creativity. It also helps cover the materials
   comprehensively, especially language. YouTube brings the fun element
   into classes, which thereby meet the interests of students. Such
   findings have a significant impact on the learning process as the
   students will find the educational environment more encouraging and
   exciting. Besides, they find the material presented worth studying, and
   this way, they would appreciate the efforts exerted in explaining the
   information. The research intends to be of value to teachers for the use
   of technology and for students to have a better comprehension of the
   materials presented.},

Title = {Stimulating Intrinsic Motivation in Millennial Students: A New

Journal = {ANATOMICAL SCIENCES EDUCATION},

Volume = {13},
Number = {2},

Abstract = {There has been a fundamental change in health care pedagogy to address
   the demands and challenges posed by the present generation of millennial
   students. There is also a growing recognition of the role of intrinsic
   motivation as a catalyst in a positive learning experience. The term
   intrinsic motivation refers to energizing behavior that comes from
   within an individual and develops due to an inherent interest in the
   activity at hand. However, stimulating intrinsic motivation in the
   present generation of millennial health care students is a daunting
   task, considering their diverse and disparate nature. In addition, the
   inherent generational differences between educators and students, and an
   increasing emphasis on technological tools have resulted in a dichotomy
   in the educational environment leading to the development of a greater
   incidence of burnouts among students. Hence, numerous innovative
   techniques have been introduced in health care education to enhance the
   levels of intrinsic motivation in these students. Unfortunately, most of
   these approaches have only been moderately successful due to their
   limited ability to address the unique educational expectations of
   millennial students. The cumulative evidence suggests that specific
   approaches to stimulate intrinsic motivation should aim at nurturing the
   learning efforts of students, bridging the generational barriers between
   educators and students, and ameliorating the stress associated with
   health care education. Hence, the specific aim of this narrative review
   is to suggest empirically proven curricular strategies and institutional
   reforms to enhance intrinsic motivation in health care students
   belonging to the Millennial Generation.},

Abstract = {BackgroundThere is global need for evidence-based methodologies to
   effectively deliver transfusion training. This research critically
   assesses both efficacy and the practicalities of introducing team-based
   learning (TBL) to deliver transfusion medicine education to UK
   postgraduate doctors (residency equivalence).Study Design and MethodsOne
   TBL orientation session and three transfusion medicine sessions, mapped
   to the 2012 Foundation Programme curriculum, were designed adhering to
   TBL principles. These were delivered by one tutor during `compulsory'
   (except rota commitments and leave) educational sessions. Team
   continuity plus trainee reaction, knowledge acquisition and behaviour
   were evaluated.ResultsForty-eight doctors received a mean 2.5 TBL
   sessions. Five teams were developed with average team membership of 5.85
   doctors per session. Overall team continuity (total team members
   attending/potential team members x 100) was 65\% over the four sessions.
   Qualitative and quantitative trainee reaction to TBL was positive.
   Objective knowledge acquisition showed improved team knowledge over
   individual knowledge. Mean team readiness assurance testing (RAT) score
   exceeded maximum individual RAT score in 90\% of cases. Subjective
   knowledge acquisition significantly improved, although confidence
   concerning prescribing declined. The reported time spent preparing for
   sessions correlated with enjoyment, subjective knowledge gain and
   clinical confidence. Preparation time was reported as `adequate' or
   `excellent' in 86\% of anonymous feedback.ConclusionTBL is an enjoyable
   and effective approach to deliver transfusion education to doctors,
   particularly when preparation is adequate. Team continuity is poor
   despite `compulsory' education sessions. This must be considered when
   designing and delivering TBL sessions in the UK postgraduate medical
   setting.},

Abstract = {The coronavirus pandemic has had a high impact worldwide. The health
   crisis has not only had an impact on people's own health and on health
   systems, but has also affected other areas. In the educational context,
   the lockdown measures implemented by different governments have
   challenged the learning ecosystem. In the case of higher education in
   Spain, with a strong attendance factor in most public universities,
   face-to-face classes were interrupted after a month in the second term,
   ending the academic year in the online mode. This change has meant a
   great effort on the teachers' side to transform the face-to-face
   teaching into the online approach, which in many cases has meant quite a
   comprehensive new design of the subject, changing the evaluation process
   and the methodologies used. This work presents a success case of online
   assessment developed in the Software Engineering I subject of the Degree
   in Computer Engineering at the University of Salamanca. The objective is
   to show how the previous use of active methodologies and the integration
   of educational technologies in classroom-based teaching facilitates the
   transformation of assessment to an online or blended approach while
   maintaining a high degree of student involvement and satisfaction. After
   presenting a comparison between the face-to-face approach and the
   adaptation to the online approach, an analysis is made of the learning
   results and student satisfaction concerning previous academic years. The
   results show that the change of approach has not reduced the
   satisfaction results obtained in previous courses. In terms of learning
   outcomes, there is an overall increase in the grades obtained by
   students in all assessment items.},

Abstract = {The article assesses the impact of COVID-19 pandemic on the Indonesian
   economy and the influence that repercussions from the pandemic have had
   on the country's long-term development goals and objectives. The article
   used backcasting approach to link expected development objectives and
   targets with current state of social and economic conditions. Results
   demonstrated a gap between long-term and current economic performance,
   attributable largely to the impact of COVID-19 pandemic on the economy
   and society. A drastic decline in aggregate demand due to contraction in
   household and corporate expenditure, investment, and exports sparked a
   surge in open unemployment and underemployment. While swift and
   wide-ranging government response helped to attenuate the impact of the
   crisis on the economy and vulnerable sections of society, COVID-19
   pandemic impact compounded existing fundamental problems facing the
   Indonesian economy including de-industrialization, wide urban-rural,
   East-West, inter-regional digital divide; unemployment and
   underemployment; weak human resource development; low participation in
   global value chains; and low education effectiveness. Policy
   recommendations to nudge the economy and society back to its long-term
   development trajectory include initiatives to enhance emergency response
   program effectiveness and tackling structural problems. The initiatives
   include strengthening and widening the coverage of government programs
   that support business and society in education, labor and employment,
   and SME and trade. The thrust of the pathways stresses the need for
   accelerating the implementation of the national information highway and
   the ASEAN connectivity initiative. Achieving will support efforts to
   mainstream the adoption and deployment of digitalization in the economy,
   government, and transboundary trade.},

Title = {A Framework of Implementing Strategies for Active Student Engagement in
   Remote/Online Teaching and Learning during the COVID-19 Pandemic},
Journal = {EDUCATION SCIENCES},
Year = {2021},

Month = {SEP},
Abstract = {The COVID-19 pandemic has caused a drastic shift of face-to-face
   teaching and learning to remote/online teaching and learning at all
   levels of education worldwide. Active student engagement is always a
   challenging task for educators regardless of the teaching modalities.
   The degree of challenge for active student engagement increases
   significantly in remote/online teaching and learning. This paper
   presents a framework that implements activities/strategies to ensure
   active student engagement in remote/online teaching and learning during
   this COVID-19 pandemic. The structure of the developed framework
   combines the balanced use of adjusted teaching pedagogy, educational
   technologies, and an e-learning management system. Teaching pedagogy
   involves various active learning techniques, synchronous teaching,
   asynchronous teaching, and segmentation. The educational technologies,
   such as Google Meet, Jamboard, Google Chat, Breakout room, Mentimeter,
   Moodle, electronic writing devices, etc., enable the developed framework
   for active student engagement. An e-learning management system, Moodle,
   is used for course management purposes. Over the last three semesters
   (Fall 2020, Spring 2021, and Summer 2021), the framework is tested for
   three different engineering courses. A questionnaire draws out student
   perception on the developed framework in terms of active student
   engagement that ensures student-student interactions, student-instructor
   interactions, social presence, reinforces learning and deepens
   understanding of the materials in remote teaching. The feedback also
   indicates that combining the utilized technologies, synchronous
   teaching, and active learning activities in the developed framework is
   effective for interactive learning; hence a practical approach for
   active student engagement in remote/online teaching and learning. The
   article focuses on contributing to present research and infusing future
   research direction about technology-enhanced active student engagement
   in Engineering Education.},

Abstract = {Purpose - The first indication that traditional lecture-style teaching
   is not very effective was provided by Dr Donald Bligh in the 1980s and
   1990s. As empirical evidence about this fact has continued to
   accumulate, science, technology, engineering, and math (STEM) education
   in the USA has undergone a significant change in emphasis away from
   lecture-based approaches in favor of systems emphasizing more
   interactive learning. The paper aims to discuss this issue.
   Design/methodology/approach - A wide range of experimental research has
   employed the principles of scientific teaching to investigate the
   efficacy of an ever widening range of pedagogical methods. For STEM
   education, the most successful of these has been active learning.
   Findings - At its core, active learning is a redesign of in-class
   activities to maximize interactivity and feedback through facilitated
   problem-solving environments. Although the efficacies of both scientific
   teaching and active learning have been verified in a wide range of
   empirical works, the dissemination of these platforms, in general,
   teaching has been slow, even in the USA.
   Research limitations/implications - The first significant impediment has
   been an overall lack of awareness coupled with general skepticism about
   alternative learning methods.
   Practical implications - This paper first reviews the education
   literature behind scientific teaching and active learning before
   reviewing some of the challenges to their implementation on an
   institutional level.
   Social implications - These challenges and known solutions are then
   applied to the European and East Asian contexts to examine why
   scientific teaching and active learning remain predominantly an American
   phenomenon.
   Originality/value - For East Asian countries, the authors offer a
   commentary on how certain aspects of Confucian classroom culture may
   interact negatively with efforts to install scientific teaching and
   active learning systems.},

Abstract = {Oil and water: a common expression describing two things that do not
   combine well. In this paper I will discuss some of the wins and losses;
   successes and failures in my efforts to explore the contested territory
   between Human Science, abductive thinking and Natural Science, logical
   preconceptions within a Danish postgraduate engineering stream. This
   course was designed to help young engineers to step outside their normal
   positivist system of thinking and to explore, embrace or at least
   suspend judgement on a form of emotional/meta-physical logic. Students
   were introduced to practical (logical) methods for developing deeper
   insight into specific human experiences and to apply this genuinely
   human-centred perspective to their `engineered' solutions.
   In the engineering world, there are various ways in which oil and water
   are known to combine if only temporarily. One method of combining them
   however `unstably' is by shaking them vigorously i.e., applying energy
   to take them out of their normal stable state into one that is different
   for a time and where their best qualities can be realized. i.e., oil and
   vinegar dressing. This is one aspect of my approach in this instance; to
   shake young engineers out of their comfort zones and to explore an
   unfamiliar topography, one that was both without and within themselves.
   Alternatively, emulsifiers or surfactants are known to assist in the
   merging of two `opposing' elements. In the position presented in this
   paper, the emulsifier used, was a mixture of
   philosophical/theoretical/practical epistemological lenses through which
   each student's experiential knowledge was filtered. My goal being to
   help students to come to a deeper understanding and appreciation of the
   people for whom they proposed to design `solutions'. The entire
   pedagogical process was intended to disrupt their preconceptions in such
   a way as to help them see any situation more clearly; a process of
   in-sight based engineering.},

Title = {A deeper understanding of student preferences for in-class video use: a
   segmentation analyses of needs, group differences and preference
   clusters},
Journal = {EDUCATION AND TRAINING},
Abstract = {Purpose This study analyzed segment differences of student preference
   for video use in lecture classes and university use of video lecture
   classes. The authors then conducted novel gap analyses to identify gaps
   between student segments' preferences for videos versus their level of
   exposure to in-class videos. Multivariate analysis of variance (MANOVA)
   was used to identify significant factors that explain the gaps.
   Design/methodology/approach Segment differences of student preference
   for video use in lecture classes and university use of video lecture
   classes were analyzed. Novel gap analyses were then conducted to
   identify gaps between student segments' preferences for videos versus
   their level of exposure to in-class videos. MANOVA was used to identify
   significant factors that explain the gaps. Findings Gap analysis of
   video preference relative to video exposure showed a bimodal
   distribution, with an approximately even split between students with an
   overall deficit (44.5\%) and surplus (47\%) of in-class videos. Deficit
   means students preferred to see more videos than what the lecturer
   showed them. Surplus means the lecturer showed students more videos than
   they preferred to see. Further analyses break down the deficits and
   surpluses based on the type of videos shown. Practical implications
   Results are useful as an effective diagnostic tool for education
   managers because they are not at the individual student level but rather
   by course level. One implication for educational managers is that a
   one-size-fits-all approach for all courses will benefit some students
   and annoy others. Originality/value This paper extends Alpert and
   Hodkinson's (2019) findings by identifying preference clusters and
   performing segmentation analyses based on finer-grained disaggregated
   data analysis.},

Title = {Students' perceptions of a blended learning experience in dental

Abstract = {Introduction: ``Flipped{''} instructional sequencing is a new
   instructional method where online instruction precedes the group
   meeting, allowing for more sophisticated learning through discussion and
   critical thinking during the in-person class session; a novel approach
   studied in this research.
   Purpose: The purpose of this study was to document dental students'
   perceptions of flipped-based blended learning and to apply a new method
   of displaying their perceptions based on Likert-scale data analysis
   using a network diagramming method known as an item correlation network
   diagram (ICND). In addition, this article aimed to encourage
   institutions or course directors to consider self-regulated learning and
   social constructivism as a theoretical framework when blended learning
   is incorporated in dental curricula.
   Materials and Methods: Twenty (second year) dental students at a
   Northeastern Regional Dental School in the United States participated in
   this study. A Likert scale was administered before and after the
   learning experience to obtain evidence of their perceptions of its
   quality and educational merits. Item correlation network diagrams, based
   on the intercorrelations amongst the responses to the Likert-scale
   items, were constructed to display students' changes in perceptions
   before and after the learning experience.
   Results: Students reported positive perceptions of the blended learning,
   and the ICND analysis of their responses before and after the learning
   experience provided insights into their social (group-based) cognition
   about the learning experience. The ICNDs are considered evidence of
   social or group-based cognition, because they are constructed from
   evidence obtained using intercorrelations of the total group responses
   to the Likert-scale items.
   Conclusions: The students positively received blended learning in dental
   education, and the ICND analyses demonstrated marked changes in their
   social cognition of the learning experience based on the pre-and
   post-Likert survey data. Self-regulated learning and social
   constructivism are encouraged as useful theoretical frameworks for a
   blended learning approach.},

Abstract = {The subject of anatomy, commonly taught with applied clinical focus on
   medical programmes, is frequently brought to life alongside art, imagery
   and visualization. Yet, despite being continually hailed as the
   cornerstone of medicine, the cyclic revalidation of its curricula has
   often found its educators in the unenviable position of maintaining
   knowledge standards in the face of reduced contact time. However, the
   gravity of such challenges has created an opportunity for creative and
   innovative solutions to these problems. The ease by which educational
   technology can now be used by non-experts is constantly increasing and
   the use of technology enhanced learning has now become universal within
   Higher Education. Many anatomical science educators have turned to
   building bespoke interactive and engaging online supplementary material
   which can be blended with face to face delivery as a way to circumvent
   the time pressure issues. Today's students appear to have a growing
   preference for visualising moving images and audio explanations as
   opposed to older traditional static resources, underpinned by vast pages
   of unattractive dense text and pictures. One such technique being used
   to provide flexible and student-centred learning is screencast videos.
   These digital recordings of screen captured drawings, with accompanying
   narration are overwhelmingly popular with students and on the
   ascendance. However, as new tools emerge, it becomes increasingly
   important to determine their impact on both the student experience and
   knowledge gain. It is also valuable for educators to share their
   classroom experiences or instructional techniques to optimise their use
   for learning. This chapter explores the rise of this application in
   anatomy education and discusses the evidence available investigating
   student engagement and learning outcomes in the context of
   well-established learning theories.},

Abstract = {Flipped learning is necessary for modern education but quite difficult
   to implement. In pedagogical science, the question remains to what
   extent the practical work of the teacher in combination with the
   technologies of flipped learning will improve the quality of higher
   education. The aim of this article is to study the effectiveness and
   feasibility of using flipped learning technologies, assessing their
   perception by students (advantages and problems), identified an
   algorithm for introducing flipped learning technology in higher
   education institutions. Research methods. The main method is an
   experiment. An evaluation of the effectiveness of the study was
   conducted using a questionnaire and observation method. Statistical
   methods were used to evaluate the results of the experiment. The
   research hypothesis is that flipped learning allows the teacher to spend
   more time on an individual approach, to understand the real needs of
   students, and provide effective feedback, thereby improving the quality
   of learning and motivation of students, especially while studying
   complex material. The results of the study are to prove the
   effectiveness of the technology of flipped education in the study of
   complex disciplines, courses, topics. The use of flipped learning
   strategies improves the self-regulation of the educational process,
   group work skills, improves students' ability to learn, overcome
   difficulties. The technology of flipped learning in the presence of
   modern technical means and constant work on improving the level of
   digital literacy is an effective means for students to master complex
   topics and problematic issues that require additional consideration and
   discussion. The perspective of further research is the consideration of
   integrated approaches to the application of flipped learning
   technologies to the principles of STEAM-education, multilingual and
   multicultural programs, etc. It is also worth continuing to develop a
   set of methods aimed at enhancing the student's learning activities, the
   formation of group work skills, direct participation in creating the
   foundations of higher education.},

Title = {Effectiveness of blended learning in pharmacy education: A systematic
   review and meta-analysis},
Journal = {PLOS ONE},

Abstract = {Background \& objective
   Though blended learning (BL), is widely adopted in higher education,
   evaluating effectiveness of BL is difficult because the components of BL
   can be extremely heterogeneous. Purpose of this study was to evaluate
   the effectiveness of BL in improving knowledge and skill in pharmacy
   education.
   Methods
   PubMed/MEDLINE, Scopus and the Cochrane Library were searched to
   identify published literature. The retrieved studies from databases were
   screened for its title and abstracts followed by the full-text in
   accordance with the pre-defined inclusion and exclusion criteria.
   Methodological quality was appraised by modified Ottawa scale. Random
   effect model used for statistical modelling.
   Key findings
   A total of 26 studies were included for systematic review. Out of which
   20 studies with 4525 participants for meta-analysis which employed
   traditional teaching in control group. Results showed a statistically
   significant positive effect size on knowledge (standardized mean
   difference {[}SMD]: 1.35, 95\% confidence interval {[}CI]: 0.91 to 1.78,
   p<0.00001) and skill (SMD: 0.68; 95\% CI: 0.19 to 1.16; p = 0.006) using
   a random effect model. Subgroup analysis of cohort studies showed,
   studies from developed countries had a larger effect size (SMD: 1.54,
   95\% CI: 1.01 to 2.06), than studies from developing countries(SMD:
   0.44, 95\% CI: 0.23 to 0.65, studies with MCQ pattern as outcome
   assessment had larger effect size (SMD: 2.81, 95\% CI: 1.76 to 3.85)
   than non-MCQs (SMD 0.53, 95\% CI 0.33 to 0.74), and BL with case studies
   (SMD 2.72, 95\% CI 1.86-3.59) showed better effect size than
   non-case-based studies (SMD: 0.22, CI: 0.02 to 0.41).
   Conclusion
   BL is associated with better academic performance and achievement than
   didactic teaching in pharmacy education.},

Abstract = {Purpose: To compare the traditional lecture to a hybrid interactive and
   didactic teaching format with regards to radiology resident short- and
   long-term retention, as well as attention.
   Materials and Methods: The tested hybrid format consists of a 30-minute
   didactic lecture followed by 30 minutes of interactive cases based on
   material from the lecture portion. Faculty members were randomly
   selected to give a 60-minute lecture or a hybrid presentation. To assess
   short- and long-term retention, a test developed from the presenter's
   slides was sent to all residents approximately 15 minutes after each
   presentation, and again approximately 3 months later. The presenters
   were blinded to the survey questions. Attention was assessed by
   comparing the proportion of questions answered correctly from each
   quarter of the presentation. Equality in difficulty of questions was
   validated across teaching methods.
   Results: For 6 hybrid presentations, 106 and 60 retention tests were
   submitted, answering 848 and 480 short- and long-term survey questions,
   respectively. For 6 lectures, 91 and 55 retention tests were submitted,
   answering 728 and 440 short- and long-term survey questions,
   respectively. Short-term retention was 75.7\% (640/848) for hybrid
   presentations, versus 63.2\% (460/728) for lectures (p < 0.0001).
   Long-term retention was 59.4\% (285/480) for hybrid presentations,
   versus 49.3\% (217/440) for lectures (p = 0.002). Regarding attention,
   61.6\% (554/600) of questions from the first 3 quarters of traditional
   lectures were answered correctly versus 49.3\% (148/ 300) of final
   quarter questions (p = 0.0003). No significant drop-off was noted for
   hybrid presentations.
   Conclusion: A hybrid interactive and didactic teaching format for
   radiology residents demonstrates better short-term retention, long-term
   retention, and attention when compared to traditional lectures. (C) 2019

Title = {THE EFFICIENCY OF MOOCS IMPLEMENTATION IN TEACHING ENGLISH FOR
   PROFESSIONAL PURPOSES},
Journal = {INFORMATION TECHNOLOGIES AND LEARNING TOOLS},
Year = {2018},
Volume = {66},
Number = {4},
Pages = {186-196},
Abstract = {The article considers the way of integrating Massive Open Online Courses
   (MOOCs) into the educational process and determining their role in
   students' motivation to learn a foreign language for professional
   purposes. The goal of the research is studying the efficiency of
   implementation of MOOCs as part of students' independent work while
   learning a foreign language for professional purposes at the university.
   Considering the increasing need for education around the world, the role
   of MOOCs will become more important than ever before. Consequently,
   engaging students whose major is Information Technology in learning the
   integrating course could enhance their skill and knowledge of
   programming. The integration of MOOCs in the process of learning English
   for professional purposes will help to personalize learning environments
   and prepare future professionals. Research shows that the successful
   implementation of MOOCs can bring new opportunities to learners, such as
   increasing English proficiency level, developing critical thinking,
   decision-making, problem-solving and time management. We consider the
   scientific problem connected with the efficiency of using Internet
   resources and MOOCs, ways of using interactive online technologies in
   the traditional educational process, potential and identified new
   opportunities offered by e-learning. Our observations are also related
   to the problem of integrating MOOCs into the curriculum; adapting them
   to the thematic modules and different subjects. Research shows that
   successful integration of MOOCs in the process of learning a foreign
   language for professional purposes depends on a number of factors. Each
   stage of our research has been carefully considered in the article. This
   study shows the efficiency of MOOCs as additional resources in studying
   English for professional purposes and describes the use of information
   and communication technology of distance learning in the traditional
   educational process. In this article, we describe how this idea is being
   realized and can be adopted by universities willing to use benefits of
   MOOCs in teaching English for professional purposes.},

Title = {Investigating the impact of a flipped programming course using the
   DT-CDIO approach},
Journal = {COMPUTERS \& EDUCATION},
Year = {2021},
Volume = {173},
Month = {NOV},
Abstract = {Currently, flipped learning requires a framework that will give novices
   and students the ability to face the complex problems encountered in
   programming courses. It is necessary to design a design thinking
   learning framework that addresses independent learning and specific
   processes that will improve students' 21st-century skills. The existing
   literature has not implemented flipped programming courses from a design
   thinking perspective (Cook \& Bush, 2018), which would thus be an
   innovative approach to designing teaching methods and investigating the
   effects of this framework. The purpose of this study was to develop
   analyze, observe, reflect, conceive, design, implement, and operate
   (Crawley et al., 2007) a DT-CDIO model and to investigate the
   relationship of the flow experience to computational thinking and
   cognitive load in order to understand the impact of the flow experience
   on a flipped programming course. The participants in this study
   comprised 40 pre-service education students (Male = 17; Female = 23).
   The partial least squares (PLS) method was used for the data analysis to
   test the model. This study was intended to obtain and evaluate
   significant differences between the students' flow experience and their
   computational thinking ability and cognitive load. The results indicated
   that the DT-CDIO pedagogy filled a long-standing gap related to a lack
   of reflective pedagogy and design thinking problems. The flow experience
   negatively impacted creativity and problem solving ability. Meanwhile,
   intrinsic cognitive load negatively impacted the flow experience.
   Germane cognitive load positively impacted the flow experience. In
   particular, the flow experience is a crucial factor that can be used to
   predict various computational thinking skills in a programming
   curriculum. More importantly, this study provides important insights
   into the implications of the DT-CDIO approach and other related factors.},

Abstract = {The emergence of open online courses and flipped classrooms has brought
   new opportunities to unbundle the traditional university. This study
   aimed to investigate a thermal physics classroom integrated with an open
   online learning mode to afford various learning strategies for students
   in Taiwan. Moreover, we examined students' preferred learning modes by
   adopting a quasi-experimental design with questionnaires, pre-test and
   post-test scores, self-reported journals and interviews. A total of 89
   students participated in the study. The instructor allowed all students
   enrolled in the class to choose their own preferred learning modes. All
   students had full access to all course materials in both open online
   course and traditional face-to-face learning contexts throughout the
   whole semester. We examined the learners' academic performance in each
   learning mode and surveyed their perceptions of the course. The findings
   of this study indicate that information technology can transform
   teaching and learning in a thermal physics classroom and challenge the
   instructor to tailor the course to meet students' diverse needs.
   Significantly, students adopted five learning modes, consisting of
   face-to-face, web facilitated, alternative blended, online learning and
   flipped learning. This study provides a valuable reference on how
   traditional on-campus higher education institutions could be unbundled
   to create student-centred learning approaches. Implications for practice
   or policy: center dot Educators could design a flexible delivery model,
   allowing students to choose five learning modes, consisting of
   face-to-face, web facilitated, alternative blended, online learning and
   flipped learning in terms of their learning style and time management.
   center dot For students with sufficient background knowledge, the
   flipped learning mode provides the best learning performance. center dot
   This study could provide administrators, educators and instructors with
   insights and new approaches in science, technology, engineering and
   mathematics education and improvements in their course policies.},

Title = {Development of a tailor-made surgical online learning platform, ensuring
   surgical education in times of the COVID19 pandemic},

Abstract = {Background During the worldwide COVID-19 pandemic, the quality of
   surgical education experiences sudden major restrictions. Students'
   presence in the operating theater and on wards is reduced to a bare
   minimum and face-to-face teaching is diminished. Aim of this study was
   therefore to evaluate alternative but feasible educational concepts,
   such as an online-only-platform for undergraduates. Objective A new
   online platform for undergraduate surgical education was implemented. A
   virtual curriculum for online-only education was designed. Methods
   A video-based online platform was designed. Following this, a cohort of
   medical students participating in a (voluntary) surgical course was
   randomized into a test and control group. Prior to conducting a written
   exam, students in the test group prepared using the video platform.
   Students in the control group prepared with standard surgical text
   books. Results of the exam were used to compare educational means.
   Results Students in the test group preparing through the video-based
   online platform reached significantly higher scores in the written exams
   (p = 0.0001) than students of the control group. A trend towards reduced
   preparation time that did not reach statistical significance was
   detectable in the test group (p = 0.090). Scores of ``perceived
   workload{''} and ``desire to become a surgeon{''} offered no differences
   between the groups. (p = 0.474 and 1.000). Conclusions An online-only,
   virtual curriculum proved feasible for surgical education in
   undergraduates. While blended learning concepts were applied in both
   groups, only the test group had access to case-based videos of surgical
   procedures and scored significantly better in the written exams. Thus,
   video-based virtual education offers a realistic alternative to
   face-to-face teaching or conventional text books in times of restricted
   access to the operating theatre.},

Title = {Impact of educational games on academic outcomes of students in the
   Degree in Nursing},
Journal = {PLOS ONE},
Year = {2019},
Volume = {14},
Number = {7},
Month = {JUL 29},
Abstract = {Objective
   The aim of using the game-based tool Kahoot! was to evaluate and
   reinforce the contents taught in the subject of Management and
   Administration of Nursing, Ethics and Health Legislation Services
   included in the Degree in Nursing, during the 2016-2017 academic year.
   Methods
   A prospective quasi-experimental study was carried out on a sample of
   116 students. 10 multiple-choice questions were designed, with only one
   possible correct answer and a 20-second-limited response time for each
   of the questions. Four of these questions previously answered in the
   classroom using this game were chosen (20\% of the exam). Each one of
   them corresponded to one unit of the topics taught in the subject.
   In order to participate in the educational game, students needed their
   smartphones or electronic devices. After completing the game, the
   students' satisfaction level derived from its use was assessed.
   Results
   The correct answer rate in the educational game was greater than 50\%
   for all questions except for one, in which the rate was 28.8\% (P<0.05).
   Response time as related to score presented statistically significant
   differences, and higher scores for those questions with lower response
   time (P<0.001).
   The questions included in the final test which had been previously
   answered using Kahoot! showed a significantly higher difficulty index
   than the rest of the final exam questions (P<0.05). Question 3 was the
   easiest, while being the one in which the highest-scoring students
   obtained more wrong answers.
   For the students this tool was easy to use (89.6\%) and they positively
   valued the content acquisition and comprehension, as well as the
   teacher-student interaction (P<0.05).
   Conclusion
   The implementation of educational games which consider response time and
   correct answers favors competitiveness and motivates students to
   actively participate in their learning process.},

Title = {The Efficiency of Online ``Inked{''} Videos Versus Recorded PowerPoint
   Lectures on Teaching Pathophysiology to Medical Students in
   Pre-Clerkship Years: A Pilot Study},
Journal = {JOURNAL OF MEDICAL EDUCATION AND CURRICULAR DEVELOPMENT},
Year = {2020},
Volume = {7},
Month = {JAN},
Abstract = {Background: As online learning develops an increasingly important role
   in medical education, new online teaching modalities are arising all the
   time. One such teaching modality that is gaining popularity among
   medical students is the ``inked{''} video, a type of animated video that
   utilizes a virtual blackboard. Student reviews suggest that the dynamic
   style of the inked video allows it to teach more efficiently than
   traditional teaching modalities, but currently there is no quantitative
   evidence to support or guide the use of this teaching modality.
   Hypothesis: When compared to the traditional recorded PowerPoint
   lecture, online inked videos teach the same pathophysiology concepts to
   pre-clerkship medical students in a shorter amount of time. Method: A
   randomized, crossover-design study was conducted with second-year
   medical students at the David Geffen School of Medicine at University of
   California, Los Angeles (n = 22). Students were randomized to 2 groups.
   Each group received 2 lessons on 2 different pathophysiology topics: one
   via a shorter inked video and the other via a longer recorded PowerPoint
   lecture. Two sets of dependent variables were used to test modality
   effects: immediate post-tests scores and delayed retention post-test
   scores. A perceptions survey was also administered to assess student
   preferences between the 2 teaching modalities. Results: Students
   performed similarly on immediate and delayed post-tests for the shorter
   inked videos and the longer recorded PowerPoint lectures (P > .05).
   Students reported greater engagement (P < .05) and greater satisfaction
   with learning (P < .05) with the inked videos than the recorded
   PowerPoint lectures. Conclusions: This study, although limited by its
   small-scale and single-institution design, provides preliminary evidence
   that online inked videos may be a more efficient and non-inferior
   alternative to recorded PowerPoint lectures.},

Title = {Table Quizzes as an Assessment Tool in the Gross Anatomy Laboratory},
Journal = {JOURNAL OF MEDICAL EDUCATION AND CURRICULAR DEVELOPMENT},
Year = {2020},
Volume = {7},
Month = {JUL},
Abstract = {Using cadaveric instruction in a graduate-level anatomy course is an
   expensive and time-consuming undertaking. While this is a worthwhile
   endeavor, most first-year medical students and students in the health
   fields struggle with the independent, self-directed learning approach in
   the cadaveric laboratory, and going beyond rote memorization of the
   material. As such, effective assessment tools that maximize student
   learning in the cadaveric laboratory are critical, especially if no
   lecture component is present. Dissection quality often reflects student
   attention to detail and therefore may be tied to overall performance in
   the course. The aim of this study was to investigate the relationship
   between weekly table quizzes and the overall student outcomes in a
   graduate biomedical human dissection class as well as examining the
   benefits and implications of this approach. In this course, a uniquely
   structured weekly quiz assessed dissection quality and probed student
   understanding in human anatomy. Student data compiled from 5 years of
   dissection courses were analyzed to evaluate the relationship between
   performance in the weekly assessment and on the unit examinations. The
   results showed a statistically significant relationship between the
   weekly quizzes and the student examinations at the end of each
   dissection block in 2013, 2015, 2016, and 2017. The data suggest a
   potential correlation between performance on weekly quizzes and on unit
   examinations. The unique nature of the table quizzes provides the
   students with the opportunity to practice the retrieval of their
   knowledge, feel more guided throughout their dissection, and receive
   immediate feedback on their performance. This assessment tool also
   provides a way to predict student outcomes and an opportunity for early
   intervention to help at-risk students. The analysis of this research
   study contributes to the need for more data on the usage of assessment
   tools in a graduate human dissection class.},

Abstract = {Objective The aim was to develop a new curriculum for radiology in
   medical studies, to reach a national consensus and to integrate it into
   the new national competence-based learning objectives catalog (NKLM
   2.0). In this statement of the German Radiological Society (DRG), the
   process of curriculum development is described and the new curriculum is
   presented together with suggestions for practical implementation.
   Materials and Methods The DRG has developed a new curriculum for
   radiology. This was coordinated nationally among faculty via an online
   survey and the result was incorporated into the NKLM 2.0. Furthermore,
   possibilities for the practical implementation of the competency-based
   content are shown and different teaching concepts are presented.
   Results The developed curriculum is competency-based and aims to provide
   students with important skills and abilities for their future medical
   practice. The general part of the curriculum is divided into the topics
   ``Radiation Protection{''}, ``Radiological Methods{''} and
   radiologically-relevant ``Digital Skills{''}. Furthermore, there is a
   special part on the individual organ systems and the specific diseases.
   In order to implement this in a resource-saving way, new innovative
   teaching concepts are needed that combine the advantages of face-to-face
   teaching in small groups for practical and case-based learning with
   digital teaching offers for resource-saving teaching of theoretical
   content.
   Conclusion We have created a uniform radiology curriculum for medical
   studies in Germany, coordinated it nationally and integrated it into the
   NKLM 2.0. The curriculum forms the basis of a uniform mandatory
   radiology teaching and should be the basis for the individual curriculum
   development of each faculty and strengthen the position of radiology in
   the interdisciplinary context.},

Abstract = {This article focuses on the smart approach applied in teaching two
   topics (referred to as learning contents) within English for Specific
   Purposes with regard to students' motivation types. It introduces
   results of the research conducted in this field. The research is based
   on the definition of the term smart set by Silverio-Fernandez et al.
   (2018) and the theory of motivation types created by Plaminek (2010),
   who designed the standardised Motivation Type Inventory distinguishing
   four motivation types (accurators, coordinators, directors, explorers).
   Data were collected via didactic tests; quantitative methods were
   applied to calculate the potential increase in students' knowledge as a
   difference between pre-test and post-test scores in the didactic tests.
   In total, 119 prospective teachers from the Faculty of Education and the
   Faculty of Science at Jan Evangelista Purkyne University participated in
   this research conducted via quasi-experimental ex-post-facto method for
   12 weeks. The smart approach included the exploitation of smart devices
   and technologies (applications) in faceto-face instruction and in-home
   preparation for lessons. Three main hypotheses were set to prove whether
   the smart approach to ESP instruction can be applied to learners of all
   motivation types. According to the findings, the smart approach suited
   students of all motivation types; however, coordinators' increase in
   knowledge was significantly higher compared to explorers and directors
   in one of the learning contents.
   Implications for practice of policy:
   All teachers (prospective, novice and in-service) should be trained in
   conducting smart instruction applying the latest results from psycho-
   and neuro-didactics.
   Stronger focus should be paid on developing autonomous learning within
   the learning competence with learners of all ages so that the strengths
   of smart instruction can be exploited efficiently.
   Currently, all teachers are to acquire distance (online) smart
   instruction.},

Abstract = {Objective: Rapid advancements in medicine and changing standards in
   medical education require new, efficient educational strategies. We
   investigated whether an online intervention could increase residents'
   knowledge and improve knowledge retention in mechanical ventilation when
   compared with a clinical rotation and whether the timing of intervention
   had an impact on overall knowledge gains. Design: A prospective,
   interventional crossover study conducted from October 2015 to December
   2017. Setting: Multicenter study conducted in 33 PICUs across eight
   countries. Subjects: Pediatric categorical residents rotating through
   the PICU for the first time. We allocated 483 residents into two arms
   based on rotation date to use an online intervention either before or
   after the clinical rotation. Interventions: Residents completed an
   online virtual mechanical ventilation simulator either before or after a
   1-month clinical rotation with a 2-month period between interventions.
   Measurements and Main Results: Performance on case-based,
   multiple-choice question tests before and after each intervention was
   used to quantify knowledge gains and knowledge retention. Initial
   knowledge gains in residents who completed the online intervention
   (average knowledge gain, 6.9\%; sd, 18.2) were noninferior compared with
   those who completed 1 month of a clinical rotation (average knowledge
   gain, 6.1\%; sd, 18.9; difference, 0.8\%; 95\% CI, -5.05 to 6.47; p =
   0.81). Knowledge retention was greater following completion of the
   online intervention when compared with the clinical rotation when
   controlling for time (difference, 7.6\%; 95\% CI, 0.7-14.5; p = 0.03).
   When the online intervention was sequenced before (average knowledge
   gain, 14.6\%; sd, 15.4) rather than after (average knowledge gain,
   7.0\%; sd, 19.1) the clinical rotation, residents had superior overall
   knowledge acquisition (difference, 7.6\%; 95\% CI, 2.01-12.97;p =
   0.008). Conclusions: Incorporating an interactive online educational
   intervention prior to a clinical rotation may offer a strategy to prime
   learners for the upcoming rotation, augmenting clinical learning in
   graduate medical education.},

Title = {Virtual pedagogical strategies and HESI student outcomes in response to
   COVID-19},
Journal = {NURSE EDUCATION TODAY},
Year = {2021},
Volume = {104},
Month = {SEP},
Abstract = {Background: To maintain curricular integrity in response to COVID-19,
   nurse educators are increasingly required to transition from traditional
   (face-to-face) to virtual pedagogy. Objectives: The purpose of this
   analysis was to compare the HESI scores based on a traditional pedagogy
   with the HESI scores following implementation of virtual pedagogy during
   Spring 2020. Methods: Student (n = 115; 81\% female; mean age = 25.71
   years) HESI scores were compared after each eightweek session using the
   Mann Whitney U test, permutation test and Wilcoxon rank test. Logistic
   regression was used to identify students achieving at least 850.
   Chi-square test was used to determine the relationship between pedagogy
   and students meeting 850 HESI scores. Fall 2019 Exit HESI scores were
   also compared with Spring 2020 Exit HESI scores. Results: Students from
   diverse backgrounds (53.9\% White; 27.8\% Hispanic; 10.4\% Asian; 5.2\%
   Black; 1\% Unknown) increased (p = 0.022) MHESI scores following virtual
   pedagogy in Fundamentals, although no difference was found in Maternity
   (p = 0.311), Psychiatric (p = 0.129) or Medical Surgical Nursing (p =
   0.692). Wilcoxon rank test revealed significant differences in MHESI
   scores in same cohort of students between traditional (Psychiatric) and
   virtual strategies (Medical-Surgical) (p < 0.01); and traditional
   (Medical-Surgical) and virtual (Psychiatric) strategies (p = 0.023).
   White students' MHESI scores were higher than Asian students', as
   revealed by Logistic regression with no differences based on gender.
   Spring 2020 and Fall 2019 Exit HESI scores were comparable (p = 0.499).
   Chi-square analysis revealed no relationship between pedagogy and
   achieving at least 850 on HESI (chi 2 = 0.027, p = 0.871). Conclusions:
   Based on the exit HESI scores, virtual pedagogy was as effective as
   traditional pedagogy for maintaining student competency in a community
   college associate degree nursing program. Future analyses of the
   effectiveness of virtual pedagogy in meeting curricular outcomes is
   warranted, regardless of exit degree option.},

Title = {Team-based learning (TBL): a community of practice},
Journal = {BMC MEDICAL EDUCATION},
Year = {2019},
Volume = {19},
Number = {1},
Month = {OCT 15},
Abstract = {Background Rapid changes in medical practice have a large impact on the
   demands faced by educators in preparing students for future
   participation in a multifaceted healthcare workforce. Competencies
   required by today's medical graduates encompass the ability to
   effectively collaborate, communicate and problem solve. The learning
   needs of medical students have also changed over time. Today's medical
   students are highly interconnected, enjoying teamwork and collaborative
   practice, and desire continuous, explicit feedback. They want structured
   learning activities, with clear expectations, and enjoy a sense of
   accomplishment on their achievements. The conflation of these issues has
   seen many medical schools adopt the model of Team-based learning (TBL).
   Using the conceptual framework of communities of practice, we sought to
   qualitatively explore students' and teachers' experience of TBL in Year
   1 of a graduate entry medical program. Methods Convenience sampling was
   used to select 169/350 (48\%) Year 1 students who completed three TBL
   sessions. Each TBL session was facilitated by three senior clinicians.
   Following participation in the TBLs, students were invited to attend
   focus groups, and all facilitators (n = 9) were invited to attend
   interviews. A coding framework was developed to code the entire dataset,
   using the theoretical lens of communities of practice. Results 34/169
   (20\%) of students attended focus groups. Three facilitators (3/9, 33\%)
   were interviewed. Students and facilitators felt the structure and
   organisation of TBL made students accountable for their learning and
   team contributions. The combined expertise and clinical experience of
   facilitators, with immediate feedback helped groups to work both
   independently and collaboratively. Facilitators found working with their
   peers in the TBLs to be a rewarding experience. Conclusions The
   community of practice found in the TBL classes, provided an enriching
   and rewarding learning environment that motivated students to build on
   their basic knowledge and apply what had been learnt. The interactions
   of experienced, senior clinicians as facilitators, sharing their
   expertise within a clinical context, prompted effective student
   engagement in learning and understanding. Our change in curriculum
   design and pedagogy will assist in preparing medical students for
   demands of the increasingly complex healthcare systems in which they
   will work.},

Title = {Investigating student engagement with intentional content: An
   exploratory study of instructional videos},
Journal = {INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF MANAGEMENT EDUCATION},
Year = {2021},
Volume = {19},
Number = {2},
Month = {JUL},
Abstract = {In recent years, flipped classrooms have become increasingly popular in
   higher education environments. In tandem, there is an increasing
   interest in engagement analytics and educational data mining to identify
   how students directly engage with content and resources. The Flipped
   Learning Network (FLN) defines flipped learning as a pedagogical
   approach in which direct instruction moves from the group learning space
   to the individual learning space. The resulting group space is
   transformed into a dynamic, interactive learning environment where
   instructors guide students as they apply concepts and engage creatively
   with subject matter. To engage in flipped learning effectively,
   instructors incorporate four pillars into their educational practice
   (F-L-I-P): Flexible Environment, Learning Culture, Intentional Content
   and Professional Educator.
   This study focuses primarily on one pillar of F-L-I-P i.e., Intentional
   Content, provided to maximise classroom time, to better utilise teaching
   and learning methods for a more student-centred, active learning
   experience. This exploratory study uses log-file data generated by the
   Learning Management System (LMS) to identify patterns, usage, and
   engagement of 468 undergraduate students. Firstly, the study
   investigates what intentional content students effectively engage with,
   for learning. Secondly, it investigates usage frequency and specific
   intervals, with a view to identifying critical times in the semester
   where intentional content is perceived as essential by students.
   Thirdly, the study explores how intentional content supplements other
   elements of the FLIP environment.
   Preliminary findings indicate a discernible pattern of usage, and usage
   frequency of intentional content amongst students. Engagement is ad hoc;
   and in the main the behaviour is fragmented, inconsistent, and
   disjointed-overall students are not engaging effectively and
   consistently. Additionally, the distribution of intentional content
   engagement is skewed towards the start and end of semester, emphasising
   these intervals as critical points. Of note, more consistent behaviour
   is adopted at the beginning of the module, however students become less
   engaged with all content as the term progresses. Conversely, a change in
   student behaviour is observed as the term comes to a close, whereby more
   positive patterns emerge -perhaps attributable to pending examinations.},

Title = {An effective blended online teaching and learning strategy during the
   COVID-19 pandemic},
Journal = {EDUCATION FOR CHEMICAL ENGINEERS},

Abstract = {The shift to distance teaching and learning during the COVID-19 pandemic
   brought about a real challenge for both instructors and students. To
   face these difficulties in teaching undergraduate Chemistry courses at
   the University of Santo Tomas, a blended learning strategy in the
   context of teaching and learning of Physical Chemistry 1 and Analytical
   Chemistry for Chemical Engineering students were employed. Here, we
   present an online strategy that facilitated the transition from
   traditional face-to-face learning to full online instruction. This is a
   five-component blended learning strategy referred to as Discover, Learn,
   Practice, Collaborate and Assess (DLPCA). In DLPCA, the asynchronous
   part of the teaching was achieved through broadcast of pre-recorded
   lecture videos on YouTube to allow students to study and progress with
   learning at their own pace. The synchronous part of the teaching was
   conducted using video conferencing platforms, such as Zoom or Google
   Meet. The DLPCA strategy was presented and discussed to the students
   prior to its implementation. The analysis of the teaching and learning
   experience based on three indicators (i) student?s learning experience,
   (ii) student?s academic performance and (iii) instructor observations
   showed that DLPCA had a positive impact on students and instructors. The
   identified challenges were stability of internet connection and
   instructor?s familiarity with readily available internet-based teaching
   tools, such as video conferencing software. Instructors must also find
   means to improve their interaction with students and maintain student
   interest and engagement during online classes. The survey also indicated
   that most of the students are satisfied with the DLCPA strategy. Hence,
   this strategy is considered a manageable and effective alternative that
   can be adapted to full online instruction to other undergraduate
   Chemistry lecture courses. Overall, the findings and insights in this
   study will add valuable resources for further hybrid instruction in the
   post-COVID-19 time in higher education. ? 2021 Institution of Chemical

Title = {Developing and Implementing Multioutcome Experiments in Undergraduate
   Teaching Laboratories To Promote Student Ownership of the Experience: An
   Example Multioutcome Experiment for the Oxidation of Alcohols},
Journal = {JOURNAL OF CHEMICAL EDUCATION},
Year = {2019},
Volume = {96},

Abstract = {Single-outcome experiments are used in the undergraduate instructional
   laboratory, particularly for large lectures associated with multiple
   sections of instructional laboratories, due in large part to
   efficiencies associated with chemical purchases, experiment
   preparations, and assessments. Despite the practical advantages,
   single-outcome experiments are not effective in encouraging students to
   critically analyze and interpret their acquired individual results.
   Instead, students are satisfied if their results are the same as or
   similar to all of their classmates' results, limiting the opportunity
   for engagement with the laboratory content. In contrast, multioutcome
   experiments (MOEs) require students to explore the same chemical
   reaction or transformation but obtain individual results.
   Individualization of results is accomplished by using a set of starting
   materials or reagents, one of which is assigned to each student.
   Students do not know the identity of the assigned component but may be
   given possible options for its identity. Students elucidate the identity
   of their individualized products, using modern analytical techniques
   such as gas chromatography, Fourier-transform infrared (FTIR)
   spectroscopy, and nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectroscopy, and
   deduce the unknown component of their experiment. An example MOE for the
   oxidation of alcohols is described herein. A traditional single-outcome
   experiment that utilized a common household oxidizing agent
   (hypochlorite bleach), rather than a heavy metal-containing alternative,
   was modified. For the MOE modification, one unknown secondary alcohol
   (2-pentanol, 3-pentanol, or 3-methyl-2-butanol) was oxidized using
   bleach. Each student pair was assigned one of three possible unknown
   alcohols, all of which were constitutional isomers of secondary
   alcohols. Students knew the identities of the three possible alcohols.
   Analysis of their oxidation products was accomplished using FTIR and
   benchtop H-1 NMR spectroscopies. Students interpreted their spectra and
   deduced the identity of the unknown alcohol they were assigned. This
   experiment provides a tangible framework to understand the applicability
   of the oxidation reaction and the utility of FTIR and H-1 NMR
   spectroscopies.},

Title = {Development of a Men's Health course for first-year undergraduates using
   culturally responsive teaching strategies},
Journal = {HEALTH EDUCATION},
Abstract = {Purpose A novel first-year experience course was developed using
   culturally responsive teaching strategies at an undergraduate liberal
   arts college in the southeastern USA to promote health advocacy and to
   provide students with an overview of male health. The course focuses on
   the biological, sociocultural, economic and gender influences that shape
   men's health beliefs and practices. It also emphasizes health
   disparities in the USA among Black/African American men compared to
   other racial groups and intervention strategies to improve health
   outcomes. Design/methodology/approach The lecture and laboratory
   components of the course were designed as a blended learning environment
   with a modified flipped class model. Culturally relevant strategies
   guided the course design with three focus domains: academic success,
   cultural competence and sociopolitical consciousness. A community
   engagement model and service-learning activities were also incorporated
   in the design. The authors used course grades to gauge learning and
   implemented a survey to assess students' perception of the knowledge
   gained in three realms: men's health, health sciences and physical
   sciences. Findings This report describes the course design, highlights
   the value of using culturally responsive teaching strategies and
   service-learning projects to encourage students' active learning. Course
   activity examples are discussed with student responses. The authors
   found that students' perception of their knowledge in men's health,
   health sciences and physical sciences increased and the students
   performed well in the course. Originality/value This is one of few
   biology courses in the nation that intentionally focuses on the unique
   health challenges of Black men, while empowering college students to
   develop culturally competent strategies to improve their health
   outcomes. The findings suggest that the students learned the material
   and that their perceived knowledge on men's health increased. The
   authors urge other academic institutions and healthcare providers to
   consider implementation of similar courses in an effort to enhance male
   health equity.},

Title = {Application of the inverted classroom model in the teaching module ``new
   classification of periodontal and peri-implant diseases and
   conditions{''} during the COVID-19 pandemic},

Abstract = {Background: Due to the need for patient-free dental education during the
   COVID-19 pandemic, Hannover Medical School (MHH) implemented a new
   periodontology module. Its didactic structure was based on the
   ``inverted classroom model{''} (ICM) in combination with elements of
   case-based learning. The educational objective was to increase the
   diagnostic confidence of dental students in the classification of
   periodontal patients (staging \& grading), based on 33 digitized patient
   cases. To assess the suitability of the module for future dental
   curricula, this study aimed to evaluate student satisfaction and skills
   acquisition.
   Methods: The periodontology module, which was attended by final year
   dental students of MHH (n=55, mean age: 26.5 +/- 3.9 years, male/female
   ratio: 24.1\%/75.9\%) was evaluated in a two-tiered way. Student
   satisfaction was recorded using a questionnaire. Learning success was
   assessed by comparing error rates in patient case classifications before
   (T-0) and after (T-1) participation in the periodontology module.
   Results: The study found a high level of student satisfaction with the
   ICM format and a significant reduction in error rates (T-0 error
   rate=28.3\%; MV +/- SD=3.12 +/- 1.67 vs. T-1 error rate=18.7\%; MV +/-
   SD=2.06 +/- 1.81; Delta=9.6\%). However, of the 11 diagnostic decisions
   required, only four parameters (extent, grading, percentage of bone loss
   per age, phenotype) showed significant improvements, with effect sizes
   ranging from small to medium.
   Conclusions: The ICM-based teaching concept is definitely not an
   alternative to patient-based learning. However, in regard to student
   satisfaction and learning success, it might be superior to conventional
   classroom-based lectures, especially when complex topics are covered. In
   summary, the newly developed periodontology module may be a useful
   addition to traditional dental education in future curricula, even for
   the time after the COVID-19 pandemic.},

Title = {An Online-Based Edu-Escape Room: A Comparison Study of a
   Multidimensional Domain of PSTs with Flipped Sustainability-STEM

Abstract = {The use of active and flipped methodologies has increased in recent
   years. Here, gamification uses typical elements of a game in different
   contexts, including that of education. Specifically, Escape Room games
   used as educational tools have potential for teaching-learning, and they
   can be beneficial because they can improve students' motivation and
   emotions toward learning. This is particularly valuable in science,
   technology, engineering and mathematics (STEM) courses, where the
   cognitive factor and multidimensional domain are closely connected. This
   research presents an online-based Edu-Escape Room with science and
   sustainability contents as an educative tool in a STEM course. With the
   intervention proposed, we analyze how this tool influences the
   multidimensional domain (attitudes, self-efficacy and emotions) of
   pre-service teachers (PSTs). According to attitude and self-efficacy
   analysis, it is observed that most of the items analyzed show an
   increase in self-efficacy and more positive attitudes after the
   intervention. In particular, Question 11 (Q11) indicates a significant
   difference. Concerning the results for emotion, the positive emotions
   ``joy{''}, ``satisfaction{''} and ``fun{''} are significantly increased
   after the intervention. However, the negative emotions
   ``nervousness{''}, ``frustration{''} and ``concern{''} also increase,
   partly due to the game characteristics. The proposed activity had a
   medium effect on items with significant differences except for the
   emotion ``frustration{''}, where the intervention had a large effect
   according to effect size (ES) analysis. According to the principal
   component analysis (PCA), the attitudes, self-efficacy and emotions of
   the PSTs are positively correlated, and the influence of the proposed
   activity shows a significant improvement in these variables. Finally,
   the structural equation modeling partial least squares (SEM-PLS)
   analysis showed the effects that the instruction has on the PSTs'
   emotions and also that they had a significant effect on the positive
   attitudes towards and self-efficacy in science. Therefore, there are
   multiple benefits in the multidimensional domain of PSTs of having
   implemented the proposed online-based Edu-Escape Room.},

Title = {An Approach for Scaffolding Students Peer-Learning Self-Regulation
   Strategy in the Online Component of Blended Learning},
Journal = {IEEE ACCESS},
Year = {2021},
Volume = {9},
Pages = {30721-30738},
Abstract = {The implementation of blended learning in higher educational
   institutions is increasing due to its perceived effectiveness in
   affording the benefits of both face-to-face traditional mode and the
   fully online mode of instructions. However, the leading challenge
   associated with the online component of blended learning is students'
   inability to properly self-regulate their learning activities as
   self-regulation has been an integral competence for the success in
   online environments. Research on supporting students' self-regulation in
   the online component of blended learning has been on the rise, but these
   approaches have primarily focused on designing systems and techniques to
   support students self-regulated learning and have not provided solutions
   to self-regulation strategies, more importantly online peer-learning
   self-regulation strategy. The lack of online peer learning
   self-regulation strategy has been the hallmark of the challenges in
   blended learning instruction. This study proposed an approach for
   scaffolding students peer-learning self-regulation strategy in the
   online component of blended learning. The study involves forming online
   peer-learning groups based on learning potential and affinity
   structures; leveraging the design of learning system features to
   instigate group dynamic elements for facilitating and motivating small
   group peer-learning, as well as promoting pro-social behavior by
   offering incentives for combating the inherent problems of reluctance to
   students' peer-learning participation. An experiment involving 120
   university Students shows that effective online peer-learning
   self-regulation strategy scaffold involves preparing and inspiring
   students so as to prevent social loafing and refusal to participate; and
   secondly to facilitate and fully engage students in the actual online
   peer-learning discussion. The experimental results show significant
   improvement of students' academic performance by using this approach. In
   addition, our study proposed recommendations for future research.},

Abstract = {Background \& Objective Medical schools have evolved toward
   competency-based education and active learner-centered strategies.
   Medical informatics course was introduced in 2011 in the 3rd year at the
   College of Medicine (CoM), King Saud University (KSU), to enhance future
   medical graduates with technological and information competencies.
   Modified team-based learning and blended learning were emphasized using
   face-to-face lectures, various e-learning technologies, workshop and
   seminars. The current study's main objective was to assess students'
   perceptions towards blended and modified team-based learning at the CoM
   in KSU. Methods A survey was distributed to medical students in three
   consecutive years: 2017-2019. The survey contains items regarding
   student perception of various types of blended learning techniques
   applied in the course. The survey was administered using i-Clicker; an
   interactive device that enables students to answer survey questions.
   Descriptive statistics were used to examine the perception of students
   on these blended learning dimensions investigated. Results Seven-hundred
   and one student responded to the questionnaire (male; 69.5\%, female
   30.5\%). Out of which, 59.1\% of students found team interactions
   positively supported discussions and asked questions freely, and 48.1\%
   expressed that working in groups facilitated their learning process.
   However, 56.0\% of students chose face-to-face lectures as the most
   preferred class activities followed by discussion 23.8\%. More than 78\%
   of participants agree that online quizzes are good experience and
   enjoyable. Grade center where students can check for marks and
   attendance also received high perception (66.3\%). Conclusion
   Introducing modified team-based and blended-learning are considered
   challenging, and therefore, investigating their perceptions can provide
   useful insights into how these methods could be used more effectively.
   The blended-learning technique is highly essential in teaching medical
   informatics to overcome challenges faced due to a large number of
   students and the need for various exposures to reach the course's
   learning goals. Moreover, it is noticed that students were engaged in
   face-to-face and online activities, furthermore, modified team-based
   learning reported facilitating learning and asking questions without
   embarrassment.},

   Placement Is Improved Using a Computer-Enhanced Visual Learning Program:

Abstract = {BACKGROUND: Physician educators must balance the need for resident
   procedural education with clinical time pressures as well as patient
   safety and comfort. Alternative educational strategies, including
   e-learning tools, may be beneficial to orient novice learners to new
   procedures and speed proficiency. We created an e-learning tool
   (computer-enhanced visual learning {[}CEVL] neuraxial) to enhance
   trainee proficiency in combined spinal-epidural catheter placement in
   obstetric patients and performed a randomized controlled 2-center trial
   to test the hypothesis that use of the tool improved the initial
   procedure performed by the anesthesiology residents.
   METHODS: Anesthesiology residents completing their first obstetric
   anesthesiology rotation were randomized to receive online access to the
   neuraxial module (CEVL group) or no access (control) 2 weeks before the
   rotation. On the first day of the rotation, residents completed a
   neuraxial procedure self-confidence scale and an open-ended medical
   knowledge test. Blinded raters observed residents performing combined
   spinal-epidural catheter techniques in laboring parturients using a
   procedural checklist (0-49 pts); the time required to perform the
   procedure was recorded. The primary outcome was the duration of the
   procedure.
   RESULTS: The CEVL group had significantly shorter mean (+/- standard
   deviation) procedure time compared to the control group 22.5 +/- 4.9 vs
   39.5 +/- 7.1 minutes (P < .001) and had higher scores on the overall
   performance checklist 36.4 +/- 6.6 vs 28.8 +/- 7.1 (P = .012). The
   intervention group also had higher scores on the open-ended medical
   knowledge test (27.83 +/- 3.07 vs 22.25 +/- 4.67; P = .002), but
   self-confidence scores were not different between groups (P = .64).
   CONCLUSIONS: CEVL neuraxial is a novel prerotation teaching tool that
   may enhance the traditional initial teaching of combined spinal-epidural
   procedures in obstetric anesthesiology. Future research should examine
   whether the use of web-based learning tools impacts long-term provider
   performance or patient outcomes.},

Title = {A comparison of three interactive examination designs in active learning
   classrooms for nursing students},

Abstract = {Background Despite the advantages of using active learning strategies in
   nursing education, researchers have rarely investigated how such
   pedagogic approaches can be used to assess students or how interactive
   examinations can be modified depending on circumstances of practice
   (e.g., in online education). Aims The aim was to compare three
   interactive examination designs, all based on active learning pedagogy,
   in terms of nursing students' engagement and preparedness, their
   learning achievement, and instructional aspects. Methods A comparative
   research design was used including final-year undergraduate nursing
   students. All students were enrolled in a quality improvement course at
   a metropolitan university in Sweden. In this comparative study to
   evaluate three course layouts, participants (Cohort 1, n = 89; Cohort 2,
   n = 97; Cohort 3, n = 60) completed different examinations assessing the
   same course content and learning objectives, after which they evaluated
   the examinations on a questionnaire in numerical and free-text
   responses. Chi-squared tests were conducted to compare background
   variables between the cohorts and Kruskal-Wallis H tests to assess
   numerical differences in experiences between cohorts. Following the
   guidelines of the Good Reporting of a Mixed Methods Study (GRAMMS), a
   sequential mixed-methods analysis was performed on the quantitative
   findings, and the qualitative findings were used complementary to
   support the interpretation of the quantitative results. Results The 246
   students who completed the questionnaire generally appreciated the
   interactive examination in active learning classrooms. Among significant
   differences in the results, Cohort 2 (e.g., conducted the examination on
   campus) scored highest for overall positive experience and engagement,
   whereas Cohort 3 (e.g., conducted the examination online) scored the
   lowest. Students in Cohort 3 generally commended the online
   examination's chat function available for use during the examination.
   Conclusions Interactive examinations for nursing students succeed when
   they are campus-based, focus on student preparation, and provide the
   necessary time to be completed.},

Title = {Implementation of Innovative Educational Technologies in Teaching of
   Anatomy and Basic Medical Sciences During the COVID-19 Pandemic in a
   Developing Country: The COVID-19 Silver Lining?},
Journal = {ADVANCES IN MEDICAL EDUCATION AND PRACTICE},
Year = {2021},

Pages = {619-625},
Abstract = {This article is a descriptive and reflective piece on the strategic
   adaptations that facilitated and enabled the teaching of anatomy and
   related basic medical sciences to medical students in an African medical
   school that never shut down during the COVID-19 induced lockdown of the
   year 2020. The article considers the roles of educational technology,
   innovations, media and how these were used to achieve learning
   objectives with optimal outcomes during the lockdown. Specific
   technologies and innovations including the Anatomage Table, Complete 3D
   Anatomy software, and the use of High-Fidelity Mannequin were deployed
   to facilitate effective teaching of anatomy and related basic medical
   sciences. This was aided by the robust use of a learning management
   system Canvas, as well as internet facility for connection,
   videoconferencing, online sessions and online-based assessment in a
   strategically organised manner. This system was dynamic enough to
   respond to changes in COVID-19 related government policies including the
   lockdown and social distancing-related adjustments in the physical
   settings. The outcome was that the teaching of medical students did not
   stop, and optimal results were achieved. The article considers the roles
   of educational technology and innovations as well as the media and how
   these were used to achieve learning objectives with optimal outcomes
   during the lockdown. It is believed that this experiential piece would
   inspire and inform other medical schools on the benefit of building
   robustly dynamic medical school systems as well as the use of
   innovations in times of challenges. The article also considers both the
   limitations and benefits of technology in teaching anatomy. Very
   importantly, specific tools, innovations, and technologies were
   considered as used, and the information provided might be a guide for
   other potential users. Ultimately, the lesson learned would be of use to
   us and we believe we could also benefit many others.},

Title = {Scalable and Practical Teaching Practices Faculty Can Deploy to Increase
   Retention: A Faculty Cookbook for Increasing Student Success},
Journal = {EDUCATION FOR CHEMICAL ENGINEERS},
Year = {2020},
Volume = {33},
Pages = {45-65},

Abstract = {Student retention in college is often expected to be handled by
   advisers, staff, and administrators. The uni-versity
   classroom-specifically, the pedagogies and practices that are utilized
   there-is a largely untapped resource in our quest to increase student
   success and retention. Instructional faculty are the only members of an
   academic institution that students are required to interact with
   regularly. For most courses offered in higher education, the contact
   time between faculty and students is typically three hours per week;
   faculty can have a significant impact on student outcomes in that time.
   This paper reviews and discusses scalable and practical teaching
   practices that span the domains of growth mindset, self-efficacy,
   metacognition, and belongingness. These teaching practices helped
   increase student retention by more than 30\% in an entry-level core
   engineering course at our institution. The techniques described in this
   work can be deployed either simultaneously or in discrete sets to help
   students remain engaged in the educational process and successfully
   graduate. Because teaching is a universal practice, the teaching
   practices can be deployed in nearly every discipline and at every
   academic level. Most of the practices are independent of which
   instructional modes are being used, e.g., active learning vs lecturing,
   large vs small classes, or online vs in-person delivery. The specific
   implementation and effectiveness of the teaching practices may differ in
   each of those contexts, particularly with academic age of students, but
   improvements in student success and retention can be expected if the
   framework described here is used. We strongly recommend that a
   reflective process be deployed throughout implementation of the
   different teaching practices. This will allow for personal and
   professional growth in the instructor as they deploy the techniques
   while also improving the efficacy of the techniques themselves over time
   as they are refined for the local teaching environment. Published by
   Elsevier B.V. on behalf of Institution of Chemical Engineers.},

Title = {White-collar crime in academia: Trends in digital academic dishonesty
   over time and their effect on penalty severity},
Journal = {COMPUTERS \& EDUCATION},
Year = {2019},
Volume = {141},
Month = {NOV},
Abstract = {This study explored patterns of change over time in penalties for
   conducting academic dishonesty (AD), following a previous study
   (Friedman Blau \& Eshet-Alkalai, 2016) that reported lower penalties for
   digital AD offenses compared to analog ones across two years. In the
   present study, we examined whether this trend changes over time, and
   what could explain it. We offered two contradicting hypotheses: the
   regulations hypothesis suggests that the gap between penalties for
   analog and digital AD caused since it takes time for academic institutes
   to adjust their regulations to digital dishonesties. Therefore, this gap
   will diminish and eventually disappear. The perception hypothesis
   suggests that the penalty gap will remain stable, since it reflects the
   perception of digital AD as a ``white-collar{''} offense. Contrary to
   previous studies that used self-reported measurements of AD perceptions,
   this study analyzed Disciplinary Committees protocols, which contains a
   more objective descriptions of type of AD, student's explanations, and
   penalty types. These protocols provide information about the actual
   behavior of students and faculty, and not about their opinions. We
   analyzed the entire volume of 628 university's protocols collected
   during four consecutive years. Findings clearly demonstrated that the
   trend of lower penalties for digital offenses remained stable across
   four years. Results support the perception hypothesis, suggest that this
   phenomenon relates to the perception of digital AD as a ``white-collar
   crime{''}. Like other white-collar crimes, is perceived as less harmful
   and therefore, punished less severely than other crimes. This claim is
   also supported by our findings that motivations to behave unethically,
   which students reported to the Discipline Committee, influenced
   penalties' severity in analog, but not in digital settings.
   Unexpectedly, a consistent gender-gap was found in penalties' severity
   for both digital and analog offenses, indicating that women were
   punished more severely than men. This dissimilarity in penalizing AD
   offenses remained stable over the studied period. We discuss theoretical
   and practical implications of these findings.},

Title = {Validation of Internal structure of Self-Directed Learning Readiness
   Scale among Indian Medical Students using factor analysis and the

Abstract = {Background The Self-Directed Learning Readiness Scale (SDLRS) is a tool
   that helps in the assessment of the readiness of the students to pursue
   Self-Directed Learning (SDL). There are no documented studies on the
   validation of internal structure of the SDLRS among Indian medical
   students. Hence, the objective of this study is to validate the internal
   structure of SDLRS among Indian medical students using factor analysis
   and the Structural Equation Modelling (SEM) approach. Methods We
   administered Fisher's 40-item SDLRS to 750 students after receiving the
   ethics clearance and the author's permission and taking written informed
   consent from all the study participants (response rate: 92\%). The
   exploratory factor analysis (EFA), confirmatory factor analysis (CFA),
   and Cronbach's alpha were performed using SPSS version 25 and the Lavaan
   package of R version 3.1.2. Results The values of the comparative fit
   index (CFI), standardised root-mean-square residual (SRMR), and root
   mean square error of approximation (RMSEA) were >= 0.9, <= 0.08, and <=
   0.08, respectively, for a model fit to be acceptable. EFA showed that
   except for Q2 (loading score: 0.210), Q12 (loading score: 0.384), Q13
   (loading score: 0.362), and Q25 (loading score: -0.219), all the items
   loaded well. After the exclusion of the aforementioned items, the factor
   loading scores for the items in the self-management, desire for
   learning, and self-control factors ranged from 0.405 to 0.753 (Cronbach
   alpha: 0.775), 0.396 to 0.616 (Cronbach alpha: 0.730), and 0.427 to
   0.556 (Cronbach alpha: 0.799), respectively. The updated model was used
   for CFA, which displayed a good model fit. Conclusions The resultant
   model consisting of 36 items is shown to have internal structure
   validity for Indian version of SDLRS, which can be used to assess
   medical students.},

Abstract = {Background This study aimed to evaluate the effectiveness and efficiency
   of PBL-CBL combined teaching in thyroid surgery and make observations
   from the students' perspectives, based on their satisfaction with the
   learning process. Methods We prospectively enrolled 354 fourth-year
   students majoring in clinical medicine, along with 232 residents, from
   September 2014 to June 2019. These participants were randomly allocated
   into either the combined PBL-CBL teaching group or the traditional
   lecture-based classroom group to attend a course about thyroid nodules.
   Both pre- and post-class quizzes were conducted. An anonymous
   questionnaire was also administered to both groups to evaluate the
   students' perceptions and experiences. We compared the two teaching
   methods among all the students as well as with the fourth-year students
   and residents in subgroups. Results The traditional group's pre-class
   quiz scores were significantly higher than the PBL-CBL group's (as
   determined by a two-tailed t-test at a 95\% confidence interval, T =
   16.483, P < 0.001). After class, in the PBL-CBL group, the mean total
   quiz score and the basic knowledge and case analysis scores increased
   significantly (P < 0.001). The PBL-CBL group's performance improvement
   was significantly higher than the traditional group's (increasing from
   52.76 to 70.51 vs. from 67.03 to 71.97). Furthermore, the scores for
   learning motivation, understanding, student-teacher interaction, the
   final examination, communication skills, clinical thinking skills,
   self-learning skills, teamwork skills, and knowledge absorption, as
   measured by the survey, were significantly higher in the PBL-CBL group
   than in the traditional group (P < 0.001). Meanwhile, the survey scores
   representing the amount of students' free time the course consumed were
   significantly lower in the PBL-CBL group than in the traditional group
   (P < 0.001). Conclusions PBL combined with CBL may be an effective
   method for improving medical students' and residents' performance and
   enhancing their clinical skills.},

Title = {Learning from a transformation of pedagogical practices in master's

Abstract = {This document shares a critical reflection on the motivation,
   development and results derived from a pedagogical transformation of a
   course of the MPTIC-Masters in Pedagogy of ICT-Information and
   Communication Technologies-University of La Guajira, in Riohacha,
   Colombia. This study may be of interest to those who wish to offer
   flexible learning environments to adults who require to pursue advanced
   training in institutions where they believe in technology-based
   socio-constructivism and where not necessarily there is a single
   educational and operational model to offer learning opportunities.
   Keeping the essence of the seminar methodology that guides the MPTIC and
   the multi-dimensionality that assumes the hybrid learning modality in
   this master's degree program, it was conducted the redesign and testing
   of the second level of a seminar offered to one of the cohorts of the
   MPTIC. In this process the actors were the same as in the first
   level-the same students participated, were guided by the same faculty
   members, and were accompanied by the same managers, but the operational
   model of the second level of the course of interest was adjusted to
   overcome some of the limitations found out in the implementation of the
   first level course. This had the intention of seeking more active
   participation at individual and group level, as well as to achieve
   better qualitative results in the application of what has been learned
   to the teaching environments in which the participants of the MPTIC do
   their deepening projects. This study sought to determine what lessons
   this pedagogical transformation leaves, in the face of its possible
   replication in other courses of the MPTIC and / or in contexts and by
   other actors of advanced training programs at the service of people who
   work and study, and who require making use of flexible learning
   environments. The work leaves to consideration lessons learned and
   recommendations.},

Abstract = {The rapid growth of instructional videos repositories and their
   widespread use as a tool to support education have raised the need of
   studies to assess the quality of those educational resources and their
   impact on the quality of learning process that depends on them. Khan
   Academy (KA) repository is one of the prominent educational videos'
   repositories. It is famous and widely used by different types of
   learners, students and teachers. To better understand its
   characteristics and the impact of such repositories on education, we
   gathered a huge amount of KA data using its API and different web
   scraping techniques, then we analyzed them. This paper reports the first
   quantitative and descriptive analysis of Khan Academy repository (KA
   repository) of open video lessons. First, we described the structure of
   repository. Then, we demonstrated some analyses highlighting
   content-based growth and evolution. Those descriptive analyses spotted
   the main important findings in KA repository. Finally, we focused on
   users' interactions with video lessons. Those interactions consisted of
   questions and answers posted on videos. We developed interaction
   profiles for those videos based on the number of users' interactions. We
   conducted regression analysis and statistical tests to mine the relation
   between those profiles and some quality related proposed metrics. The
   results of analysis showed that all interaction profiles are highly
   affected by video length and reuse rate in different subjects. We
   believe that our study demonstrated in this paper provides valuable
   information in understanding the logic and the learning mechanism inside
   learning repositories, which can have major impacts on the education
   field in general, and particularly on the informal learning process and
   the instructional design process. This study can be considered as one of
   the first quantitative studies to shed the light on Khan Academy as an
   open educational resources (OER) repository. The results presented in
   this paper are crucial in understanding KA videos repository, its
   characteristics and its impact on education.},

Abstract = {The problem of empirical assessment of various aspects of learning in
   the digital educational environment seems to be of particular relevance.
   At the same time, it is emphasized that there is a lack of comparative
   studies of students' educational outcomes at different levels of higher
   education who have completed e-courses. The study was conducted at the
   Moscow State University of Psychology and Education (MSUPE), the sample
   size is N = 424 students. Subject of the study is immediate and
   long-term academic achievements of students in two levels of higher
   education who completed e-courses. Purpose of the study is to evaluate
   the differences in the academic achievements and knowledge retention of
   graduate and undergraduate students. Key findings of students' academic
   outcomes comparative analysis are the following: (1) No differences were
   found between graduate and undergraduate students in the pretest, final
   test and overall e-course grade indicators.(2) The same tendency was
   revealed in students of both groups: pretest scores are low, post-test
   scores significantly and strongly increase, and then after 1.5-4 months
   they significantly decrease, while remaining significantly higher than
   the input indicators. The knowledge retention scores are very scattered
   in comparison with the direct ones.(3) The gain score effect size and
   the improvement index are significant for the final test only without
   adjusting for clustering, i.e. ignoring the fact that the sample
   consists of several student groups. A median graduate student would have
   a higher score than a median undergraduate student. Cluster-level effect
   size is not statistically significant. Cluster-level effect size for
   overall e-course grade indicators with difference-in-differences
   adjustment is also not reliable.(4) The knowledge retention scores in
   both students' categories do not differ. The gain score effect sizes for
   knowledge retention, taking into account both the final test and the
   pretest, are not significant. (5) The psychometric characteristics of
   the academic achievement test in the field of empirical data
   quantitative analysis can be considered satisfactory.},

Title = {Research trends in the use of augmented reality in science education:
   Content and bibliometric mapping analysis},
Journal = {COMPUTERS \& EDUCATION},
Year = {2019},
Volume = {142},
Month = {DEC},
Abstract = {The aim of this study was to reveal research trends over the last six
   years by content analysis and to examine bibliometric results of
   articles related to the use of augmented reality (AR) in science
   education. For bibliometric mapping analysis, a total of 147 articles
   were accessed and for content analysis, a total of 79 articles published
   between 2013 and 2018 years were included from the Web of Science. From
   this, a total of 62 articles were selected for analysis. Our results
   revealed that mobile learning, science education, science learning and
   e-learning were the most used keywords in articles, while the focus of
   more recent articles tended to be on mobile learning. The results showed
   that recent articles have mostly focused on mobile learning and
   e-learning environments. The most-used words in the abstracts were
   education, knowledge, science education, experiment and effectiveness.
   It is evident that recent articles have focused mostly on students'
   knowledge and achievement. Azuma, Dunleavy and Klopfer are the most
   cited authors in this field. This is not surprising as they are probably
   the leading authors on AR in the literature. The most cited journals are
   Computers \& Education, Journal of Science Education \& Technology,
   Educational Technology and Society, Computers in Human Behavior, and
   British Journal of Educational Technology. These are the most prominent
   journals on the use of technology in education. Content analysis results
   showed that ``Learning/Academic Achievement{''}, ``Motivation{''} and
   ``Attitude{''} have been the most examined variables in the articles.
   Since academic achievement is highly influenced by motivation and
   attitude, it is understandable that these variables are considered
   together in reviewed studies. It was found that mobile applications and
   marker-based materials on paper have been the most-favored types of
   materials for AR because these types of materials are easy to use and
   they can be developed easily and practically. Quantitative studies were
   the most used research design type but there have been only a limited
   number of qualitative studies in the last six years. This may be due to
   the increased tendency to use quantitative and mixed studies in recent
   years.},

Abstract = {The study presents the results of an experiment in methodological
   development in vocational teacher training. The author describes his own
   professional experience based on a four-year higher education
   pedagogical experiment. The experiment was carried out within the
   framework of a four-semester specialist teacher training program that
   leads to a pedagogical qualification. Students on the course have
   usually undertaken several years of internship, and several of them are
   instructors in vocational training, adult education, or higher
   education. From a pedagogical point of view, the experiment presented in
   the article is also special because it presents the in-service training
   of teachers who teach in secondary education within a university
   framework. Based on feedback from previous years, students considered
   the obligation to prepare diploma dissertations to be either a formal
   obligation only, or a ``necessary evil.{''} The diploma dissertation
   that concludes the course takes the form of a professional dissertation,
   the topic of which is defined by the department and selected by the
   student, and represents the mandatory and almost exclusive form of
   individual assessment related to the student's final exam. The four-year
   higher-education pedagogical experiment described in the article
   presents the first results of a method for replacing the diploma thesis
   with the preparation of a portfolio. The article shows what kind of
   pedagogical change in methods a portfolio-type diploma thesis requires,
   and what the important elements of this are. It shows the effectiveness
   of assessment based on a portfolio-based dissertation using feedback
   from students from the last four years of the course, the former which
   was integrated into a proactive pedagogical framework in a comprehensive
   way during the experiment. The article also sets out the general
   conditions for doing this that may be relevant for other training
   courses, in particular in engineering and the social sciences.
   The topicality of the article is also strengthened by social and
   professional expectations surrounding higher education. Consequently,
   the author of the article presents this experiment in higher education
   pedagogical design not as an opportunity, but as an essential
   innovation.},

Title = {An e-learning pediatric cardiology curriculum for Pediatric Postgraduate
   trainees in Rwanda: implementation and evaluation},
Journal = {BMC MEDICAL EDUCATION},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {22},
Number = {1},
Month = {MAR 16},
Abstract = {Background Access to pediatric sub-specialty training is a critical
   unmet need in many resource-limited settings. In Rwanda, only two
   pediatric cardiologists are responsible for the country's clinical care
   of a population of 12 million, along with the medical education of all
   pediatric trainees. To strengthen physician training opportunities, we
   developed an e-learning curriculum in pediatric cardiology. This
   curriculum aimed to ``flip the classroom{''}, allowing residents to
   learn key pediatric cardiology concepts digitally before an in-person
   session with the specialist, thus efficiently utilizing the specialist
   for additional case based and bedside teaching. Methods We surveyed
   Rwandan and US faculty and residents using a modified Delphi approach to
   identify key topics in pediatric cardiology. Lead authors from Rwanda
   and the USA collaborated with OPENPediatrics (TM), a free digital
   knowledge-sharing platform, to produce ten core topics presented in
   structured videos spanning 4.5 h. A mixed methods evaluation was
   completed with Rwandan pediatric residents, including surveys assessing
   knowledge, utilization, and satisfaction. Qualitative analysis of
   structured interviews was conducted using NVivo. Results Among the 43
   residents who participated in the OPENPediatrics (TM) cardiology
   curriculum, 33 (77\%) completed the curriculum assessment. Residents
   reported using the curriculum for a median of 8 h. Thirty-eight (88\%)
   reported viewing the curriculum on their personal or hospital computer
   via pre-downloaded materials on a USB flash drive, with another seven
   (16\%) reporting viewing it online. Twenty-seven residents viewed the
   course during core lecture time (63\%). Commonly reported barriers to
   utilization included lack of time (70\%), access to internet (40\%) and
   language (24\%). Scores on knowledge assessment improved from 66.2\% to
   76.7\% upon completion of the curriculum (p < 0.001) across all levels
   of training, with most significant improvement in scores for PGY-1 and
   PGY-2 residents. Residents reported high satisfaction with the visuals,
   engaging presentation, and organization of the curriculum. Residents
   opined the need for expanded training material in cardiac
   electrocardiogram and echocardiogram and requested for slower narration
   by foreign presenters. Conclusion Video-based e-learning via
   OPENPediatrics (TM) in a resource-limited setting was effective in
   improving resident's knowledge in pediatric cardiology with high levels
   of utilization and satisfaction. Expanding access to digital curriculums
   for other pediatric sub-specialties may be both an effective and
   efficient strategy for improving training in settings with limited
   access to subspecialist faculty.},

Title = {Skepticism and learning difficulties in a digital environment at the
   Bachelor's and Master's levels: are preconceptions valid?},
Journal = {HELIYON},
Year = {2020},
Volume = {6},
Number = {11},
Month = {NOV},
Abstract = {There are a number of beliefs and preconceptions concerning online
   learning in university digital environment. Are they valid? The study
   aimed to compare perceived learning experiences of students who
   completed the e-course with flipped design, to identify the set of
   opinions common to the majority of students and assess differences of
   perceived experiences between graduate and undergraduate students. The
   target groups were students at the Bachelor's (N = 183) and Master's (N
   = 161) levels participating in e-courses in mathematical methods in
   psychological and educational researches (N = 344 in total). The
   quasi-experimental study was conducted at the Moscow State University of
   Psychology and Education (MSUPE). Using cluster analysis method for each
   of the 5 thematic groups of the survey points, 2 clusters were
   identified, typical opinions spectrum of the respondents majority was
   characterized, and differences between learners at the Bachelor's and
   Master's levels in these clusters were estimated. (1) For only one topic
   regarding students' learning independence, interaction and engagement,
   the share of master's programs students in a large cluster significantly
   prevails, for the remaining 4 topics there were no differences: ca
   70-75\% of both levels students belonged to a large cluster. (2) Most
   students confirm the benefits of e-courses, no substantial difficulties
   were identified. This contradicts the preconception that older Master's
   level students more troublesome adapt to digital environment learning,
   experience more difficulties and are more critical. (3) Most respondents
   at both levels show a positive motivation for learning in a digital
   environment. This contradicts the preconception that graduate students
   are more skeptical of e-learning. (4) Most students confirm the
   interactive style of blended sessions' activities, i.e., mutual
   assistance and interaction with classmates and the instructor, but they
   more often perceive deficiency of personal contacts with the instructor
   and do not agree to replace face-to-face sessions with webinars and
   communication on forums. This set of opinions is more characteristic of
   graduate students. Perhaps this is partly a reflection of main beliefs
   of instructors supported the full-time education. (5) Almost all
   students find the e-course informative and practically useful. (6) Most
   of the respondents are characterized by careful answers to points
   concerning the use of dishonest strategies in online learning and the
   belief that dishonest strategies using is inevitable. Perhaps this is a
   reflection of their life experiences or an excuse for their own
   dishonest strategies. This problem requires further investigation.},

Title = {Longitudinal curriculum development: gradual optimization of a
   biochemistry seminar},
Journal = {GMS JOURNAL FOR MEDICAL EDUCATION},
Year = {2019},
Volume = {36},
Number = {6},
Abstract = {Objective: The Master Plan for Medical Studies 2020 places additional
   emphasis on curricular development processes. In addition, institutes
   may recognize a need to optimize their courses, for example because of
   poor evaluations. Frequently, however, the resources required for
   comprehensive optimizations are not available. In the present study, we
   aimed to use the example of a biochemistry seminar that takes place in
   the preclinical part of the medical degree at Ulm University Medical
   School to show how a course can be successfully optimized in small steps
   and evaluation results can be used for quality assurance.
   Methods: Similar to a continuous improvement process (CIP), over the
   course of five years a biochemistry seminar was gradually optimized in
   three steps. This process used structural, methodological, and content
   components, such as vertical integration, the inverted classroom method,
   and competence orientation. For quality assurance, we analyzed the
   official, standardized evaluation sheets from a total of n=1248
   students. We evaluated the optimization process on the basis of
   1. responses to evaluation statements that were arranged into categories
   such as ``organization, structure, implementation{''} and ``quality of
   teaching,{''}
   2. free text information, and
   3. the results of a pilot study conducted in parallel.
   We then determined the usefulness of the students evaluation results for
   evaluating the optimization process.
   Results: Each developmental step resulted in a significantly more
   positive overall evaluation of the seminar by the students. This result
   was independent of whether the development was on a structural or
   methodological/content-related level. In addition, the evaluations of
   the categories that were optimized were significantly better. For
   example, the vertical integration and introduction of the inverted
   classroom method were accompanied by a better evaluation of the
   ``quality of teaching{''} and a change in the structure led to a higher
   score in the category ``organization, structure, implementation.{''} A
   comparison with the free text evaluation sheets and the results of the
   pilot study supports the results.
   Conclusion: Although optimization of a curriculum or course is a major
   task, it can also be successfully completed in small steps. With this
   approach, new learning goals, for example as required in the Master Plan
   for Medical Studies 2020, can be continuously integrated and student
   satisfaction with a course can be increased. Student evaluation results
   can represent a kind of quality assurance in this process and can
   provide important impulses for optimization.},

Title = {Digital technologies in undergraduate and postgraduate education in
   occupational therapy and physiotherapy: a scoping review},
Journal = {JBI EVIDENCE SYNTHESIS},
Year = {2020},
Volume = {18},
Number = {5},
Pages = {863-892},
Month = {MAY},
Abstract = {Objective: The objective of this scoping review was to map research in
   the use of digital technologies in occupational therapy and
   physiotherapy education in terms of the type of digital technology used,
   how the digital technology is applied, and the author-reported outcomes
   of digital technology use.
   Introduction: The ubiquitous nature of digital technology has influenced
   higher education, offering benefits of integrating digital technologies
   into curricula. However, the extent of the application of digital
   technologies in higher education in occupational therapy and
   physiotherapy warrants investigation. This scoping review mapped the
   reported applications of digital technology in both undergraduate and
   postgraduate occupational therapy and physiotherapy education.
   Inclusion criteria: Research studies on the use of digital technology in
   undergraduate and/or postgraduate education in occupational therapy
   and/or physiotherapy were considered for inclusion in this scoping
   review.
   Methods: A comprehensive search strategy using multiple databases was
   employed to find relevant studies. Keywords and the derivatives of
   ``digital technology,{''} ``education,{''} ``occupational therapy{''}
   and ``physiotherapy{''} were used. The databases searched included
   MEDLINE via PubMed, the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials,
   Physiotherapy Evidence Database (PEDro), EBSCOhost Education Research
   Complete, EBSCOhost ERIC, EBSCOhost MasterFILE Premier, EBSCOhost CINAHL
   Complete, OT Database, OT Seeker and Scopus. Google Scholar was also
   searched. The filter ``humans{''} was applied, where possible.
   Peer-reviewed qualitative and quantitative research studies were
   considered for inclusion. Owing to the rapid development of
   technologies, studies that were published from January 2013 to April
   2019 were included. This review only included papers available in
   English. The relevant studies and their reported outcomes were organized
   and analyzed thematically.
   Results: The initial search yielded 2853 articles. Title, abstract and
   full-text review yielded 52 suitable papers meeting criteria. The final
   data set represented 4038 participants. Data were analyzed according to
   three main categories, namely, type of technology used, application of
   digital technology and author-reported outcomes. The review showed that
   occupational therapy and physiotherapy educators have used a wide
   variety of digital technologies, including quizzes, videos, social
   media, learning management systems and content repositories. Digital
   technologies have been applied in a range of learning and teaching
   contexts, including feedback and assessment, clinical skills and
   techniques, professional behaviors, clinical reasoning and fieldwork
   supervision. Author-reported outcomes varied between studies and were
   associated with student factors (e.g. anxiety, self-efficacy), technical
   difficulties when implementing digital technology, as well as financial
   costs.
   Conclusion: A wide variety of digital technologies can support learning
   and teaching across many contexts in occupational therapy and
   physiotherapy education. Technology should not be used in isolation and
   must be aligned to the proposed learning outcomes. Studies highlight the
   need for face-to-face contact with lecturers and fellow students in
   addition to the use of digital technology.},

Title = {Do socio-cultural differences matter? A study of the learning effects
   and satisfaction with physical activity from digital learning
   assimilated into a university dance course},
Journal = {COMPUTERS \& EDUCATION},

Abstract = {In recent years, due to the advancement of digital learning and flipped
   learning (FL, a student-centered approach that reverses traditional
   pedagogy by providing students with content usually taught in class for
   their learning in advance), there have been some major changes in
   teaching models for various disciplines. Learning can be ubiquitous
   through utilization of technology so teaching is no longer limited by
   time, space, psychological state, or geopolitical borders. This is
   helpful for learners to form a habit of lifelong learning. In this
   study, we applied technology and the strategy of digital instruction to
   dance curricula, integrating blended learning (BL, which combines online
   and face-to-face classes) and FL for the purpose of making comparisons
   with the traditional teaching method (C). A 10-week experiment was
   performed with 290 participants from 6 amateur dance classes. The
   researchers investigated, via quasi-experiments, the effects of BL and
   FL on developing students' learning effects and physical activity class
   satisfaction in this online dance course. A 2 (Taiwanese students vs.
   foreign students) x 3 (BL vs. FL vs. C) design, as well as factorial
   pretest/posttest design, was employed in this experiment. The selected
   course for the experiment is titled ``Physical Education: Dance{''}, a
   one-semester, required course for the four involved classes of students
   at a comprehensive university. All students in this study came from
   non-dance departments. The purpose of this experiment was to explore the
   influences of different teaching methods on the effectiveness of
   learning dance skills among Taiwanese and foreign students as well as
   their satisfaction with this approach in a physical activity course. The
   results and conclusions of this research are that, compared to those
   taught with the traditional method, the Taiwanese students taught with
   the BL approach achieved higher learning effects in dance skills and
   were more satisfied in the aspects of cognitive development, fun, degree
   of enjoyment, diversified experience, and degree of relaxation in this
   physical activity course. Moreover, compared to those taught with the
   traditional method, the ones taught with the FL approach were more
   satisfied in the aspects of teacher's instruction, cognitive
   development, physical health condition, improvement in physical
   capability, diversified experience, and degree of relaxation. As for the
   foreign students, compared to those taught with the traditional method,
   the ones taught with the BL approach or the FL approach achieved higher
   learning effects in dance skills.
   However, there was no significant difference found in their satisfaction
   with this physical activity course. Finally, this study suggests that
   teachers who teach dance-related classes consider integrating the BL
   approach or the FL approach based on the backgrounds and characteristics
   of their students, in order to improve their learning effects and
   increase their satisfaction with various aspects of physical activities.},
