Abstract = {Many reports in dental education showed that student learning improved
   with the flipped classroom method. However, there are few reports that
   describe how different subsets of students may benefit from the flipped
   classroom. In this study, we investigated how students' preference for
   the flipped classroom impacted their learning outcome. We used a flipped
   classroom module on the physiology of the autonomic nervous system
   taught to year one Doctor of Dental Surgery students to test the
   hypothesis that students who favored the flipped classroom performed
   better on assessment quizzes. The module was composed of pre-class
   activity, out-of-class assignment, in-class discussion, and two in-class
   quizzes. Quiz 1 was given after students self-studied the foundational
   content online through the pre-class activity, and Quiz 2 was at the end
   of the module. Students filled out a survey to report learning
   experiences and preferences. Fewer students scored below 75\% on Quiz 2
   than on Quiz 1. Students' self-evaluated understanding of content
   significantly improved after finishing the assignment and discussion
   compared to finishing the pre-class activity alone. Moreover, students
   who preferred to learn through the flipped classroom scored higher in
   Quiz 2. Students with higher overall grades in the course preferred the
   flipped classroom more than low performers. Our results indicated that
   students favoring the flipped classroom method spent more time on the
   assignment, understood the content better, and performed better on
   assessments than students who prefer traditional lectures.},

Abstract = {Purpose of ReviewThe purpose of this review is to describe the flipped
   classroom, its advantages and disadvantages, its use specifically in
   medical education, and directions for future research. The flipped
   classroom is an instructional model in which the traditional lecture is
   delivered in a video format before class. The in-class time is spent on
   active, inquiry-based learning facilitated by an instructor.Recent
   FindingsThe flipped classroom is rapidly gaining in interest and
   popularity, and being increasingly implemented in medical education at
   all levels. Despite its many theoretical advantages, there are a variety
   of pros and cons that educators should consider when adopting this
   methodology. Overall, research findings to date support use of the
   flipped classroom in regard to learner preference and satisfaction;
   however, further studies are needed to determine its true effect on
   learning outcomes.SummaryThe flipped classroom is a relatively new
   educational modality that can potentially promote learner-centered,
   self-directed, active learning. There is significant potential for
   educational researchers who wish to develop assessment tools capable of
   evaluating deeper learning, particularly within the flipped classroom
   framework.},

Abstract = {This study investigated the effect of flipped classroom on computer
   science students' engagement level among pre-university students.
   Computer science students were observed to be less engaged during the
   lecture of information system topic. Students fail to answer questions
   which need them to apply information system concepts into the real world
   situation. Hence, the flipped classroom approach is explored to solve
   the problem. With the increase in the usage of smart phones among
   students in higher learning institutions, cheaper prices of smart
   phones, mobile data plan and ready availability of instructional videos
   on the internet, the flipped classroom approach seems to be a perfect
   practice to be implemented. Therefore this research made use of the
   flipped classroom approach to gauge its efficacy on college students.
   Quasi experimental posttest only design was used in this research.
   Students were divided into two groups, namely a control group (didactic
   classroom) consisting of 41 students and an experimental group (flipped
   classroom) consisting of 43 students. These samples were chosen using
   purposive sampling. Students in the experimental group were required to
   watch a micro-lecture prior to coming to class and were involved in
   engaging activities in the classroom. After the intervention, both
   groups were measured in terms of their engagement level in class using a
   four-level Likert scale questionnaire which consisted of four engagement
   constructs namely behavioral, agentic, cognitive and emotional
   engagement constructs. Flipped classroom students' behavioral mean was
   3.04, agentic mean was 3.06, cognitive mean was 3.16 and emotional mean
   3.42. Findings showed that from the questionnaire, it was clear that the
   students in the experimental group (flipped classroom) were highly
   engaged. However, there was not much difference in terms of student
   engagement in the flipped classroom when compared to the didactic
   classroom.},

Abstract = {The Flipped Classroom Model is a particular type of Blended Learning
   Model that enables more active learning in the classroom environment. In
   other words, by dismissing the traditional teaching method, the Flipped
   Classroom Model provides an active learning environment with classroom
   activities. Students learn by making use of information and
   communication technologies. Students watch videos about their course
   whenever they want and take notes before coming to class. Instead of
   providing students with lecture notes before each lesson, videos are
   assigned to be watched. Therefore, in this research, it aims to identify
   the teacher candidates' views regarding project development training
   carried out with the Flipped Classroom approach. The research is
   composed of qualitative data collected from 21 teacher candidates
   studying their final year at the university. The research findings
   indicated that teacher candidates are satisfied with applying the
   Flipped Classroom approach as it increased curiosity and willingness of
   the participants towards the multimedia development course. It is also
   found that the majority of the teacher candidates produced complimentary
   views regarding the project development training carried out with the
   Flipped Classroom approach.},

Abstract = {Background To address some challenges that the large lecture-focused
   courses have faced in higher education, the flipped classroom model was
   implemented in mechanical engineering. The purpose of the study was to
   investigate mechanical engineering undergraduate students' performance
   in the flipped classroom. A comprehensive analysis was conducted to
   investigate the pedagogical benefits of active learning in the flipped
   classroom from a self-determination theory perspective. To evaluate the
   effectiveness of the flipped classroom, students' academic achievements
   in the flipped classroom were compared with the ones in the traditional
   lecture format. Moreover, to explore in-depth students' learning
   experiences and their perceptions about the flipped classroom, students'
   open-ended surveys were analyzed. Results Results demonstrated that
   students in the flipped classroom performed better and favored the new
   model, feeling that flipped classroom was useful and helpful in
   preparing for the course. The qualitative findings showed that students
   felt that they benefited from the pre-week online lectures in the
   flipped classroom to prepare for the course. Conclusions The current
   study shows that the flipped classroom model has the potential to create
   an autonomy-supportive learning environment and provide beneficial
   learning experiences. This study highlights the benefits of and future
   direction for implementing the flipped classroom in traditional
   mechanical engineering courses.},

Abstract = {Flipped classroom provides the new ideas and ways for the innovation of
   university pedagogical mode. Nowadays instructors may apply this new
   approach to liberal arts majors in university class in order to make up
   for the problems of low instructional effects in traditional teaching
   method. From the subjective and objective perspectives, this research
   analyzes experimentally the similarities and differences of
   instructional effects among traditional teaching method, semi-flipped
   classroom approach and full flipped classroom approach in electronic
   business course in university. The results show that two kinds of
   flipped classroom approaches can produce better instructional effects
   relative to traditional teaching method. Moreover, semi-flipped
   classroom approach is more suitable for liberal arts specialties in
   university compared to full flipped classroom approach. Lastly, flipped
   classroom approach only achieves its instructional effects after a
   period of time.},

Abstract = {We report on an effort to measure the effect of replacing traditional
   lecture-based teaching in calculus with a flipped-classroom approach. We
   base the comparison between the two teaching models on data from three
   sources: (a) a Calculus Baseline Test, designed specifically for this
   purpose and given as pre-test and post-test; (b) a survey measuring
   student engagement; and (c) student achievement on the final exam. On
   the Calculus Baseline Test, we found that the normalized gain was 13\%
   higher in the flipped-classroom group. Similarly, the flipped-classroom
   group scored significantly higher on the engagement survey. Also, the
   students of the flipped-classroom group performed much better than
   expected on the final exam of the course, with a substantial decrease in
   failure rate.},

Abstract = {The flipped classroom model is a new method in education by reversing
   the usual learning and teaching processes. The main purpose of this
   study is to reveal the opinions and perceptions of the students about
   the flipped classroom model. The research was conducted in a course
   designed as blended learning, which was followed both face to face and
   online. A case study design was used in this qualitative research. The
   research group of the study consisted of 35 undergraduate students who
   took a course designed with the flipped classroom model in the 2017-2018
   academic year. The data were collected through online semi-structured
   open-ended questions. The data were analyzed through content analysis.
   As a result of the analysis, five themes related to the flipped
   classroom model emerged. The themes are active learning, cognitive
   readiness, reinforcement, course preparation, fun learning, and
   permanent learning. The fmdings of this promising method of learning are
   similar to the findings in the literature. Within this context, it is
   recommended to use the flipped classroom 2.0 model in teaching
   processes.},

Title = {Undergraduate international students' challenges in a flipped classroom
   environment: An Australian perspective},
Journal = {INNOVATIONS IN EDUCATION AND TEACHING INTERNATIONAL},
Abstract = {Flipped classroom approaches have increasingly been adopted in the
   Australian higher education sector. However, current research on this
   approach is predominantly quantitative and focused on domestic students.
   Little is known about the flipped classroom learning experiences of
   undergraduate international students in Australia. This paper sets out
   to investigate undergraduate international students' challenges in a
   flipped classroom environment, based on thirty-two semi-structured
   interviews with undergraduate international students at an Australian
   university. We identified several challenges, including language issues,
   barriers to autonomous learning, as well as technical and technological
   challenges. International students in our study also provide
   constructive recommendations to improve the design of the flipped
   classroom. This paper contributes new insights into the nuances of
   undergraduate international students' challenges in a flipped classroom
   environment.},

Abstract = {The study aimed to examine university students' level of access to the
   digital technologies needed for flipped learning and their perceptions
   of a flipped classroom instructional model in an educational
   technology-related course. A mixed methods study design was used which
   included a survey and a pre-post quasi-experiment. The use of the
   flipped classroom approach lasted for ten weeks. The participants were
   27 female students enrolled in a `Principles of Educational Computing'
   course in the first semester of the 2017/2018 academic year at a
   university in Kuwait. Data were collected using a questionnaire and
   interviews over two rounds. The results showed that the students had
   easy access to the needed digital technologies for flipped learning,
   including video technology. The study examined students' perceptions of
   flipped classroom learning before and after the use of the flipped
   classroom instructional model. The great majority had positive
   perceptions of the use of flipped classroom learning; the reasons for
   their positive perceptions were mainly related to the ease of use of the
   video technology and the pedagogical advantages of the flipped classroom
   model. Based on students' feedback, the study provided recommendations
   for higher education that are related to ways of implementing flipped
   classroom instructional approaches.},

Abstract = {Background: The purpose of this study was to evaluate student learning
   outcomes in a flipped classroom versus a traditional classroom in a
   podiatric medical school. To date no published reports in podiatric
   medical schools have used the flipped classroom for the entirety of a
   medical school course.
   Methods: Students from the class of 2017 completed the Emergency
   Medicine and Trauma course using traditional classroom lectures, and the
   class of 2018 used a flipped classroom approach. Each class took two
   assessments that contained 99 identical questions and completed a
   postcourse evaluation that contained student comments. A multivariate
   analysis of covariance was conducted to determine whether student
   performances were significantly affected by the differences in the
   teaching method. Student evaluation comments were analyzed using textual
   data analysis to determine the sentiments that students expressed
   regarding their exposure to the teaching method.
   Results: The multivariate analysis of covariance results revealed that
   students scored slightly lower on assessments during the flipped
   classroom delivery compared with the traditional classroom delivery,
   when adjusted for Medical College Admission Test scores and grade point
   average, but not significantly (P = .4340). Similarly, the sentiment
   analysis of student comments indicated that the average positive
   sentiment score for the flipped classroom delivery was higher but was
   not significant (P = .08914).
   Conclusions: The analysis showed there was not a statistically
   significant change in examination scores based on teaching method.
   Sentiment analysis revealed that student sentiments were more positive
   with the flipped classroom group compared with the traditional lecture
   group, although not statistically significantly.},

Abstract = {The purpose of this study is to examine the effects of the flipped
   classroom strategy to preparatory year instruction on student's
   self-regulation and social connectedness. A quasi-experimental
   pre-post-test design conducted with 160 university students enrolled in
   three educational tracks (health, engineering and science). The students
   were divided into two groups: an experimental flipped classroom group
   and a control group. Experimental group was taught via flipped
   classroom, while the control group taught via traditional strategy. The
   levels of self-regulation and social connectedness were measured through
   questionnaire at the beginning and the end of the classes. The results
   based on ANOVA analysis reported that students in flipped classroom had
   shown significantly higher level of self-regulation and social
   connectedness compared to students in the traditional group. Based on
   the obtained findings, self-regulated learning and social connectedness
   were successful in making significant improvements among students
   exposed to flipped classroom mode compared to their counterparts in the
   traditional group. The results demonstrate that flipped classroom
   strategy can be used to promote self-regulated learning and enhancing
   students' social connectedness.},

Abstract = {The aim of this study is to examine the trends and main findings of the
   studies concerning the flipped classroom method in the field of English
   language teaching (ELT). For this purpose, databases including Web of
   Science, Eric, Taylor \& Francis and the Educational full text EBSCO
   were reviewed, and a total of 43 articles were analysed. Systematic
   review was used as the research methodology. The articles were analysed
   utilising a content analysis method. The findings of the study revealed
   that the flipped classroom method in ELT gained popularity among
   researchers after 2014, and the number of the studies in the field
   rapidly increased in the last two years (2016-2017). In addition, the
   most commonly used research methods in flipped classroom in ELT studies
   were found to be mixed and quantitative methods. In the examined
   studies, speaking and writing abilities were the most commonly studied
   language skills. Further analysis revealed challenges, as well as
   benefits related to the use of the flipped classroom method in English
   as a foreign language (EFL) classroom. Additionally, in studies reviewed
   concerning the effectiveness of the flipped classroom methods, the
   findings mostly pointed to the benefits of the flipped classroom method.
   On the basis of the review, various suggestions are made for
   practitioners and future research.},

Abstract = {Objective. To examine the evidence of the effectiveness of flipped
   classroom compared to traditional lecture.
   Methods. Experimental and observational studies were included and
   obtained through searches of PubMed, Education Resources Information
   Center (ERIC), and Google Scholar. Publications from January 1, 2000
   through July 1, 2017 were included. Studies were eligible for this
   research if: (a) the study compared student outcomes using flipped
   classroom versus lecture and (b) at least one outcome measure was final
   examination score or final course score. This analysis used a random
   effects model with weighted mean difference (WMD) as the outcome.
   Results. Six studies were included in the qualitative synthesis and five
   were included in the quantitative synthesis. To date, there has only
   been one prospective randomized comparison of flipped classroom to
   lecture in student pharmacist education. When comparing final
   examination scores, there was no significant difference between flipped
   classroom and lecture based instruction. Only two studies examined the
   effect of flipped classroom compared to lecture on final course score.
   This analysis also found no significant difference.
   Conclusion. Despite a lack of prospective randomized studies, findings
   from this meta-analysis suggest that flipped classroom may be associated
   with minimal gains in student knowledge compared to lecture. These
   findings are important because previous research has estimated that the
   flipped classroom requires more time to develop and implement. Future
   studies using prospective randomized designs need to be conducted before
   widespread adoption.},

Abstract = {The flipped classroom is becoming a very popular teaching method in the
   educational context. However, there are currently not enough scientific
   investigations that make it possible to support the suitability of the
   flipped classroom as an ideal method for all areas and educational
   levels. The object of this research was to analyse academic performance
   and university student satisfaction and perception of the educational
   experience of the use of the flipped classroom. The study followed a
   mixed design which assessed the students' academic performance using
   quantitative techniques, and their satisfaction and perception of the
   flipped classroom method, as well as those of their teachers, using
   qualitative techniques. The total sample was composed of 94 university
   students. The results reveal that the students obtained better academic
   results with the flipped classroom than with the traditional method. The
   students also highlighted that the flipped classroom method made it
   possible for them to make a better use of their time and achieve better
   learning. As disadvantages of this method they underlined the investment
   in time that was necessary to make suitable use of the method and the
   importance of the quality of the technological resources used. It can be
   concluded that the flipped classroom method is suitable for the
   university context as it enhances the acquisition of the contents and
   motivates the students, but requires adequate technological means.},

Abstract = {This study aimed to investigate the effectiveness of a flipped classroom
   for students' academic performance and satisfaction. A mixed methods
   research design was used to compare the two approaches of a traditional
   lecture and flipped classroom. Data were gathered via an achievement
   test, survey questionnaire and interviews, and then analysed. The
   results indicated a statistically significant difference in students'
   academic performance for the flipped classroom group. Additionally,
   almost all students had a high level of satisfaction in the flipped
   classroom and generally enjoyed learning in the flipped classroom
   environment. Online materials, peer discussions and the instructor's
   role were fundamental elements that produced high-quality learning and
   active learners. However, few students reported some issues that
   considered as the main obstacles encountered by some students, which
   were the week computer skills and time-consuming tasks. This study's
   implications and recommendations for further research are discussed.},

Abstract = {The flipped classroom is gaining acceptance in higher education as an
   alternative to more traditional methods of teaching. In the current
   study, twelve students in a Norwegian higher education institution were
   in-depth interviewed about their learning experiences in a two-semester
   long mathematics course. The first semester was taught using flipped
   classroom and the second semester using lectures, where both teaching
   modes contained a substantial amount of active learning. Overall,
   students report a more positive learning experience and higher
   engagement in the flipped classroom. The analysis revealed seven
   categories that the students highlight as especially conducive to their
   learning; commitment to peers, being recognized, feeling safe,
   instructor relationship, physical learning environment, learning with
   peers and using videos to learn new content. The results indicate that
   the affective dimension of student engagement is particularly prominent
   when students reflect upon learning in the flipped classroom.},

Abstract = {This qualitative case study aims to explore pre-school prospective
   teachers' flipped classroom experiences while creating digital stories
   collaboratively. 70 pre-school prospective teachers who enrolled to the
   Basic Information and Communication Technology course participated in
   the study. The design of flipped classroom sessions includes
   pre-recorded lectures and in-class group activities on digital
   storytelling. Data was collected through demographic and open-ended
   questionnaires as well as focus group interview in 2018-2019 Spring
   Semester. The prospective teachers reported quite an experience with
   their flipped classroom approach including digital storytelling. They
   intend to use flipped classroom in different subject areas. Prospective
   teachers explained this experience is considered as unique and
   challenging. According to prospective teachers this experience had been
   considered as unique and challenging as they faced with both an
   innovative teaching approach and the requirement of creating educational
   digital stories. A key finding was that although flipped classroom
   itself is a distinctive and challenging process, prospective teachers
   have shown a high degree of satisfaction towards flipped classroom. Even
   though they struggled during digital story creation process which is a
   novel process for them, the flipped classroom design might enhance the
   learning experience. Moreover, they had positive experience about
   technology use in this experience and preschool age. In their future
   profession, they would use not only the technological applications and
   tools they encountered but also flipped classroom.},

Abstract = {Contribution: A flipped classroom approach to teaching empirical
   software engineering increases student learning by providing more time
   for active learning in class. Background: There is a need for
   longitudinal studies of the flipped classroom approach in general.
   Although a few cross-sectional studies show that a flipped classroom
   approach can increase student learning by providing more time for other
   in-class activities, such as active learning, such studies are also rare
   in the context of teaching software engineering. Intended Outcomes: To
   assess the usefulness of a flipped classroom approach in teaching
   software engineering. Application Design: The study was conducted at an
   international master's program in Sweden, given in English, and
   partially replicated at a university in Africa. Findings: The results
   suggest that students' academic success, as measured by their exam
   grades, can be improved by introducing a flipped classroom to teach
   software engineering topics, but this may not extend to their subjective
   liking of the material, as measured by student evaluations. Furthermore,
   the effect of the change in the teaching methodology was not replicated
   when changing the teaching team.},

Title = {Is the Flipped Classroom Method Useful for Teaching Project Management?},
Journal = {PROJECT MANAGEMENT RESEARCH AND PRACTICE},
Year = {2018},
Volume = {5},
Month = {JAN-DEC},
Abstract = {A teaching method known as the flipped classroom has become increasingly
   popular in recent years, and the method is now widely used around the
   world at all levels of the education system. This paper seeks to examine
   and elucidate the concept of the flipped classroom method as well as
   scrutinize its varying manifestations within educational settings,
   focusing particularly on the question of whether the teaching method is
   a fruitful teaching strategy for project management. Data gathering was
   based on an analysis of research literature focusing on the application
   of the flipped classroom as well as interviews conducted with both
   teachers and students associated with a master's degree program in
   project management at Reykjavik University. The interviews sought to
   extract perspectives of both teachers and students concerning their
   experiences of the flipped classroom method in contrast to conventional
   teaching methods. Finally, the paper will present the findings from an
   analysis comparing test results from an international certification
   examination in project management for two groups of students. One group
   attended lessons where the flipped classroom method was applied whereas
   the other group was instructed using traditional teaching methods.
   The findings of the study reveal that the flipped classroom method is a
   fruitful and relevant strategy for teaching and learning project
   management. The findings show that the students were more positive
   toward the method than the teachers. Furthermore, the students were
   generally more receptive to new teaching methods than the teachers were.
   60\% of the students who attended lessons that used the flipped
   classroom claimed that it had aided them in preparing for the
   certification examination.},

Abstract = {This paper aims to examine the current dynamics of the flipped classroom
   studies and to propose a direction for future research for the field.
   Using a bibliometric approach, we observe a sample of 1557 documents
   from the Scopus database to identify research activity on the flipped
   classroom. The keywords ``flipped classroom{''} and ``flipped
   learning{''} have been executed in the search query. We presented the
   earlier stage of research in the flipped classroom, the subsequent
   trends, publications status based on source title, country and
   institution and examined citations pattern of the publication. We also
   discuss the themes based on the occurrences and terms of the keywords,
   title and abstract of the documents. This paper also predicts the future
   study in the flipped classroom using Lotka's law. We found that the
   pattern distribution of the author's contribution fits with the law. We
   conclude by suggesting a few potential research directions on the
   flipped classroom. Research on flipped classroom focuses on approaches,
   strategies and effectiveness perceived by practitioners and learners
   with relatively less attention on author's contribution and the
   prediction on their future and sustainable contribution and networking
   in guaranteeing the survival and expansion of flipped classroom approach
   for the coming decades.},

Title = {The Study of Flipped-Classroom for Pre-Service Science Teachers},
Journal = {EDUCATION SCIENCES},
Year = {2018},
Volume = {8},
Number = {4},
Month = {DEC},
Abstract = {The relatively new methodology, flipped-classroom, is one of blended
   learning instruction methodologies in which the traditional-classroom is
   inverted. This methodology asserts that students can participate and
   engage more successfully in their class and can attain better learning
   when their classroom is flipped. This work presents a two-year study to
   measure the effects of the flipped-classroom model on the performance,
   perceptions, and emotions for teacher training students in science
   education. Particularly, this research was carried out during two
   courses, 2014/2015 and 2015/2016, in a general science subject. With a
   post-task questionnaire, we obtained the information to assess their
   performance, perceptions, and emotions, toward the class. The results
   confirmed that a statistically significant difference was found on all
   assessments with the flipped-classroom students, performing higher on
   average, showing favorable perceptions, and demonstrating positive
   emotions about the flipped-classroom model. Thus, the students were
   ready to take more courses pursuing a flipped-classroom model. The
   results achieved in this study show a promising inclination about the
   performance, perceptions, and emotions of students toward the
   flipped-classroom methodology, and will provide an entirely a new
   impetus for this relatively new instruction methodology.},

Abstract = {Introduction There is a pressing need to explore strategies which adopt
   and incorporate contemporary teaching methods to keep abreast with
   technological advances. Flipped classroom is a type of blended learning
   approach that has received considerable attention as an alternative to
   traditional lectures. The purpose of this scoping review is to explore
   the characteristics of the flipped classroom model implemented in
   undergraduate dental education. Materials and Methods The scoping review
   has been reported under the PRISMA extension for scoping review
   guidelines. Systematic search of databases culminated in full-text
   papers that were evaluated for quality. Results A systematic search on
   flipped classroom in dental education identified a total of 30 papers
   for full-text evaluation. After further exclusion, 17 studies were
   selected for data charting. Discussion The student satisfaction,
   learning resources, pre-class and/or in-class activities, and academic
   scores are analysed and discussed. Conclusion Flipped classroom improves
   student satisfaction in majority of the studies, whilst its effect on
   academic scores, particularly for skill development, needs more
   research.},

Abstract = {The ultimate goal of English teaching is to cultivate students with
   strong language application ability. The traditional mode of teaching
   and learning in College English classroom can no longer meet the
   requirements of College English teaching reform. Cooperative learning
   model can help teachers eliminate the disadvantages of traditional
   English teaching and provide students with an open and free space, which
   is in good agreement with the flipped classroom teaching model. The
   flipped classroom teaching mode based on cooperative learning can
   improve students' autonomous learning ability and communication ability,
   and it also can cultivate their innovative thinking and team spirit. In
   this paper we conduct an empirical study on the influencing factors of
   teaching satisfaction, the relationship between learning behavior
   engagement and academic achievement under the flipped classroom teaching
   mode based on cooperative learning. It proves that the application of
   cooperative learning model in College English flipped classroom will
   bring a more efficient classroom to teachers and students.},

Abstract = {Background and Context: Flipped classrooms are becoming more widely
   adopted across engineering higher education contexts. In degree programs
   where enrollment is increasing and undergraduate curricula are packed
   with content, pedagogies that allow more time for actively participate
   in classroom activities are being highly sought after to aid in
   increases in retention and persistence.
   Objective: The following study analyzed the impact of a flipped
   classroom intervention in a numerical analysis course teaching MATLAB
   programming taught to students not majoring in a computer-related
   engineering discipline.
   Method: Performance in the flipped classroom was compared to historical
   performance in the traditional classroom. Participants? intrinsic
   motivation was also investigated to try to understand the difference
   seen between semester offerings of the course.
   Findings: Student performance improved among students participating in
   the flipped classroom approach. Intrinsic motivation did not impact
   performance in the flipped classroom.
   Implications: Our work provides further evidence of the efficacy of
   flipped classroom approaches for teaching introductory programming. This
   work also highlights the importance of considering incoming knowledge
   and maturity when selecting flipped classrooms for educational contexts.},

Abstract = {The purpose of this qualitative study is to document the experiences of
   students who participated in a flipped classroom during a Grade 11
   Modern World History and a Grade 11 Biology course. An abridged
   literature review revealed the flipped classroom provides enriched
   opportunities for collaborative learning and for greater teacher-student
   interaction; however, during the homework phase, some students are not
   equipped to be independent learners. For this action research project,
   we collected data from 48 students who completed three sets of
   qualitative questionnaires and participated in two focus groups.
   Augmented data included excerpts from reflective journals maintained by
   the flipped classroom teachers. From the data, three dominant themes
   surfaced. First, the flipped classroom promoted active learning. Second,
   it supported stronger relationships among students and their teachers.
   Third, it activated a steep learning curve. Details of 21st century
   learning are used to conceptualize the findings. One implication of the
   study is that, at the start of the flipped experience, teachers need to
   communicate fluidly to students what the flipped classroom is and is
   not.},

Abstract = {Active teaching approaches such as the flipped classroom are linked to
   better quality student learning outcomes across health care disciplines,
   with the potential to support students' preparedness for practice. In
   the flipped classroom instructional approach, students engage in
   significant pre-class preparation to learn foundational knowledge and
   skills, then undertake instructional activities in the classroom that
   require them to integrate, apply and extend their learning to new
   contexts. This study reports the results of a multinational survey of
   flipped classroom use in veterinary education. Participants' (n = 165)
   familiarity with and extent of use of the flipped classroom technique
   were investigated, together with the teaching strategies used and the
   perceived benefits and barriers to implementation. Relationships between
   respondent characteristics and flipped classroom use were also explored.
   The results indicated that 95\% of participants were familiar with the
   flipped classroom technique, although fewer (64\%) used it in their
   teaching. Pre-class activities included reviewing online and printed
   material, and engaging in preparatory learning activities such as
   quizzes, case analyses, reflective assignments and group activities. A
   variety of active learning strategies were used in class, including
   discussions, presentations, quizzes, group activities, problem solving
   and laboratory/practical exercises. Most participants perceived that the
   flipped classroom technique benefited student learning, with some also
   identifying benefits for the faculty involved. A range of student-,
   faculty- and institution-related barriers to implementing the flipped
   classroom technique were identified. These barriers need to be
   considered and addressed by teachers and administrators seeking to
   improve students' preparedness for practice by implementing flipped
   classrooms in veterinary education.},

Title = {Evaluation of a flipped classroom approach to learning introductory
   epidemiology},
Journal = {BMC MEDICAL EDUCATION},
Year = {2018},
Volume = {18},
Month = {APR 2},
Abstract = {Background: Although the flipped classroom model has been widely adopted
   in medical education, reports on its use in graduate-level public health
   programs are limited. This study describes the design, implementation,
   and evaluation of a flipped classroom redesign of an introductory
   epidemiology course and compares it to a traditional model.
   Methods: One hundred fifty Masters-level students enrolled in an
   introductory epidemiology course with a traditional format (in-person
   lecture and discussion section, at-home assignment; 2015, N = 72) and a
   flipped classroom format (at-home lecture, in-person discussion section
   and assignment; 2016, N = 78). Using mixed methods, we compared student
   characteristics, examination scores, and end-of-course evaluations of
   the 2016 flipped classroom format and the 2015 traditional format. Data
   on the flipped classroom format, including pre-and post-course surveys,
   open-ended questions, self-reports of section leader teaching practices,
   and classroom observations, were evaluated.
   Results: There were no statistically significant differences in
   examination scores or students' assessment of the course between 2015
   (traditional) and 2016 (flipped). In 2016, 57.1\% (36) of respondents to
   the end-of-course evaluation found watching video lectures at home to
   have a positive impact on their time management. Open-ended survey
   responses indicated a number of strengths of the flipped classroom
   approach, including the freedom to watch prerecorded lectures at any
   time and the ability of section leaders to clarify targeted concepts.
   Suggestions for improvement focused on ways to increase regular
   interaction with lecturers.
   Conclusions: There was no significant difference in students'
   performance on quantitative assessments comparing the traditional format
   to the flipped classroom format. The flipped format did allow for
   greater flexibility and applied learning opportunities at home and
   during discussion sections.},

Title = {Flipped classroom versus traditional teaching methods within
   musculoskeletal physical therapy: a case report},
Journal = {PHYSIOTHERAPY THEORY AND PRACTICE},
Abstract = {Background and Purpose: The flipped classroom method is a popular way to
   use technology to assist with the delivery of educational experiences.
   Yet there is insufficient information regarding student opinions or
   outcomes about the flipped classroom method within physical therapy. The
   purpose of this case report was to describe student opinions and
   outcomes of the flipped classroom teaching and traditional lecture/lab
   methods of teaching within musculoskeletal physical therapy. Case
   Description: Thirty-six (36) first-year physical therapy students
   enrolled at a regional physical therapy program completed an anonymous
   internet-based survey regarding their impressions of traditional and
   flipped classroom teaching methods. Flipped classroom and traditional
   teaching methods were both used within the same musculoskeletal course.
   The survey was created to aid in planning subsequent courses and asked
   questions about student's preferred teaching method (flipped,
   traditional, or both equal) across a variety of categories. Student
   exams scores, using the same question bank, were compared to the year
   prior as a quantitative outcome measure. Outcomes: Twenty-nine (29)
   students (81\%) completed the survey. Generally, students preferred the
   flipped classroom. Compared to the previous year, test scores for all
   content areas were similar (+/- 4\%) except cervical spine which was
   improved (>10\%). When asked outright, 28/29 students preferred the
   flipped teaching method. Discussion and Conclusion: Student opinions
   indicate the flipped classroom is preferable to traditional methods yet
   objective outcomes appear similar. Physical therapy educators seeking
   ways to improve the student experience using technology in the classroom
   may consider utilizing the flipped classroom method.},

Month = {OCT},
Abstract = {In a digital and interconnected context, where educational processes are
   in constant change, active methodologies take on a relevant role by
   making students the protagonists of their learning. Among the different
   possibilities, the flipped classroom stands out for its time
   optimization, the incorporation of technological resources, and the
   personalization of the processes. The aim of this research is to analyze
   the perception of higher education students about the usefulness of the
   flipped classroom as a methodology. The information was collected with a
   validated instrument, which was applied to a sample of 123 students from
   the Faculty of Educational Sciences of the University of Malaga (Spain).
   A positive evaluation of the usefulness of the flipped classroom as a
   learning methodology was reflected in the results, highlighting its
   instrumental dimension. Significant differences were perceived regarding
   the usefulness of the flipped classroom for the promotion of autonomous
   learning, which had a superior valuation according to women. In
   conclusion, the flipped classroom stands as a methodological alternative
   to promote learning that has a positive evaluation from the students
   that made up the sample.},

Abstract = {With advances in learning technologies, new pedagogical models are being
   developed to improve students' learning performance. One notable model
   is the flipped classroom, which has attracted the attention of many
   researchers, particularly in K-12 education. However, research on
   effective approaches for managing the flipped classroom model to improve
   mathematics learning is lacking. This study explored approaches to
   manage the flipped classroom in a Chinese context and designed an
   approach to improve the mathematical learning performance of middle
   school students. In a flipped classroom teaching and learning, students
   took notes while watching videos at home and then teacher utilized the
   notes for in-class discussion. A total of 88 sixth-grade students in a
   secondary school in mainland China participated in this study. An
   experiment was conducted to evaluate the effectiveness of the proposed
   approach by situating the experimental and control groups in flipped and
   traditional classrooms, respectively. The results show that the proposed
   flipped classroom approach significantly improves the students'
   mathematical learning performance. The proposed approach is more
   beneficial to students at the middle mathematics level comparing to
   those at high or low levels. Furthermore, some suggestions are provided
   for teachers to manage flipped classroom more effectively.},

Abstract = {Introduction: In this study were compared the effects of the
   Conventional Flipped Classroom (virtual component for independent study
   + face-to-face component for the interactive discussion of clinical
   cases) and the Remote Flipped Classroom (FRFC) (virtual component for
   independent study + ``online{''} component for the interactive
   discussion of clinical cases), as a teaching / learning strategy in the
   face of the COVID-19 pandemic, on the self-directed learning of surgical
   students. \textbackslash{}
   Methods: Self-directed learning levels, as a result indicator of the
   change in methodological strategy, were compared in a group of
   undergraduate students participating in a conventional flipped classroom
   in 2017 to those of a group of students participating in a remote
   flipped classroom in 2020, during the surgery course at the Universidad
   de La Sabana, in Chia - Colombia. For this purpose, the Preparedness
   Scale for Self-Directed Learning (EPAD), validated to the Spanish
   language, was used.
   Results: In both groups, the levels of self-directed learning were
   acceptable. No significant effect (positive or negative) of either of
   the two models of flipped classroom was identified on the self-directed
   learning (d Cohen = -0.08; IC95\% -0.42 - 0.24).
   Conclusions: The remote flipped classroom is an alternative to the
   conventional inverted classroom that does not compromise the
   self-directed learning of surgery students.},

Abstract = {Digital learning has become more than just a trend in the modern world.
   Blended learning concepts are well established in different areas of
   application. An important concept in this domain is the so-called
   flipped classroom (FC). This approach repurposes class time to focus on
   application and discussion, while the acquisition of basic knowledge
   will happen at home, enabled by online lectures. In the past, research
   demonstrated and discussed the advantages of flipped classroom concepts
   within case studies. Still, standardized guidelines for the development
   of flipped classrooms are rare. However, it is necessary to learn from
   the past to improve future education. Thus, we analyzed reviews on
   flipped classroom research and used these to inductively develop a
   reference process model for the realization of flipped classroom
   concepts. The model is based on phases taken from project management,
   which help to structure the process and associated tasks. The results
   present the process model shown in Business Process Model and Notation
   (BPMN) and applicable checklists for the development of a FC course. The
   process model was applied and evaluated during the implementation of a
   flipped classroom at a university. Future research should concentrate on
   evaluation of the model as well as a deeper elaboration of upcoming
   roles and their tasks in order to derive further guidance for teachers
   and organizations.},

Abstract = {In recent years, the flipped classroom has been proposed as an
   alternative paradigm of teaching, and has been demonstrated to improve
   the students' knowledge and skills, engagement, and self-efficacy. At
   the same time, as the number of students seeking higher education is
   growing and the needs of these students are rapidly evolving, it has
   become necessary to improve their cognitive holding power and enhance
   equity among them. The goal of this study is to investigate the impact
   of the flipped classroom on improving the students' cognitive holding
   power and enhancing equity.
   For this study, the flipped classroom was implemented for teaching
   undergraduate university students' course ``An Introduction to
   Instructional Technology{''}. In the class, whiteboard and Smartboard
   were used to discuss and clarify ambiguous ideas related to the topic
   and to present the model answers for the tasks. Outside the class, video
   files and Google applications (Word, PPT, Drive) were used for
   delivering learning materials. WhatsApp was used for communication and
   Google form was used for designing learning activities and assessment.
   The results of the study indicate: (1) to some extent flipped classroom
   can be a solution for improving students' cognitive holding power,
   especially in performing learning tasks and following teacher'
   instructions. (2) Equity among the students can be enhanced in the
   flipped classroom. These findings have implications for using the
   flipped classroom in managing the diversity of university students
   through enhancing equity among them and improving their abilities.},

Abstract = {The Flipped Classroom is a teaching model where content attainment is
   shifted forward to outside of class, to be followed up by the teacher in
   class. In Sweden this way of teaching has become very popular during
   recent years. But what is gained by this way of teaching? Research on
   the Flipped Classroom in the context of the Swedish High School system
   is close to non-existent; why studies within this field are of great
   importance.
   In order to find appropriate informants, an electronic survey was
   constructed. Informants matching the selection criteria were then
   selected for qualitative interviews. In total nine informants agreed to
   participate in interviews (Semi-structured) to describe their
   experiences from flipping their own classrooms. The informants reported
   that the transition from more conventional ways of teaching to using the
   Flipped Classroom entailed major changes. The informants pointed out
   that the process of moving away from the more conventional way of
   teaching improved their teaching. All of the informants expressed they
   all used the Flipped Classroom methodology but they all did it with
   different goals in mind and their approach varied a lot. By using the
   same terminology, it might seem that they worked with the Flipped
   Classroom in similar ways, but the results show they did not. Herein
   lies the problem: Teachers say they flip their classrooms, which they
   do, but they do not share the same goals or approaches, just the term:
   The Flipped Classroom.},

Abstract = {The flipped classroom, an approach that extends learning beyond the
   classroom, has been extensively and empirically researched in the
   science and math disciplines. However, whether the flipped classroom is
   feasible in senior high school education-where variation in student
   performance is of particular concern-has yet to be examined. In this
   light, this study set out to verify the feasibility and effectiveness of
   the flipped classroom in high school education, and to compare its
   effects with conventional lecture-based instruction on high school
   students with different levels of foreign language (English) vocabulary
   knowledge. After six weekly sessions, it was found that both methods of
   instruction were effective in promoting vocabulary gains. However, the
   flipped classroom was better able to reduce variation among students in
   a multi-level class. Importantly, although both high and low achievers
   benefited from the flipped classroom instruction and were left with a
   positive attitude toward the additional workload it entailed, the effect
   of the flipped classroom seems to be more manifest in low achievers.
   Based on the above findings and the results of questionnaire data, the
   pedagogical implications are discussed.},

Abstract = {Recent years have brought the need for new pedagogical approaches that
   appeal to the involvement and participation of learners in the learning
   process. One of these approaches is the flipped classroom, which gives
   to learners the possibility to prepare for the next class, through
   pre-recorded video lectures and close-ended problems. Many studies
   merely replace in-class instructions by videos and use class time for
   group discussions. Nevertheless, what instructional design framework
   should we use in planning the overall flipped classroom approach? This
   paper attempts to answer this question through exploratory studies
   conducted in Algeria University. The purpose of this case study was to
   explore English education learners' experiences of digital storytelling
   through a flipped classroom approach.},

Abstract = {Novice students encountered many difficulties and challenges when
   learning to program. They face problems in terms of high cognitive load
   in learning and lack of prior programming knowledge. Various strategies
   and approaches are implemented to overcome the difficulties and
   challenges in programming. A flipped classroom is an active learning
   strategy implemented in many subjects and courses, including
   programming. The flipped classroom strategy consists of three phases,
   namely, pre-class, in-class, and post-class. A focus group discussion is
   conducted involving 13 participants from various learning institutions.
   The purpose of the study is to discuss the implementation of flipped
   classroom strategy in programming. The study also identifies a technique
   for monitoring students' involvement in activities outside the classroom
   and proper motivation to engage students in programming. Related
   research questions are constructed as guidelines for the discussion. The
   deductive thematic analysis is performed on the transcripts of the
   discussion. As a result, four pre-determine codes and two codes were
   generated from the analysis. This study identifies suitable activities,
   tools, monitoring strategies, and motivation to support the
   implementation of a flipped classroom in programming. There is good
   potential through flipped classrooms in learning programming with a
   systematic and careful planned implementation.},

Abstract = {The present study aimed to examine the impact of the flipped classroom
   on the development of the Arabic speaking skills of the seventh-grade
   students. In addition, the study sought to examine students' perceptions
   of learning via the flipped classroom. The sample consisted of 148
   students who were chosen by using the convenience sampling method and
   were distributed randomly into a control group and an experimental
   group. The control group was taught using the traditional teaching
   method, while the experimental group was taught by the flipped classroom
   approach. A speaking test and semi-structured focus group interviews
   were employed. Results revealed that there was a statistically
   significant difference in the Arabic speaking skills performance between
   the two groups, in favor of the experimental group. Findings also showed
   that among the experimental group, there was a statistically significant
   difference in the speaking skills performance, ascribed to gender, in
   favor of female students. Furthermore, the study found that the students
   held positive perceptions of the flipped classroom.},

Abstract = {The aim of this study was to assess whether a flipped classroom was an
   effective model for dental students to learn periodontal diagnosis and
   treatment planning (DTP). Participants were all third-year students in
   three academic years (2015-17) at Harvard School of Dental Medicine: two
   groups that experienced the flipped classroom (Classes of 2017 and
   2018), and a control group (Class of 2019) that received the same
   content in traditional lecture format. All three groups completed a DTP
   knowledge quiz before and after the educational experience; the flipped
   classroom groups also completed pre and post surveys of their opinions
   about flipped classrooms. The flipped classroom group received a
   23-minute video and corresponding PowerPoint presentation to view on
   their own time. In class, these students were divided into groups to
   diagnosis and treatment plan cases and discuss them with the instructor.
   Of 71 students in the two flipped classroom groups, 69 pre and post
   quizzes were returned (response rate 97\%), and 61 pre and post surveys
   were returned (response rate 86\%). Of 35 students in the lecture group,
   34 completed pre and post quizzes (response rate 97\%). The mean pre
   scores on the knowledge quiz in the flipped classroom groups and the
   conventional lecture group were 64\% and 54\%, respectively. After the
   DTP education, students' quiz scores improved in all three groups, but
   only the difference in the flipped classroom groups was statistically
   significant (p<0.01). After the flipped classroom session, 84\% of the
   students agreed or strongly agreed that this methodology was effective
   for learning periodontal DTP, and 90\% agreed or strongly agreed they
   understood the fundamentals of periodontal DTP both increases over their
   pre survey scores. Overall, this flipped classroom model was effective
   in educating students on periodontal DTP and was well received by the
   students.},

Journal = {FRONTIERS IN PSYCHOLOGY},
Year = {2020},
Volume = {11},
Month = {JUN 3},
Abstract = {In the flipped classroom method, which is accepted as one of the blended
   learning approaches, the traditional teaching process takes place
   outside of the classroom through videos. Activities, projects, and
   homework related to upper-level cognitive field steps are carried out
   during classroom time. Research and interest in the flipped classroom
   are increasing steadily. Employing a cooperative learning method is
   suggested for using class time in the flipped classroom method. However,
   there has not been sufficient research on the implemented results of
   those suggestions. Moreover, there is no clear roadmap on how to
   incorporate cooperative learning methods into the flipped classroom.
   This research reviews theoretical infrastructures of flipped classroom
   and cooperative learning methods according to the Vygotsky theory and
   makes various suggestions for implementation and implementers.},

Abstract = {In a flipped classroom, an increasingly popular pedagogical model,
   students view a video lecture at home and work on exercises with the
   instructor during class time. Advocates of the flipped classroom claim
   the practice not only improves student achievement but also ameliorates
   the achievement gap. We conduct a randomized controlled trial at West
   Point and find the flipped classroom produced short-term gains in math
   and no effect in economics. The flipped model broadened the achievement
   gap: Effects are driven by white, male, and higher-achieving students.
   We find no long-term average effects on student learning but the widened
   achievement gap persists. Our findings demonstrate feasibility for the
   flipped classroom to induce short-term gains in student learning;
   however, the exacerbation of the achievement gap, the effect fade-out,
   and the null effects in economics, suggest that educators should
   exercise caution when considering the model.},

Abstract = {Nowadays, the ``flipped classroom{''} approach is taking the center
   stage within medical education. However, very few reports on the
   implementation of the flipped classroom in neurology have been published
   to date, and this educational model still represents a challenge for
   students and educators alike. In this article, neurology educators from
   the American Academy of Neurology's A. B. Baker Section on Neurological
   Education analyze reports of flipped classroom in other medical/surgical
   subspecialties, review the current implementation in neurology, and
   discuss future strategies to flip the neurology curriculum through
   contextualization of the benefits and the consequences. ANN NEUROL 2019},

Abstract = {In recent years, educational research has focused on analyzing
   significant differences in the academic performance of university
   students according to the intervention model of the traditional
   methodology vs. the flipped classroom. This empirical-analytical
   research is based on a quasi-experimental design with non-equivalent
   groups. The results reveal significant differences on the average grades
   of university students; those participating in the flipped classroom
   obtained higher scores than students following a traditional
   methodology, regardless of the specialization. Moreover, this research
   concludes that the flipped classroom approach offers an opportunity to
   transform the traditional system by improving the classroom environment,
   the teaching-learning process and the student's assessment.},

Abstract = {The flipped classroom technique has been applied to a part ({''}Strength
   of Materials{''}) of a second-year compulsory course called ``Technology
   of Materials.{''} Due to the number of students, the course is divided
   into two groups - one taught with the traditional methodology (98
   students), and the other taught with the flipped one (97 students). In
   the traditional methodology, the teacher explains the lesson and solves
   the problems, with students as passive actors in the learning process.
   In the developed flipped classroom model, the students have edited
   videos on an institutional online platform, available before each
   face-to-face session. In addition, a linked activity is used to check
   the students' knowledge before class. The in-class time is dedicated to
   briefly reviewing the concepts explained in the video, with a special
   emphasis on the errors detected in the link activity, followed by groups
   of students solving problems. The aim of this study is to present
   quantitative results of the effect of the flipped classroom in
   engineering with a focus on the gender of the students. The results show
   that the flipped classroom model has a direct impact on student grades,
   especially for female students, which presents significant differences
   when compared with males of the same group. In addition, the grade
   standard deviation values were lower, ensuring a better general level.
   The students of the flipped classroom group also attended the exams in a
   higher ratio than others, as these students are likely to feel more
   confident in the knowledge they have acquired.},

Abstract = {Emerging technologies and mobile devices have enabled improved quality
   of learning outcomes in the field of language learning. With the
   opportunities provided by innovative, emerging tools, traditional ways
   of learning have been enhanced. The flipped classroom is one of the
   innovative learning models that have appeared in language learning in
   the last decade. The current study was carried out to investigate the
   difference that the flipped classroom made on students' self-efficacy
   and gender. 58 participants with an intermediate proficiency level in
   English were randomly assigned to one of two conditions: experimental
   (flipped classroom) and control (traditional) group. The participants
   employed the Self-Efficacy Survey before and after the intervention of
   flipped classroom. The results demonstrated a significant increase in
   self-efficacy scores of the experimental group. When gender was analyzed
   separately, the females in the experimental group were found to have
   greater improvements in self-efficacy than their male colleagues in the
   experimental group when utilizing the flipped classroom practice. In the
   light of the results, students, especially female students can increase
   their individual confidence in producing specific or requested
   performance in language learning while engaged in the flipped classroom.},

Month = {FEB},
Abstract = {The purpose of this mixed-methods study was to investigate the
   influential factors of student satisfaction with online digital
   audio-visual flipped classroom learning. A total of 103 students
   enrolling in the two-credit compulsory code course participated in this
   flipped classroom research. Descriptive data analysis and grey
   relational analysis demonstrated that student respondents were most
   satisfied with repeated practice (1st), followed immediately by peer
   learning (2nd), and active learning (3rd). In terms of qualitative data,
   three themes emerged from the focus group analysis, including: improving
   independent learning, enhancing peer learning, and increasing
   teacher-student interaction. The flipped classroom model provided
   opportunities for students to strengthen their self-directed learning
   capabilities, improved students' learning motivation, and to be a team
   player among third-year nursing students. The results were consistent
   with the actual circumstance. The results integrated descriptive data,
   the mathematic model, and interviews to validate the accuracy and
   rationality of the data. According to this study, an online digital
   audio-visual flipped classroom could improve student independent
   learning and enhance peer communication. The results provide an accurate
   assessment tool suitable for Taiwanese nursing students' flipped
   classroom model learning experience.},

Abstract = {Background
   The effects of the flipped classroom have been demonstrated in various
   fields of education in recent years. Training in emergency medicine is
   also beginning to gradually implement the flipped classroom; however,
   its practical effect in emergency medicine contexts is not yet clear.
   Objective
   The present study investigates the effects of the flipped classroom on
   advanced cardiopulmonary life support (ACLS) training implemented among
   practicum students in emergency medicine.
   Methods
   The study randomly assigned into control and experimental conditions 108
   fourth year students in the College of Medicine at Yonsei University, in
   Seoul, who were scheduled to take clinical practice in emergency
   medicine between March and July 2017. Students were taught about ACLS in
   either a traditional lecture-based classroom (control condition) or a
   flipped classroom (experimental condition); then, simulation training
   with ACLS scenarios was carried out. Finally, each student was rated on
   performance using a rating form developed in advance.
   Results
   ACLS simulation scores of the students in the flipped classroom were
   70.9 +/- 10.9, which was higher than those of the students in the
   traditional classroom (67.1 +/- 11.3); however, this difference was not
   statistically significant (p = 0.339). In addition, the difference in
   student satisfaction as measured on a survey was statistically
   insignificant (p = 0.655).
   Conclusions
   Competency assessment after simulation-based training in ACLS undergone
   by senior medical students randomly assigned to flipped and traditional
   classrooms showed no statistical difference in competency between the
   two groups.},

Abstract = {Clinical skills laboratory (CSL) training was recently introduced in the
   renewed veterinary curriculum at Ghent University, using models and
   simulators for teaching practical skills. However, time in the CSL is
   restricted due to the large number of students combined with limited
   availability of personnel. Therefore, a flipped classroom (FC) model was
   introduced to maximize learning experiences.The goal of the present
   study was to evaluate the effect of flipped classroom CSL training on
   students' self-efficacy and practical surgical skills. Flipped classroom
   CSL training was implemented for the third-year pre-clinical students (n
   = 196) in the 6-year veterinary medicine program. Prior to CSL sessions,
   students studied online `learning paths', including text, pictures,
   videos of the skills, links to background information, a forum, and a
   compulsory pre-class quiz. A pre- and post-test were administered before
   and after flipped classroom CSL training.The tests consisted of a
   self-efficacy scale consisting of 20 items and an objective structured
   clinical examination (OSCE) test of surgical skills performance. Flipped
   classroom CSL training resulted in significantly higher self-efficacy
   (score/100, pre-test 55 +/- 14 vs. post-test 83 +/- 8, p< .001) and
   surgical skills performance (score/20, pre-test 5 +/- 3 vs. post-test 17
   +/- 3, p< .001). In conclusion, this study demonstrated the feasibility
   and value of implementing a flipped classroom approach in combination
   with CSL training.},

Abstract = {The flipped classroom method has gained popularity in recent years with
   the idea that it is possible to use the time spent in classrooms more
   effectively by simply flipping the passive lecturing parts with the
   homework exercises. Accordingly, this article investigates the
   effectiveness of the flipped classroom in teaching grammar to EFL
   learners. A study was conducted with the participants of two English
   courses in a vocational school in Turkey. Results indicated that the
   flipped group achieved higher scores than the non-flipped group and that
   the difference between two groups was statistically significant. Hence,
   the factors that lie beneath this improvement are likely to be
   attributed to the teaching method, which is also supported by the
   answers given to a flipped classroom perception survey and a focus group
   interview.},

Abstract = {This research aims to design a curriculum in the flipped classroom in
   elementary math courses based on the synthesis research method. The
   statistical population included all valid scientific papers regarding
   the flipped classroom. A total of 120 scientific papers were identified
   based on inclusion criteria, and finally, 60 research papers were
   selected based on exclusion criteria for final analysis. A
   researcher-made worksheet was used to collect, report, and record the
   information of the initial research. Findings were analyzed using
   Marsh's seven-step model of synthesis research and open and axial coding
   methods. The results indicated that the flipped classroom in an
   elementary math course is a student-centered program that creates
   different roles and responsibilities for the learner, teacher, and
   knowledge.},

Title = {The flipped classroom: a novel approach to physical examination skills
   for osteopathic medical students},
Journal = {JOURNAL OF OSTEOPATHIC MEDICINE},
Year = {2021},
Volume = {121},

Abstract = {Context: Medical students are faced with the challenge of synthesizing
   large volumes of information quickly. With the increasing accessibility
   of technology, a ``flipped classroom{''} allows students to learn
   foundational material independently. Class time is instead devoted to
   in-depth skill building with instructors, promoting an active learning
   environment. This method of content delivery is also relevant given the
   current COVID-19 pandemic.
   Objectives: To comprehensively evaluate the benefit of adopting a
   flipped classroom approach in teaching physical exam skills (PES) to
   first-year osteopathic medical students.
   Methods: A cohort study was conducted comparing first-year osteopathic
   students in the class of 2022 (n=201), who had taken the PES course
   traditionally, with the class of 2023 (n=203), who experienced the
   flipped classroom approach. Objective metrics such as cumulative grades,
   objective structural clinical examination performance (OSCE), and
   practical exam performance were compared using nonparametric
   Mann-Whitney U rank sum tests. Subjective measures such as student
   course evaluations were used to analyze course perceptions using
   independent sample t-tests assuming unequal variances. A faculty survey
   was administered to faculty who taught both cohorts to assess instructor
   attitudes toward the flipped classroom approach. Due to the COVID-19
   pandemic, Spring 2020 quarter data was not included, given the
   transition of all classes to an online learning environment.
   Results: The flipped classroom approach significantly improved objective
   student performance for the Fall (p=0.009) and Winter (p<0.001) student
   cumulative grades and the History-Taking OSCE (p=0.010). Performance on
   Fall and Winter practical exam scores had no significant association
   with the flipped classroom. General student perceptions of the course
   remained unchanged between both cohorts. Faculty survey results from 10
   faculty members showed that six (60\%) faculty members preferred the
   traditional classroom, while four (40\%) preferred the flipped
   classroom.
   Conclusions: The flipped classroom approach showed some statistically
   significant improvement in student PES. Further studies are needed to
   evaluate the benefits of a flipped classroom approach using skills-based
   assessments styles to measure student performance, with a focus on
   standardization of in-classroom groupwork.},

Abstract = {The English proficiency of Chinese college students is mainly
   constrained by their low interest in English learning. The English
   educators in Chinese colleges must improve the initiative of their
   students to learn English. This paper attempts to create a college
   English teaching platform based on computer networking technology.
   Taking flipped classroom as the theoretical basis of college English
   education, the author introduced the concept and development of flipped
   classroom, and verified the feasibility of applying the theory in
   English teaching. To provide the media for flipped classroom, a college
   English teaching platform was built on the browser/server (B/S)
   structure, and used to promote the information-based English teaching in
   colleges. The functional modules and main interfaces of the platform
   were illustrated one by one. The flipped classroom-based B/S teaching
   platform was adopted for one semester by a college in Hunan Province.
   The class using this platform was taken as the test group, and another
   class without using the platform as the control group. The English
   scores of the two groups were compared, confirming the effectiveness of
   the proposed platform. Our research demonstrates the value of flipped
   classroom, and the proposed teaching platform helps improve the
   efficiency of college English teaching.},

Abstract = {More than twenty years have passed since the term Flipped Classroom was
   coined. Despite of the increasing interest in this teaching methodology,
   fields like Computer Science still need more research in order to judge
   the impact of this methodology in the learning process. This work
   presents a comparative study between traditional lectures and a partial
   application of the Flipped Classroom methodology in the subject Language
   Processors of a Computer Science degree. The study involved 158 students
   during two weeks and focused on practical contents of the subject. The
   results show that students in the Flipped Classroom group were more
   responsible of their learning process, consequently they got significant
   better learning outcomes either during or at the end of the learning
   process. Students' satisfaction was highly positive as well. This work
   increases the amount of experiments about Flipped Classroom within the
   field of Computer Science. In addition, this work serves as an example
   of how to begin the transition from traditional lectures to the Flipped
   Classroom methodology.},

Abstract = {The purpose of this case study was to explore prospective English
   education teachers' (PEET) experiences of digital storytelling (DST)
   through a flipped classroom approach. 36 prospective teachers who
   enrolled in a computer literacy course participated in the study. The
   data was collected through a demographic questionnaire, three open-ended
   questionnaires, and a semi-structured interview form. Four videos were
   prepared to give theoretical input in line with the DST phases described
   by Robin and presented asynchronously via Edmodo system. The results
   showed that PEETs described the DST process through a flipped classroom
   approach. described as entertaining, challenging, and instructive.
   Moreover, according to the results, PEETs learnt specific strategies
   about DST, were inspired, and had the opportunity to check their product
   quality, thanks to the flipped classroom approach. These results
   revealed insights about the design of a flipped classroom approach and
   the DST process.},

Abstract = {In a flipped classroom, students complete automated modules to replace a
   traditional lecture, allowing the time devoted for the lecture to be
   devoted to constructive tasks reinforcing student knowledge. Yet
   although the flipped classroom offers a compelling approach for
   fostering a constructivist, student-centric learning environment,
   research on the efficacy of flipped classes has been mixed. For that
   matter, is it possible to successfully flip a classroom in an advanced,
   heavily specialized course like a bioinformatics algorithms course? Over
   the past several years, the author has implemented a flipped version of
   such a course and will discuss some of the successes and pitfalls

Title = {Assess the feasibility of flipped classroom pedagogy in undergraduate
   nursing education in Sri Lanka: A mixed-methods study},
Journal = {PLOS ONE},
Year = {2021},
Volume = {16},
Number = {11},
Month = {NOV 5},
Abstract = {Background
   The nursing education system has evolved with an increased emphasis on
   student-centred education, such as implementing flipped classroom
   pedagogy. Given the promising positive educational outcomes, the trend
   of using flipped classroom pedagogy has become increasingly popular in
   undergraduate nursing education. However, little is known about how
   these flipped classroom methods impact on nursing educational practices
   in limited-resource settings situated in South Asia.
   Objective
   To assess the feasibility of implementing flipped classroom pedagogy in
   undergraduate nursing education from the nursing students' perspective.
   Methods
   This mixed-methods study employed a quantitative survey and six focus
   group discussions conducted in three state universities in Sri Lanka.
   The Nursing Students' Readiness for Flipped Classroom (NSR-FC)
   questionnaire was used to collect quantitative data. The semi-structured
   focus group discussions were conducted by using 18 reflective and
   open-ended questions. Descriptive statistics and multivariate analysis
   of variance methods were employed when analysing quantitative data. An
   inductive thematic analysis approach was used to summarize the focus
   group discussions.
   Results
   The questionnaire survey revealed that nursing students reported high
   levels of personal, technical, and pedagogical readiness across all
   three universities, while environmental readiness was perceived as low.
   The inductive thematic analysis identified three themes, namely:
   enablers, challenges, and benefits. Specifically, nursing students
   valued the student-centred approach. They were ready to utilize their
   own devices to overcome limited technological provision; however, a
   short training session about how to engage in the flipped classroom was
   desirable. Also, their exposure to basic educational technology was
   perceived as adequate and they were aware of the positive outcomes of
   flipped classroom pedagogy.
   Conclusion
   Nursing students were ready to enrol in a flipped classroom programme.
   The provision of technological resources in the education environment
   was identified as a great challenge for flipped classroom
   implementation. Overall, the findings indicate there are promising
   feasibilities for the flipped classroom implementation.},

Abstract = {Higher education faces several challenges including both increased
   student diversity and the use of technologies. The flipped classroom
   approach has been proposed as a way to address some of these challenges.
   This study examined the effects of a flipped classroom trial conducted
   during a Master's course at the Vrije Universiteit Amsterdam in the
   Netherlands. Half of the course was taught in a traditional lecture
   style while the remaining half was replaced by flipped classrooms.
   Interviews and focus-group discussions were conducted with the students
   to gather information about their experiences of the flipped classroom.
   Questionnaires completed by the students, as well as an interview with
   the tutor, were used to gain further insights into the effects of the
   flipped classroom on learning processes, such as pre-class preparation
   and in-class activities. Findings highlight the success of this trial
   based on the positive feedback from both students and the tutor. In
   particular, the combination of personalised pre-class learning and
   peer-learning classroom activities facilitated deeper learning.
   Surprisingly, even though the overall experience was good, not all
   students agreed that the flipped classroom contributed to positive
   learning outcomes, which should be investigated further because such
   outcomes could differ depending on students' general learning styles and
   preferences. Moreover, in order to facilitate flipped classrooms on a
   larger scale, considerable institutional support is required to enable
   their practical implementation and to provide flexible assessments. Our
   study thus sheds light on the feasibility of implementing flipped
   classroom teaching in higher education.},

Title = {Flipped Classroom for Motor Skills: What Factors Influence College
   Students' Learning Effect?},
Journal = {WIRELESS COMMUNICATIONS \& MOBILE COMPUTING},
Year = {2021},
Volume = {2021},
Month = {AUG 19},
Abstract = {The study of motor skills is an essential course item for college
   students. Many college teachers try to introduce the flipped classroom
   mode into the teaching of motor skills. However, the influence of this
   mode on the learning effect of college students' motor skills is
   uncertain. This paper builds a research model on the basis of literature
   review. This model is used to analyze the influence factors of flipped
   classroom on the learning effect of college students' motor skills.
   Through questionnaire survey and empirical analysis, we verified the
   research hypothesis of each factor. The results show that video
   technical action display, video feedback of students' technical action,
   and teaching interaction have a significant positive impact on the
   learning effect of college students' motor skills in the flipped
   classroom, while video theory teaching has no significant impact. This
   study expands the application of flipped classroom in the field of motor
   skills and enriches the relevant literature of flipped classroom mode.
   Based on the findings of this study, we make the following
   recommendations: (1) teachers can use the way of video recording to
   display technical actions of motor skills, (2) students can use video
   feedback to communicate with the teacher about the learning of motor
   skills, and (3) flipped classroom needs to pay attention to the teaching
   interaction between teachers and students.},

Abstract = {Purpose This paper aims to study the effects of digital flipped
   classroom teaching method integrated cooperative learning model on
   learning motivation and outcome. From the perspective of promoting
   students' learning engagement, this study puts forward suggestions for
   the effective implementation of flipped classroom teaching, so as to
   provide reference for the implementation of flipped classroom teaching
   practice in colleges and universities. Along with the time change and
   promotion of 12-year compulsory education, traditional didactic
   instruction can no longer satisfy all students. The reform wave in
   education is therefore emerged in past years, where the ``flipped
   classroom{''} model strikes a chord and becomes a trend.
   Design/methodology/approach By applying nonequivalent pretest posttest
   control group design to the experimental research, 242 college students
   in Henan Province are selected as subjects of study. They are divided
   into four groups. The first group adopts the flip classroom teaching
   method. The second group adopts the cooperative teaching method. The
   third group adopts the flipping classroom teaching method integrated the
   cooperative teaching method. The fourth group (control group) adopts the
   traditional teaching method. The study lasted 15 weeks with sessions
   carried out 3 h a week. Findings The research results show significant
   effects of flipped classroom teaching method on learning motivation,
   flipped classroom teaching method on learning outcome, cooperative
   learning on learning motivation, cooperative learning on learning
   outcome, flipped classroom teaching method integrated cooperative
   learning on the promotion of learning motivation and flipped classroom
   teaching method integrated cooperative learning on the promotion of
   learning outcome.
   Originality/value Based on the integrated design of flipped classroom
   before, during and after class, this research systematically explores
   the role of flipped classroom in cultivating students' autonomous
   learning ability in the teaching of information science and technology,
   and studies how to maximize the role of flipped classroom in teaching to
   promote and help students' learning. In addition, a special iterative
   method is adopted. In each round of research, according to the opinions
   of students and peers, the inadequacies and improvements in the last
   round of research is found, certain links are increased or decreased,
   and finally the research goals are achieved.},

Abstract = {Students nowadays are hard to be motivated to solve logical problems
   with traditional teaching methods. Computers, Smartphone's, tablets and
   other smart devices disturb their attention. But those smart devices can
   be used as auxiliary tools of modern teaching methods. The flipped
   classroom is one such innovative method that moves the solving problems
   outside the classroom via technology and reinforces solving problems
   inside the classroom via learning activities.
   In this paper, the authors implement flipped classroom as an element of
   Internet of Things (JOT) into learning process of mathematical logic

   was used to help students work with the problems in the course outside
   the classroom. This study showed that perceived usefulness,

Abstract = {The recent movement to integrate the flipped classroom model into higher
   education has resulted in significant changes that affected both
   teaching and learning practices in different ways. After almost a decade
   of research on the flipped classroom model, different emergent outcomes
   have been reported in a domain specific context. To gain a comprehensive
   understanding of the flipped classroom implementation in a university
   context, a review of the literature on the use of flipped classroom in a
   university context was conducted. This study was guided by interpreting
   the previous research findings according to the domain of utilization,
   opportunities, challenges, and extensions to the conventional flipped
   classroom model. This study found that the utilization of flipped
   classroom in various disciplines is mainly advocated to promote
   students' engagement, metacognition, attitude, performance,
   understanding, and achievement, as well as other learning outcomes. The
   key challenges of this method, shared across all disciplines, were
   devoted to the length of the video/digital materials and time required
   for instructors to prepare the learning materials and for students to
   master it. Recommendations for policy makers and other crucial insights
   for the future studies were highlighted.},

Title = {Meta-analyses of flipped classroom studies: A review of methodology},
Journal = {EDUCATIONAL RESEARCH REVIEW},
Year = {2021},
Volume = {33},
Month = {JUN},
Abstract = {The use of meta-analyses has become increasingly widespread in flipped
   classroom research. They are typically seen as a more objective and
   credible method of summarizing the effects of the flipped classroom
   approach. However, problems among meta-analyses are long-standing and
   widespread, and can undermine the credibility of the results. This paper
   has two major objectives: (a) to examine the methodological features of
   the meta-analyses, and (b) to discuss the key methodological concerns of
   the meta-analyses. Nineteen flipped classroom meta-analyses were
   analyzed in this study, which included more than 495 unique primary
   studies, involving more than 72,200 flipped and 77,100 non-flipped
   participants. Given that at least 19 meta-analyses of the flipped
   classroom approach have been conducted so far, a critical appraisal of
   these meta-analyses is both important and timely because it will allow
   practitioners to evaluate the trustworthiness of the findings. The
   results of these meta-analyses suggest the mean effect sizes for
   cognitive outcomes (0.19-1.13), behavioral outcomes (1.40-3.12), and
   perceptual outcomes (0.05-1.62) vary from weak to strong support of
   flipped learning. However, some key methodological elements - searching
   for reference lists and grey literature, assessing the risk of bias in
   primary studies, non-independence of effect sizes, control for student
   initial differences, control for instructor equivalence, and assessing
   publication bias - were inadequately conducted or reported in the
   flipped classroom meta-analyses. There is positive empirical evidence
   for the flipped classroom, but there is also reason to question how this
   evidence has been synthesized.},

Title = {The Effectiveness of Flipped Classroom in Health Professions Education
   in China: A Systematic Review},
Journal = {JOURNAL OF MEDICAL EDUCATION AND CURRICULAR DEVELOPMENT},
Year = {2020},
Volume = {7},
Month = {OCT},
Abstract = {Background: Flipped classroom has received much attention during the
   last few years in China, but inconsistent conclusions are made about the
   effectiveness this approach in health professions education. This review
   examined the findings of controlled studies published in Chinese in
   order to summarize the effects of the flipped classroom methodology.
   These studies focused specifically on undergraduate level of health
   professions students.
   Methods: A literature search was conducted using China National
   Knowledge Infrastructure (CNKI) and Wanfang Data Knowledge Service
   Platform in June 2019. No date restrictions were used. Peer-reviewed
   papers were reviewed and experimental studies were included if the study
   compared student outcomes using flipped classroom method versus
   traditional lectures. The revised version of the Kirkpatrick's model was
   applied to evaluate the effectiveness of the flipped classroom approach.
   Results: In total, 934 articles were obtained. Among them, 235 articles
   were full text reviewed and 59 met the inclusion criteria. Most of the
   student agreed that flipped classroom strategy was very helpful
   improving their self-learning ability, problem solving ability,
   teamwork, and communication skills, but reported increased workload and
   less-efficiency compared with traditional lectures. However, the
   majority of studies (n = 52) showed positive findings of the flipped
   classroom on changes in knowledge and skills, and 3 in negative. Among
   these 59 studies, there was little evidence of changes in behavior,
   organizational practice and patient outcome.
   Conclusions: Better design with reduced content should be considered for
   instructors to promote learning effectiveness. Long-term effects of

Abstract = {The concept of the flipped classroom has generated considerable interest
   in the educational context in recent years, especially in higher
   education. However, research to date has been controversial with regard
   to the effectiveness of flipped classroom instructions on college
   student learning outcomes. The purpose of the present study was to
   identify high-quality empirical publications that examine the learning
   outcomes of college students and to utilize meta-analyses to determine
   the overall effectiveness of flipped classroom instructions. A
   systematic database search that included the Web of Science, the
   Education Resources Information Center, and Elsevier ScienceDirect, was
   conducted to identify peer-reviewed studies that met the inclusion
   criteria. A total of 33 studies were included in this systematic review.
   Two reviewers independently performed both study identification and data
   extraction. The meta-analysis was conducted using Review Manager 5.3
   software, and the calculated effect sizes showed that flipped classroom
   instructions can positively influence college students' cognitive
   learning outcomes compared to traditional lectures. Moderator variable
   analysis suggests that the pedagogical approach was the only significant
   factor examined that influences the effectiveness of flipped classroom
   instruction. These results indicate that the flipped classroom
   instructional model helps college students to improve their cognitive
   learning across a wide-reaching synthesis of currently available
   interdisciplinary research reports. The flipped classroom was also found
   to be more effective when instructors integrate individualized active
   and collaborative pedagogical approaches.},

Abstract = {The aim of this study is to contribute to an increased understanding of
   the flipped classroom movement. A total of 7 teachers working in school
   years 4-9 and who both actively flipped their classrooms and had been
   early adopters in this movement were interviewed. Two research questions
   were posed: What characterizes flipped classroom instruction according
   to the teachers? and What objectives do the flipped classroom meet
   according to the teachers? Regarding the first research question, a
   characteristic of a flipped classroom was the flip, a task to be
   accomplished outside the classroom before class. In relation to the
   second research question we found three objectives: Student activity in
   class; Educational change; Being part of a digital learning community.},

Title = {Effectiveness of flipped classroom in developing 11th graders'
   grammatical competences in Arabic},
Journal = {INTERACTIVE LEARNING ENVIRONMENTS},
Abstract = {Several studies reported the effectiveness of flipped classroom in
   facilitating learning and improving students' learning experiences, but
   few have focused on language learning (Arabic in particular). This
   research aimed to explore the effectiveness of the flipped classroom
   strategy in developing female 11th graders' Arabic grammatical
   competences in Arabic. A pre-test-post-test quasi-experimental design
   and a questionnaire were utilized to achieve such a purpose, using two
   equal groups (N = 100). The experimental group received the flipped
   classroom-based treatment, whereas the control group was taught with the
   usual method of teaching. Statistical methods (i.e. ANCOVA,t-test, and
   Pearson correlation coefficient) were used to analyze the data. The
   analysis revealed statistically significant differences between the mean
   scores of the post-test of the two groups in favor of the experimental
   group and a large effect size (F = 0.35). The study recommended using
   the flipped classroom strategy in developing the grammatical competence
   of native Arabic speakers, with all necessary technologies and
   infrastructure provided for schools.},

Abstract = {In reality, the flipped classroom has gained popularity as a modern way
   of structuring teaching, where lectures move from in-class procedures to
   digitally-based assignments, freeing up the debate, and practice
   exercises class time. Therefore, it is essential to implement and
   analyze a way of teaching that will improve student performance. The
   paper aims to develop a model of the method of teaching science in Iraqi
   schools, and to assess whether teaching flipped classroom affects the
   achievement, motivation, and creative thinking of students by using the
   methodology of Multi-Criteria Decision Making (MCDM) in the Analytic
   Hierarchy Process (AHP). The AHP approach includes several steps,
   including setting assessment criteria and their weights, and by
   assessing the methodology of the flipped classroom as compared to the
   conventional cognitive learning process. An experiment was carried out
   in Iraqi secondary schools to examine the attitude of the students
   towards the subject of Chemistry. The findings have indicated that the
   students and teachers favored flipped classroom learning more than
   conventional cognitive learning. The study took the following parameters
   compared to the traditional approach: teaching techniques, learning
   flexibility, teaching aids effectiveness, student participation and
   working environment. This paper indicates that the teachers in Iraqi
   schools will be able to improve and do more preparation to shift towards
   flipped learning in the classroom.},

Abstract = {In Malaysia, the new teaching model of a flipped classroom is emerging
   in higher education with the aim of promoting student-centred learning.
   Hence the main purpose of this study is to identify the students'
   acceptance level, their perceptions, and the impact of their initial
   exposures to the flipped classroom model. With this in mind, a survey on
   undergraduate students' perceptions of the flipped classroom was
   evaluated at the School of Pharmaceutical Sciences, Universiti Sains
   Malaysia. Surprisingly, there was a low degree of acceptance and
   unfavourable impressions of flipped classrooms among students. The
   reasons were identified to be the inappropriate use of the flipped
   methodology and the increase of student workload. In conclusion, the
   implementation of the flipped classroom method was not straightforward
   in Malaysia with a tradition of more didactic teaching methods.},

Abstract = {This paper analyzes the impact of a Course Transformation process based
   on a Flipped Classroom strategy on Chilean Engineering students'
   attitudes toward university-level mathematics. The Attitudes Toward
   Mathematics Inventory (ATMI) questionnaire was applied as both pre- and
   post-test to 76 students in three mathematic courses (Calculus I,
   Calculus II and Elements of Algebra for Computing) at Universidad
   Catolica de Temuco's Faculty of Engineering which adopted a flipped
   classroom method. The results showed a significant positive change in
   the perceived value of mathematics in the four ATMI categories (P <
   0.05) with different effect sizes after the implementation of the
   flipped classroom and active learning strategies. The results suggest
   that the implementation of transformed courses using a Flipped Classroom
   method has a positive effect on students' attitudes toward Mathematics,
   especially in those who come from families with lower economical income.},

Title = {The flipped classroom: A meta-analysis of effects on student performance
   across disciplines and education levels},
Journal = {EDUCATIONAL RESEARCH REVIEW},
Year = {2020},
Volume = {30},
Month = {JUN},
Abstract = {The Flipped Classroom design has arguably revolutionized teaching across
   the globe. In this article we report the first comprehensive
   meta-analysis of its effects on student performance, relative to
   traditional teaching models, across disciplines and education level. We
   included 198 studies comprising 33,678 students in our meta-analysis.
   There were 174 studies conducted at the tertiary level, 21 at secondary,
   and three at primary school level. Overall, the flipped classroom had a
   moderate positive effect (g = .50) on student performance. The flipped
   classroom was beneficial regardless of discipline, with effect sizes
   ranging from weak (i.e., for IT, g = 0.30; k = 14) to strong (i.e., for
   humanities, g = 0.98; k = 34). Testing of other moderators relating to
   group sizes, in-class activities, pre-class testing, and the
   sophistication of a flipped classroom design provide evidence to suggest
   that the primary contributing factor to the flipped classroom effect is
   the opportunity it provides for structured, active learning and
   problem-solving.},

Title = {On the use of flipped classroom across various disciplines: Insights
   from a second-order meta-analysis},

Abstract = {Flipped classroom has become a popular buzzword in the post-secondary
   education setting, and it is one of the most visible trends in smart
   learning environments. Alongside this popularisation comes the view that
   the flipped classroom is something desirable. Yet, many educators remain
   divided over whether flipped classroom is really an improvement over
   traditional approaches. This paper is the first to synthesise all
   relevant meta-analytic information using a second-order meta-analysis
   approach on the effectiveness of the flipped classroom on student
   learning outcomes. By synthesising the findings of multiple primary
   meta-analyses instead of individual empirical studies, a second-order
   meta-analysis can more accurately account for publication bias and
   generate a more robust result. The present study synthesised and
   analysed the quality of 15 primary meta-analyses that involved 156,722
   participants in flipped and non-flipped conditions to provide the most
   exhaustive test of the flipped classroom approach on its effect on
   student learning outcomes in higher education to date. The mean random
   effect size, after trim-and-fill adjustment, was 0.37, p < 0.001 in
   support of flipped classrooms. To check the accuracy of the second-order
   meta-analysis results, we performed a study-level meta-analytic
   validation. We discuss possible contextual and methodological
   moderators.
   Implications for practice or policy:
   Educators should consider using the flipped classroom approach in their
   teaching because it increases learning performance compared with
   conventional non-flipped teaching.
   Educators could use the insights reported in this study to inform
   planning for future meta-analyses involving the flipped classroom
   approach.
   Educators could also use the insights reported in this study to inform
   planning for future empirical studies involving the flipped classroom
   approach.},

Abstract = {The objective of this article is to evaluate the effectiveness of the
   Flipped Classroom in the learning of Science in the stage of Primary
   Education. This model appears to adapt itself to the individual profile
   of each student by using different methodologies and teaching styles.
   The transformations that society faces in the scientific-technological
   field require rethinking and adapting scientific education. In a center
   of the Community of Madrid that participates voluntarily, two natural
   groups of 4th year have been selected, with 27 students in each of them.
   In one group the Flipped Classroom method is used and in another group a
   more traditional method is used, centered on the use of the textbook and
   teaching explanation. Finally, after 8 months of intervention, knowledge
   in Science is evaluated, observing higher significant scores in the
   group that learns with the Flipped Classroom method.},

Abstract = {The flipped classroom is a teaching innovation in which instructional
   content is delivered out of the classroom, often via videos, and the
   class period is used for application of the course material. While the
   popularity of the flipped classroom is growing exponentially, its
   benefits have not been extensively studied. In this study we compared
   three semesters of an undergraduate Genetics course that was
   non-flipped, but included a significant amount of active learning, to
   three semesters of a flipped course with the same content. Student exam
   performance was not statistically different between the active
   non-flipped and the flipped courses, suggesting that the benefits of the
   flipped environment may be similar to those achieved via active
   learning. We also examined student attitudes toward the flipped
   classroom, and found 56\% of students were satisfied, 39\% were
   dissatisfied, and 5\% were neutral toward the flipped classroom. Our
   survey revealed that the clearest defining characteristic of
   dissatisfied students was not a dislike of classroom active learning
   activities. Rather, dissatisfied students disproportionately disliked,

Abstract = {This descriptive study aimed to examine baccalaureate student
   psychomotor skill performance when given different methods of pre-skill
   lab preparation materials in a flipped classroom environment. Students
   utilized either a narrated video demonstration of the skill or a skill
   instruction sheet with photographic images as lab preparation materials.
   Psychomotor skill performance of insulin pen administration was
   evaluated. Results suggest the type of preparation methods used with the
   flipped classroom pedagogy does not significantly affect student
   performance on psychomotor skill acquisition.},

Title = {Student satisfaction with courses and instructors in a flipped
   classroom: A meta-analysis},
Journal = {JOURNAL OF COMPUTER ASSISTED LEARNING},
Year = {2020},
Volume = {36},
Number = {3},
Pages = {295-314},
Month = {JUN},
Abstract = {The flipped classroom model challenges the way educators structure and
   implement their courses, and how students learn. Although there is
   burgeoning evidence for the effectiveness of flipped classrooms for
   improving student performance, student satisfaction is also an important
   consideration insofar as student evaluations can affect uptake of new
   education approaches. Yet we know little about the extent to which
   students are satisfied with the flipped model. To address this
   discrepancy, this article reports a world-first meta-analysis of student
   satisfaction with flipped classrooms and teachers relative to
   traditional teaching approaches across disciplines and education level
   (overall 53 studies; 8,429 students). Overall, the flipped classroom had
   a weak-moderate positive effect on student satisfaction with courses (k
   = 50; g = 0.36) and instructors (k = 26; g = 0.40). We also report
   moderating effects relating to discipline, education level, pre-class
   testing, in-class activities, group size, and sophistication of flipped
   designs.
   Lay Description
   What is already known about this topic
   Implications for practice and/or policyWhat this paper adds
   The flipped classroom model is now widely employed around the world
   There is increasing evidence that it is associated with improved student
   performance, relative to traditional teaching approaches
   Student satisfaction with teaching has implications for student
   motivation and performance; teacher-related outcomes; and institution
   recruitment and funding
   Reports a world-first meta-analysis of effects of the flipped classroom
   model on student satisfaction, relative to traditional teaching
   approaches (overall 53 studies; 8,429 students)
   The flipped classroom has a weak-moderate positive effect on student
   satisfaction with courses (k = 50; g = 0.36) and instructors (k = 26; g
   = 0.40)
   Even a classroom that is only `minimally' flipped is associated with
   higher levels of student satisfaction, relative to traditional teaching
   models
   Flipped classroom designs should be encouraged on both pedagogical and
   pragmatic grounds; in the case of the latter, students prefer a flipped
   classroom approach
   Students are likely to respond positively to teachers and institutions
   who employ a flipped classroom approach},

Abstract = {Flipped classrooms have been growing in popularity in higher education
   for their potential to promote students' active engagement in learning.
   Ironically, the key to the success of flipped classrooms is the agency
   of students to actively participate in learning. The flipped classroom
   approach requires students' responsibility for their learning and a high
   level of self-regulation in completing individual and collaborative
   learning tasks. However, many college students tend to be more
   comfortable with a traditional, passive form of lecture-based course and
   are not yet prepared for an active form of learning. In this study, we
   developed a regulated learning-supported flipped classroom framework
   grounded in self-regulation and social regulation research. The purpose
   of this study was to investigate the impact of the regulated
   learning-supported flipped classroom on student engagement and
   performance. Our results showed that the flipped classroom with
   regulation guidance had a significant influence on students' use of
   higher-order cognitive skills. The implications of this study are
   further discussed based on the findings.},

Abstract = {In various case-based training courses, such as engineering, science and
   medical courses, students need to learn not only the skills to deal with
   problems, but also the knowledge to identify problems and make correct
   decisions. Such educational objectives have been recognized by educators
   as being important but challenging. In this study, an RSI (Recognize,
   Summarize, Inquire)-based flipped classroom is proposed to achieve this
   aim. Moreover, an explorative study was designed to probe the
   effectiveness of the proposed approach in a nursing case-based training
   course. The case-handling performances of the students trained with the
   RSI-based flipped classroom and those trained with the conventional
   flipped classroom were compared. The findings reveal that the RSI-based
   flipped classroom promoted the students' learning achievement,
   self-efficacy, critical thinking, and satisfaction more than the
   conventional case-based training did.},

Abstract = {Architectural physics is not only the basic course of architecture
   major, but also the support of architectural technology science. The
   suitable teaching method is the key to improve the teaching effect of
   architectural physics. This study takes the teaching innovation method
   of architectural physics as the goal, introduces the teaching idea of
   flipped classroom, and constructs flipped classroom teaching model of
   architectural physics. The basic photometric unit in the basic knowledge
   of architectural optics and its application are taken as an example to
   carry out empirical research. The result shows that, compared with the
   traditional classroom, flipped classroom is inclined to the deep
   learning, and the student's comprehensive ability is significantly
   higher than the traditional class. This study provides a reference for
   enriching the teaching methods of architectural physics and improving
   the teaching quality of architectural physics.},

Title = {Flipped classroom improves student learning in health professions
   education: a meta-analysis},
Journal = {BMC MEDICAL EDUCATION},
Year = {2018},
Volume = {18},
Month = {MAR 15},
Abstract = {Background: The use of flipped classroom approach has become
   increasingly popular in health professions education. However, no
   meta-analysis has been published that specifically examines the effect
   of flipped classroom versus traditional classroom on student learning.
   This study examined the findings of comparative articles through a
   meta-analysis in order to summarize the overall effects of teaching with
   the flipped classroom approach. We focused specifically on a set of
   flipped classroom studies in which pre-recorded videos were provided
   before face-to-face class meetings. These comparative articles focused
   on health care professionals including medical students, residents,
   doctors, nurses, or learners in other health care professions and
   disciplines (e.g., dental, pharmacy, environmental or occupational
   health).
   Method: Using predefined study eligibility criteria, seven electronic
   databases were searched in mid-April 2017 for relevant articles.
   Methodological quality was graded using the Medical Education Research
   Study Quality Instrument (MERSQI). Effect sizes, heterogeneity
   estimates, analysis of possible moderators, and publication bias were
   computed using the COMPREHENSIVE META-ANALYSIS software.
   Results: A meta-analysis of 28 eligible comparative studies
   (between-subject design) showed an overall significant effect in favor
   of flipped classrooms over traditional classrooms for health professions
   education (standardized mean difference, SMD = 0.33, 95\% confidence
   interval, CI = 0.21-0.46, p < 0.001), with no evidence of publication
   bias. In addition, the flipped classroom approach was more effective
   when instructors used quizzes at the start of each in-class session.
   More respondents reported they preferred flipped to traditional
   classrooms.
   Conclusions: Current evidence suggests that the flipped classroom
   approach in health professions education yields a significant
   improvement in student learning compared with traditional teaching
   methods.},

Title = {Enhancing the effectiveness of flipped classroom in health science

Journal = {BMC MEDICAL EDUCATION},

Abstract = {Background In a flipped classroom, students acquire knowledge before
   class and deepen and apply this knowledge during class. This way,
   lower-order learning goals are achieved before class and higher-order
   skills are reached during class. This study aims to provide an overview
   of the factors that contribute to the effectiveness of the flipped
   classroom and how these factors can be stimulated. The effectiveness of
   the flipped classroom is conceptualized in this study as test scores,
   the achievement of higher learning goals, and student perceptions.
   Methods A state-of-the-art review was conducted. The databases MEDLINE,
   PsycINFO, PubMed, Web of Science, and Scopus were consulted. The
   timeframe is 2016 till 2020. The studies were qualitatively analyzed
   according to the grounded theory method. Results After screening the
   studies based on the inclusion-and exclusion criteria, 88 studies were
   included in this review. The qualitative analysis of these studies
   revealed six main factors that affect the effectiveness of the flipped
   classroom: student characteristics, teacher characteristics,
   implementation, task characteristics, out-of-class activities, and
   in-class activities. Mediating factors are, amongst other factors, the
   learner's level of self-regulated learning, teacher's role and
   motivation, assessment approach, and guidance during self-study by means
   of prompts or feedback. These factors can be positively stimulated by
   structuring the learning process and focusing the teacher training on
   competencies and learning-and teaching approaches that are essential for
   the flipped classroom. Conclusion This paper provides insight into the
   factors that contribute to the effectiveness of the flipped classroom
   and how these factors could be stimulated. In order to stimulate the
   effectiveness of the flipped classroom, the positively and negatively
   affecting factors and mediating factors should be taken into account in
   the design of the flipped classroom. The interventions mentioned in this
   paper could also be used to enhance the effectiveness.},

Abstract = {A quasi non-equivalent, non-randomized factorial design, examined
   Chemistry students' attitudes towards chemistry and academic achievement
   in second year Bachelor of Education students taught with the flipped
   classroom strategy. In the study of 100 students, a pre-attitude test of
   30-items questionnaire was apportioned to ascertained students' attitude
   towards chemistry. Pre-test was also apportioned to the control and
   experimental group. This was followed by teaching using the flipped
   classroom strategy for experimental group and the control group was
   taught using the traditional approach. Thereafter, students in the
   experimental group wrote a post attitude test. A post-test was
   administered to both experimental and control group. The result of the
   post-attitude showed a significantly higher mean when compared to the
   pre attitude score. The result of the analysis using sample t-test
   showed students having a positive attitude towards chemistry, when
   taught using flipped classroom. The study also sought to find out the
   academic achievement of students taught with and without the flipped
   classroom strategy. Findings from the investigation of academic
   achievement revealed that students' academic achievement was
   significantly higher than those in the conventional group. The
   implications of these findings are that the flipped classroom strategy
   could improve attitude of students towards chemistry, thereby enhancing
   their academic achievement. This is so as students can play the lesson
   videos again and again at the comfort of their homes for mastery of
   concept in their lesson. The result of this study is especially relevant
   to the learning and teaching of chemistry in secondary and tertiary
   institutions in developing nations, Nigeria inclusive. This is so as the
   teacher per student ratio is high such that the teacher cannot carry
   every student along in the class within the short period provided.},

Abstract = {This article aims to describe the application and adaptation of the
   traditional classroom model to the so-called semi-flipped classroom
   model. In semi-flipping, differently from the flipped classroom,
   students can watch the videos in the classroom as well. The research was
   done a private HEI. The methodology adopted was qualitative and
   quantitative. The quantitative data were collected through a
   questionnaire from google forms tool, applied to the students of the
   IES, in its Venda Nova unit. For the qualitative approach, participant
   observation was used. This study was based on an earlier research
   applied in the same institution, when there was an attempt to implant
   the flipped classroom model. The application of the semi-flipped model
   aimed to remedy the main obstacles presented by the implementation of
   the flipped classroom model. The results reveal that the semi-flipped
   model had adherence and retained the advantages of the flipped
   classroom, obtaining better results.},

   the redesign of a first-year, principles of micro-economics course from
   a lecture-based course using active learning techniques in 2013 to a
   partial flipped classroom in 2014 and a full flipped classroom in 2015.
   Students perceived a higher degree of achievement of the learning goals
   in both flipped courses compared to the non-flipped active learning
   course. Moreover, participating in the partial or full flipped classroom
   decreased the odds of a D or F grade or of withdraw. However, only the
   partial flip was associated with overall better learning outcomes in the
   final exam, while there was no statistically significant difference
   between the non-flipped active learning course and the full flip. Age
   was negatively associated with learning outcomes and increased the odds
   of a D or F grade or of withdraw. Gender had no statistically
   significant impact on learning outcomes. Students were least satisfied
   with the full flip and equally satisfied with the non-flipped active
   learning course and the partial flip. Lower satisfaction appears to be
   due to increased workload, which students evaluated to be highest in the
   full flip, aswell as to elements of groupwork design. In the flipped
   classroom design, the pre-class multiple choice tests on Moodle emerged
   as a clear favorite in students' teaching evaluations.},

Abstract = {A flipped classroom model is an indispensable part of the English as a
   foreign language (EFL) writing courses as it helps the instructor to
   advance the learners' writing proficiency levels (Pavanelli, 2018).
   However, EFL students' attitudes toward the in-class and out-of-class
   writing models in a flipped classroom process are unknown. Understanding
   these issues have a vital importance as these will help educators
   arrange their writing classes based on the flipped classroom models in
   order to have an effective writing course in line with EFL students'
   needs (Abaeian \& Samadi, 2016). Therefore, this study purposed to
   investigate the EFL students' attitudes toward in-class and out-of-class
   writing models in a flipped classroom. A quantitative research design
   was employed through the use of a questionnaire which was employed to 30
   EFL students studying at a private university's English language
   teaching department. As the findings showed, although the EFL students
   had positive attitudes towards both flipped classroom models for
   writing, they preferred the out-of-class model and the majority of them
   stated that they prefer to produce their written work out-of-class
   settings. As a consequence of these, EFL educators should use an
   out-of-class flipped classroom model for writing, if they give priority
   to their EFL students' attitudes towards the writing models on account
   of having an effective writing course.},

Abstract = {Methodological guidelines for virtual teaching during the lockdown,
   tailored to Flipped Classroom, are suggested by the Spanish University
   Education System. This educational methodology is recommended as an
   effective method for distance learning due to COVID-19 by several
   articles, studies, research, universities and institutions in different
   countries around the world. However, what is the impact of these extreme
   circumstances on the implementation of Flipped Classroom in Higher
   Education? The study design is a descriptive and correlational research
   that compares the frequency of the implementation of Flipped Classroom
   before and during social distancing. This information is provided by the
   participants, university professors from the Faculty of Education
   Sciences of the University of Malaga, through an ad hoc questionnaire.
   The results reveal a significant increase in the frequency of Flipped
   Classroom sessions (z = -4.80; p <.001) during the lockdown. The data
   also show a significant increase in the quantity and variety of didactic
   resources (t = -2.390; p = 0.021), mainly those related to Flipped
   Classroom, with video (z = -2.860, p = 0.004) and audio (z = -2.049, p =
   0.040) files. University professors consider virtual teaching during the
   lockdown an opportunity for Flipped Classroom and digital skills that
   could improve the quality of university educational methodology.},

Title = {Flipped Classroom Experiences in Clinical Dentistry - A Strategic
   Mini-Review},
Journal = {OPEN DENTISTRY JOURNAL},
Year = {2021},
Volume = {15},
Pages = {717-727},
Abstract = {Background:
   Pedagogy in dental education has evolved over the decades. Today, many
   alternative modes of content delivery are being used as an adjunct to
   the traditional classroom. A flipped classroom is one among those that
   are being explored for teaching clinical dentistry.
   Objective:
   This mini-review is aimed at evaluating the available evidence in the
   efficacy of flipped classrooms and its related aspects in the learning
   curve of clinical dentistry.
   Methods.:
   A thorough literature search on electronic databases for all the studies
   focusing on the following evidence-based question: ``Is Flipped
   classroom in clinical dentistry a useful mode of pedagogy delivery? was
   performed. A combination of MeSH terms using Boolean operators
   ``AND,{''} ``OR:{''} FLIPPED {[}All Fields] AND ({''}dental health
   services{''} {[}MeSH Terms] AND ``health{''} {[}All Fields] AND
   ``services{''} {[}All Fields]) OR ``dental{''} {[}All Fields]) AND
   ({''}learning{''} {[}MeSH Terms] OR ``learning{''} {[}All Fields]).
   Specific terms such as ``Perio{''} OR ``Prostho{''} OR ``Restorative{''}
   OR ``Ortho{''} OR ``Oral medicine{''} OR ``Maxillofacial surgery{''} OR
   ``Pediatric{''} OR ``endo{''} was also used. Data from these articles
   addressing the aim of this study was extracted.
   Results:
   A total of 16 articles were considered for the review. The majority of
   the studies considered flipped classroom as a successful model of
   pedagogy. The most common mode of outside classroom activity was
   pre-recorded videos. In-classroom activities, a combination of seminars,
   interactive discussions, and quiz were explored. Time constraints, lack
   of faculty development programs are considered to be negative factors
   for the success of the flipped classroom.
   Conclusion:
   Within the limitation of the study, flipped classroom can be adapted as
   a method of pedagogy in clinical dentistry.},

Title = {Flipped classroom improves Omani nursing students performance and

Abstract = {Background Nursing students struggle with anatomy and physiology course
   because of the complicated terminology and the difficulty in handling
   large amounts of information. New, innovative instructional strategies
   must be integrated into nursing education to improve nursing students'
   performance in this challenging bioscience course. The aim of this study
   was to determine the impact of an innovative teaching strategy, the
   flipped classroom, on the performance and satisfaction of Omani nursing
   students in an anatomy and physiology course. Methods A
   quasi-experimental design was used with two classes of 112 first-year
   nursing students at the College of Nursing, Sultan Qaboos University,
   Oman. Online videos and active-learning activities about the respiratory
   system were developed and implemented in an anatomy and physiology
   course with 53 first-semester nursing students. The control group
   consisted of a previous cohort of 59 students enrolled in the same
   course but taught with a traditional lecture approach. The impact of the
   flipped classroom strategy was measured by students' performance on the
   final examination and students' self-reported satisfaction. Wilcoxon
   signed-rank and Mann-Whitney U tests were used to compare students'
   academic performance. Results Our results showed that the performance of
   the flipped classroom group was better than that of the traditional
   lecture group. The mean scores of students instructed with the flipped
   classroom method on the respiratory system items in the final
   examination were significantly higher than those of the control group, U
   = 1089.00, z = - 2.789, p < .005. Moreover, the results of a survey
   showed that nursing students were satisfied with the flipped classroom
   method. Overall, 68 to 78\% of students agreed or strongly agreed that
   the flipped classroom method improved their learning and increased their
   interest in the course. Conclusion Compared with the didactic lecture
   format, flipped classroom strategy improved Omani nursing students'
   performance in and satisfaction with an anatomy and physiology course.
   These results show that the flipped classroom is an important teaching
   strategy in nursing education.},

Abstract = {One of the biggest barriers preventing teachers from utilizing the
   flipped classroom approach in their teaching practices is the lack of a
   general and practical framework for guiding the design and
   implementation of flipped classrooms. This leads to the fact that the
   effectiveness of the flipped classroom approach is unconfirmed. Building
   on research findings from the field of learning and instruction, this
   study proposed a step-by-step general model named the O-PIRTAS
   (Objective, Preparation, Instructional video, Review, Test, Activity,
   Summary) flipped classroom model and examined its effectiveness in
   promoting student learning in an undergraduate psychology course. Two
   classes of 101 first-year undergraduates were taught by the flipped
   classroom model or the traditional lecture-based approach for 16weeks.
   The results supported the effectiveness of the flipped classroom model;
   the flipped model not only improved the students' perceptions of the
   teaching quality and peer interaction engagement but also promoted their
   generic skills development and examination performance. Instructional
   implications for implementing flipped instruction are provided, and
   directions for future research are discussed.},

Abstract = {The flipped classroom is a relatively new active learning pedagogical
   intervention, gaining popularity as a blended learning methodology. The
   flipped classroom comprises two distinct parts, directed learning
   carried out at the student's own pace away from the classroom and an
   interactive, class-based activity encouraging problem-solving and
   experiential learning. This research presents a 1-year study to measure
   student performance and perception toward a flipped classroom approach
   to teaching core biochemical calculations to first-year undergraduate
   biochemistry and genetics students. A post-task questionnaire showed an
   overall positive student perception with an associated significant
   improvement in the end of module summative assessment. These results
   suggest that this teaching approach offers some advantages over more
   traditional teaching pedagogies.},

Abstract = {When technologies like GeoGebra are Implemented In mathematics lessons,
   the focus should be on learners and their learning processes rather than
   on technologies. Student-centeredness Is a core characteristic of
   flipped classroom approaches. Recent further developments of flipped
   classroom approaches aim to foster learning through Inquiry In flipped
   scenarios. In this study, we are particularly focusing on the 5E-based
   flipped classroom approach. We Investigated how secondary mathematics
   teachers planned to use GeoGebra In their written lesson plans for
   5E-based flipped classroom scenarios. Using coding procedures related to
   qualitative content analysis, we conducted a document analysis on 24
   written lesson plans. Findings Indicate, for Instance, that participants
   not only planned to use dynamic GeoGebra materials In exploratory phases
   during class. Some teachers also Intended to use a screencast
   demonstrating the GeoGebra applet In a pre out-of-class phase to engage
   students In the Inquiry process or for consolidation after exploration.},

Abstract = {Purpose: : This study analyzed the bibliometric characteristics of
   flipped classroom publications in the Social Science Citation Index and
   Science Citation Index Expanded from 2000 to 2019.
   Methods: The terms related to ``flipped classroom{''} and ``inverted
   learning{''} were the keywords for searching journal articles on January
   3, 2020.
   Results: There are 645 articles (including 33 early-access articles),
   representing 1,938 authors in the 210 journals scanned. The United
   States, China, and Taiwan were three leading countries/regions in this
   field. In the top 10 countries, to 10 institutions, the top eight
   mostcited journals were identified by either the number of publications
   or the number of citations. Hot-spot themes from the 24 highly-cited
   articles and author keyword co-occurrence analysis focus on empirical
   research in the flipped classroom, the overall feasibility of the
   flipped classroom course design and practical model, and students'
   performances, and student-regulated learning (active learning and
   readiness) outcomes.
   Conclusion: TThe results indicate that the United States dominated
   flipped classroom research, originating most of the highly-cited
   articles, having more prolific authors, and presenting the most-cited
   institutions. Furthermore, little research has been undertaken into
   arriving at an understanding of evidentiary effectiveness or consistency
   in a flipped classroom. Based on the trends identified, we need a call
   for more specific types of research into the effectiveness of flipped
   classroom studies and systematic reviews.},

Title = {How the flipped classroom improves student learning in medical

Journal = {JOURNAL OF BIOLOGICAL EDUCATION},
Abstract = {The flipped classroom method has recently become popular in biology
   education. However, there is a lack of systematic and quantitative
   assessments on the efficiency of teaching medical microbiology using
   this novel approach. In this study, we performed a meta-analysis to
   explore the flipped classroom method's effects versus those of
   traditional lectures in medical microbiology education. Six electronic
   databases, including PubMed, Web of Science, ERIC, China National
   Knowledge Infrastructure (CNKI), Wanfang Data, and Chinese Scientific
   Journals Database, were searched to obtain relevant articles from the
   first publication on this topic up to March 2021. Study selection, data
   extraction, and quality estimations were conducted to analyse the
   effects. A total of 13 studies were included in this meta-analysis, with
   the results revealing a significantly improved effect within the flipped
   classroom model on students' theoretical {[}SMD = 0.56, 95\% CI (0.28,
   0.84), p < 0.0001] and practical examination scores {[}SMD = 0.70, 95\%
   CI (0.19, 1.20), p = 0.007]. In terms of its teaching effects, the
   flipped classroom approach improves students' learning interest,
   self-study abilities, knowledge mastery, and satisfaction, but does
   exacerbate their learning burden. The flipped classroom method possesses
   multiple advantages when compared to traditional lectures in medical
   microbiology education, but does increase the burden experienced by
   students.},

Abstract = {This study explores the implications of the flipped classroom experiment
   in South Korea as a counter-proposal for the school innovation project
   based on the Korean educational context. Using Dongpyung middle school
   in South Korea for this case study, this paper focuses on how and why
   the flipped classroom impacts Korea's education culture. The results of
   the experiment provide significant insights, such as promoting more
   active classroom learning and the improvement of student academic
   achievement. In particular, the narratives of the students and teachers
   in the flipped classroom experiment show the following positive impacts
   on learning and teaching: (1) Transformation into a more equal and
   democratic classroom, (2) restoration of enjoyment in learning and
   teaching, (3) improvement of self-confidence, and (4) inspiration for
   the learning and teaching community. Based on these results, this paper
   discusses possible implications of the flipped classroom as an
   alternative future class model in Korean society.},

Abstract = {The objective of this mixed research is to analyze the impact of flipped
   classroom in the educational process on the Combinational Circuits
   through data science and machine learning. Flipped classroom facilitates
   the organization of active activities before, during and after the
   class. The participants are 17 students of Electronic Electrical
   Engineering who took the Digital Design course in the National
   Autonomous University of Mexico during the 2019 school year. The results
   of machine learning indicate that the consultation of the videos before
   the class, resolution of the exercises during the class through the
   Quartus software and realization of the laboratory practices after the
   class positively influence the development of skills on circuit design.
   Data science identifies 3 predictive models of the use of flipped
   classroom through the decision tree technique. Finally, teachers can
   improve the learning process, develop the skills of students, build new
   educational spaces and carry out creative activities through flipped
   classroom.},

Abstract = {The flipped classroom approach is becoming increasingly popular. This
   instructional approach allows more in-class time to be spent on
   interactive learning activities, as the direct lecturing component is
   shifted outside the classroom through instructional videos. However,
   despite growing interest in the flipped classroom approach, no robust
   frameworks have been developed for the design or school/faculty-wide
   implementation of flipped classrooms. The aim of this article is to
   provide a foundation for the flipped classroom approach in Spector's
   (Foundations of educational technology: integrative approaches and
   interdisciplinary perspectives, Routledge, New York, 2016) model of six
   pillars of educational technology. After reviewing previous discussion
   of the flipped classroom approach, each pillar (i.e., communication,
   interaction, environment, culture, instruction, and learning) is
   discussed in the context of flipped learning. Using Spector's (2016)
   framework and drawing on relevant theories and empirical findings, 10
   recommendations are made. These recommendations are particularly useful
   for the school/faculty-wide implementation of flipped classrooms. As the
   foundational framework proposed in this article is only preliminary,
   further studies (e.g., design-based research) are recommended to
   increase the robustness of the design framework and ultimately improve
   educational practices.},

Abstract = {The flipped classroom offers a new approach to student-centred teaching
   and learning by moving the lecture out of the classroom. Research on the
   topic reveals that the flexibility of viewing the recorded lectures at a
   time and speed that is convenient to the student is what students
   appreciate mostly in the flipped classroom. This article examines the
   viewing pattern of students regarding recorded lectures in a course that
   has been flipped. The findings reveal a decline in the number of
   students who view the recordings over the duration of the course
   semester. Furthermore, the findings support earlier research results
   revealing that women and older students rely more on recorded lectures
   than other students. In addition, the study shows that there is a
   positive correlation between viewing the recorded material and the final
   grade of students in the course. It is thus surmised that even if
   in-class activity is very important for the flipped classroom to work,
   the recordings do have additional value, which is reflected by higher
   final course grades for students who view them. The flexibility of
   viewing recordings more than once and at the most relevant and
   convenient time seems to increase students' understanding, and is
   regarded an important asset of flipped classroom teaching.},

Title = {Evolving flipped classroom design in a cost/management accounting module
   in a rural South African context},
Journal = {ACCOUNTING EDUCATION},
Abstract = {Capturing and maintaining students' attention in higher education has
   long been a focal point in research. This is especially true of
   accounting courses, for which many students lack the contextual
   knowledge and integration skills required to be successful, particularly
   among rural students. The flipped classroom has been poised as a
   possible solution to improving student engagement, since it optimises
   the classroom contact time, while providing opportunities for the
   integration and application of knowledge. However, various constraints
   might make it difficult to implement the flipped classroom design in
   rural contexts. The purpose of this study was to evaluate whether the
   flipped classroom design would be beneficial to students studying on a
   rural campus. A three-year action research design was used to evaluate
   learning preferences and students' academic performance. The results
   revealed a need for a contextualised flipped classroom design that can
   improve student engagement and academic performance in rural settings.},

Abstract = {Project-based teaching method is a new task-driven and project-oriented
   teaching mode, it has become an effective means of practical teaching.
   However, in the process of project-based teaching, there are also some
   problems, such as difficult to control classroom teaching time and so
   on. As a new teaching mode under the background of informationization,
   flipped classroom can fully realize students' principal position in
   learning activities. Based on the applied research of English oral
   flipped classroom teaching, the concept of flipped classroom teaching is
   integrated into project-based teaching in this paper. By using flipped
   classroom and cooperative learning, students can reduce the time of
   teachers' classroom instruction and increase the time of students
   participation in project practice through independent learning of
   network courseware before class, it can make up for the shortcoming of
   classroom teaching time in project-based teaching.},

Abstract = {Purpose This paper aims to analyze the trends and contents of flipped
   classroom research based on 48 selected empirical articles published
   during 2017 and 2018. Design/methodology/approach The inductive content
   analysis was used as a methodology to investigate the content of flipped
   classroom research, including subject-specific areas, methodological
   approaches, technology tools or platforms, the most frequently used
   trending searches, countries of research, positive impacts and
   challenges. Findings The results of the analysis were interpreted using
   descriptive analysis, percentages and frequencies. This analysis found
   that various subjects were implemented in flipped classroom learning,
   and some technological tools were also used to enhance teaching and
   learning. Analysis of the impact revealed that the flipped classroom
   yielded positive learning outcomes on students' learning activities such
   as learning motivation and engagement, social interaction and
   self-directed learning skills. Meanwhile, the most significant
   challenges encountered by the instructor were the lack of students'
   motivation to watch pre-recorded video lectures or to study the contents
   outside of the class time. Originality/value The findings suggest that
   the flipped classroom concept might be effective in promoting
   twenty-first-century learning skills and developing the technology and
   information literacy competency based on national standards.},

Abstract = {Purpose Despite the enhanced popularity of flipped classroom research,
   there is a lack of empirical evidence reported about the different
   impacts revealed by the implementation of this concept. Therefore, to
   respond to this issue, this study aims to review and analyze the trends
   and contents of flipped classroom research based on 48 studies recently
   published in 2017 and 2018. The analysis was based on flipped classroom
   impacts from various fields. Design/methodology/approach A systematic
   literature review and content analysis were used as a methodology to
   investigate positive impacts and challenges of flipped classroom
   implementation. Findings The results of the analysis were interpreted
   using descriptive analysis. Analysis of the impact revealed that the
   flipped classroom yielded positive impacts on students' learning
   activities such as academic performance, learning motivation and/or
   engagement, social interaction and self-directed learning skills.
   Meanwhile, the most significant challenges encountered by the
   instructors is a lack of students' motivation to watch the pre-recorded
   video lectures or to study the contents outside of the class time.
   Originality/value While highlighting the limitations of an ineffective
   flipped classroom implementation, this study proposes further
   recommendations for future research.},

Abstract = {One of the blended learning strategies that researchers and educators
   commonly use in higher education is Flipped Classroom. The purpose of
   this case study was to explore how both professors and students perceive
   student engagement in flipped classrooms. Three college professors who
   implemented flipped classrooms and their 14 students participated in the
   study. Three individual faculty interviews and three student focus group
   interviewers were conducted. Five components of the utilization-focused
   evaluation model were used in the data coding. The findings revealed
   both positive and negative opinions depending on how they implemented
   the flipped classroom including the engagement of students and the
   environment. Faculty participants who fully implemented the flipped
   model had positive opinions about the implementation and student
   engagement, finding the model helped increase student performance and
   grades. In addition, the majority of student participants liked the
   challenges offered by the flipped classroom, which increased their
   engagement.},

Pages = {1518-1525},
Abstract = {This study aimed to investigate the effectiveness of flipped classroom
   practical project-based teaching on the learning of technical high
   school students with low self-esteem. This study used experimental
   research methods conducted for a total of 8 hours over a 4-week period
   of practical project-based instruction as experienced by the subject of
   the study engineering student at a technical high school in Taiwan.
   Students in the experimental group were taught using the flipped
   classroom method, while students in the control group were instructed
   via traditional teaching methods. Statistical analysis of student grades
   was conducted before and after the experiment, resulting in the
   following findings: (1) The flipped classroom method contributed to
   improving student learning ability and learning effectiveness in
   practical project-based course. (2) The flipped classroom method
   contributed to improving the test scores of students with low
   self-esteem. After interviewing the students with low self-esteem and
   gathering their feedback, this study discovered that students found
   previewing course presentations and interacting with other students in
   small groups to be very helpful. The flipped classroom method notably
   increases the feasibility of implementing practical project-based course
   and the effectiveness of student learning.},

Abstract = {Flipped Classroom methodology is gaining relative importance as time
   goes by, in part due to the spreading and accessibility of technological
   resources in the educational field. Nonetheless, the effectiveness of
   this methodology is still being discussed. In this sense, the aim of
   this study is to analyse whether flipped classroom methodology is a more
   effective methodology than other methodologies. For this purpose, a
   systematic review was carried out, considering as valid studies those
   that had a pre-post and a control group. Based on a total of 61 studies
   (n = 5541 students) from 18 databases, results revealed that Flipped
   Classroom methodology is more effective than other methodologies in
   terms of learning achievement, in secondary and higher education, and it
   could be more beneficial than other methodologies in other constructs as
   motivation, self-efficacy, cooperativeness and engagement, among others.
   In primary education, findings revealed that Flipped Classroom could be
   as effective as other methodologies with regard to learning achievement,
   and other construct, such as self-concept and social climate. Depending
   on the educational stage, the effect size of differences was between
   1.36 to 1.80 times larger in the case of Flipped Classroom group in
   comparison with control group. Based on these results, the Flipped
   Classroom could be more beneficial in comparison with traditional
   methodologies that are mainly used in higher education. However, it
   would not more beneficial in other educational stages where traditional
   approaches are not commonly used, such as in primary education.},

Title = {College English Flipped Classroom Teaching Model Based on Big Data and
   Deep Neural Networks},
Journal = {SCIENTIFIC PROGRAMMING},
Year = {2021},
Volume = {2021},
Month = {MAY 25},
Abstract = {With the rapid development of information technology, flipped classroom
   as a new type of mixed teaching mode relying on computer technology has
   changed the traditional teaching mode and formed a teaching process of
   ``learning first and teaching later,{''} and it has been used in many
   fields of teaching. Flipped classroom reverses the sequence of
   traditional teaching knowledge transfer and knowledge internalization
   and improves students' autonomy. However, it is still in the exploratory
   stage of the specific impact of the flipped classroom teaching model on
   college students' English autonomous learning ability. Therefore, this
   article proposes a novel college English flipped classroom teaching
   model based on big data and deep neural networks. The study has selected
   a total of 230 students in two classes of the second-year English major
   of a university as the research objects. Data are utilized to
   investigate the changes of the two groups of students' English
   autonomous learning ability and English academic performance, to explore
   the specific changes of college students' English autonomous learning
   ability and its influencing factors through interviews, and to predict
   and effectively analyze the weight of influencing factors through the
   deep neural network. This research enriches the theoretical research
   results of college students' English autonomous learning ability under
   the flipped classroom teaching model, provides reference for the
   cultivation of college students' English autonomous learning ability,
   and has certain reference significance for the optimization of the
   flipped classroom teaching model. The proposed research will support
   researchers and practitioners at college and university level.},

Abstract = {Despite recent interest in flipped classrooms, rigorous research
   evaluating their effectiveness is sparse. In this study, the authors
   implement a randomized controlled trial to evaluate the effect of a
   flipped classroom technique relative to a traditional lecture in an
   introductory undergraduate econometrics course. Random assignment
   enables the analysis to eliminate other potential explanations of
   performance differences between the flipped and traditional classrooms,
   while assignment of experimental condition by section and lesson enables
   improved statistical precision. The authors find that the flipped
   classroom increases scores on medium-term, high-stakes assessments by
   0.16 standard deviation, with similar long-term effects for
   high-performing students. Estimated impacts are robust to alternative
   specifications accounting for possible spillover effects arising from
   the experimental design.},

Abstract = {The effect of the flipped classroom model on students' academic
   achievement, academic satisfaction, and general belongingness was
   investigated using an experimental design. Purposive sampling was used
   to select 94 undergraduate students as participants. The participants
   were divided into three groups: one experimental group with the flipped
   classroom model and two control groups with the traditional classroom
   and distance education models. The groups attended the same course
   content sessions that are suitable for their classroom model over eight
   weeks. For analysis, descriptive statistics, dependent groups t-tests,
   Wilcoxon signed-rank test, ANCOVA, and ANOVA tests were performed.
   Students' academic achievement, academic satisfaction, and general
   belongingness levels significantly increased in the flipped classroom
   compared with the other classroom models. Suggestions for future
   research and limitations of the study are provided.},

Abstract = {In the recent times, the flipped classroom method is used commonly in
   higher education where pre-class online activities have a vital role.
   However, one of the most significant issues is the lack of participation
   of the students in pre-class online activities. In this study, a
   Gamified Flipped Classroom (GFC) environment proposes a solution to this
   issue. A true-experimental design was used in the study and the effects
   of teaching in this environment on students' online behaviors and
   achievements were investigated. The participants were fourth-year
   undergraduate petroleum and natural gas engineering students enrolled in
   a natural gas engineering course. The experimental group students
   learned with the gamified flipped classroom (GFC) method, while the
   control group students learned with the conventional flipped classroom
   (CFC) method. Data were collected from a natural gas concept test
   (NGCT), weekly quizzes, and data logs from Moodle. The research results
   indicated that teaching in the gamified flipped classroom (GFC) method
   showed a significant increase in the students' participation in the
   pre-class activities of the flipped classroom compared to the control
   group. Moreover, there was a significant increase in the achievement
   levels of the experimental group as compared to the control group. The
   results of this study provide evidence that the use of gamification
   elements in the pre-class phase of the flipped classroom method not only
   enhanced the students' pre-course online behaviour but also
   significantly improved their achievement.},

Abstract = {Background and purpose: The flipped classroom has not been fully
   exploited to improve tertiary education in Malaysia. A transformation in
   pharmacy education using flipped classrooms will be pivotal to resolve
   poor academic performance in certain courses. This study aimed to
   investigate the effectiveness of the flipped classroom in improving
   student learning and academic performance in a course with a
   historically low pass rate.
   Educational activity and setting: A quasi-experimental pre- and posttest
   control group design was employed. The experimental group experienced
   the flipped classroom for selected topics while the control group
   learned in a traditional classroom. Analysis of covariance was utilized
   to compare the performance on the final exam using the grade point of a
   pre-requisite course as the covariate. Students' perceptions of their
   experience in the flipped classroom were gauged through a web-based
   survey.
   Findings: Student performance on the final exam was significantly higher
   in the flipped classroom group. The lowest-scoring students benefitted
   the most in terms of academic performance. More than two-thirds of
   students responded positively to the use of the flipped classroom and
   felt more confident while participating in classes and tests.
   Summary: The flipped classroom is academically beneficial in a
   challenging course with a historically low pass rate; it was also
   effective in stimulating learning interest. The current study identified
   that for the flipped classroom to be successful, the role of educators,
   the feasibility of the approach, and the acceptance of students were
   important.},

Title = {Application of Flipped Classroom Model Driven by Big Data and Neural
   Network in Oral English Teaching},
Journal = {WIRELESS COMMUNICATIONS \& MOBILE COMPUTING},
Year = {2021},
Volume = {2021},
Month = {AUG 26},
Abstract = {With the advancement of big data and neural network technology, flipped
   classroom informatization has shifted the traditional order of knowledge
   transfer and internalization, emphasizing students' autonomous learning
   before class, knowledge absorption, and knowledge completion in class
   with the assistance of teachers. Students' internalization and
   consolidation create the conditions for individualized learning. In
   foreign teaching, the benefits and feasibility of the flipped classroom
   have been demonstrated, and it is a promising new teaching model.
   Although recent research on oral English teaching in Chinese
   universities has yielded promising results, students' classroom activity
   and participation remain low, learning initiative is lacking, and
   opportunities and time for oral training are insufficient. This article
   uses flipped classroom, big data, and neural network technology to teach
   college oral English classes, with the goal of determining whether the
   flipped classroom model can help students improve their oral English
   proficiency and self-learning ability, as well as exploring students'
   attitudes toward the flipped classroom model. This paper first proposes
   a big data and deep neural network-based algorithm for detecting oral
   English pronunciation errors, which can be used for self-correction of
   students in the flipped classroom mode to improve the quality of oral
   English teaching. Finally, we also conducted simulation experiments, and
   the experimental results show that our algorithm is 4.12\% better than
   SVM.},

Title = {The flipped-classroom approach to teaching horizontal strabismus in
   ophthalmology residency: a multicentered randomized controlled study},

Abstract = {BACKGROUND The flipped-classroom involves watching prerecorded lectures
   at home followed by group learning exercises within the classroom. This
   study compares the flipped classroom approach with the traditional
   classroom for teaching horizontal strabismus didactics in ophthalmology
   residency.
   METHODS In this multicenter, randomized controlled survey study from
   October 2017 to July 2018, 110 ophthalmology residents were taught
   esotropia and exotropia sequentially, randomized by order and classroom
   style. Flipped classroom participants were assigned a preclass video
   lecture prior to the in-class case-based activity. The traditional
   classroom included a preparatory reading assignment and an in-person
   lecture. Residents completed three identical 5-question assessments
   (pretest, post-test, and 3-month retention) and surveys for each
   classroom. The primary outcome measured residents' preferences for
   classroom styles; the secondary outcome compared knowledge acquisition.
   RESULTS In our study cohort, the flipped classroom resulted in greater
   at-home preparation than the traditional classroom (P = 0.001) and was
   preferred by 33 of 53 residents (62\%); 45 of 53 (85\%) wished to see
   the flipped classroom used at least 25\% of the time. The exotropia
   flipped classroom scored higher than traditional classroom on the
   pretest (3.71/5 {[}74\%] vs 2.87/5 {[}57\%]; P < 0.001) and post-test
   (4.53/5 {[}91\%] vs 4.13/5 {[}83\%]; P = 0.01) but not the 3-month
   retention test (3.53/5 {[}71\%] vs 3.37/5 {[}67\%]; P = 0.48). The
   esotropia classroom styles did not differ on pre- or post-test but
   demonstrated higher scores for the traditional classroom at 3-month
   retention (3.43/5 {[}69\%] vs 2.92/5 {[}58\%]; P = 0.03). Advantages
   cited for flipped classroom include being interactive and engaging while
   incentivizing better classroom preparation.
   CONCLUSIONS The flipped classroom method was received favorably by
   trainees and may complement traditional methods of teaching.},

Abstract = {The Flipped classroom is an instructional strategy that has been adopted
   in many engineering universities and has proven to be effective
   methodology to improve the performance of the students in higher
   education. The Flipped classroom ``flips{''} the traditional classroom;
   the students are involved with lecture notes or videos in out-class
   sessions and engage in an interactive, and collaborative in-class
   activities. In this research work, a model was proposed that
   incorporates the Visual, Auditory, Read and Kinesthetic (VARK) learning
   styles in a Flipped classroom which improves the higher order thinking
   skills of the learners. Higher order competency skills like
   Problem-solving, Critical thinking, and Creative thinking were assessed
   in the cloud-based Flipped classroom. MALAR competency for PCC
   (Problem-Solving, Critical Thinking, and Creative Thinking) competency
   skills are considered for assessment of higher-order competency skills

Abstract = {The purpose of this action research was to evaluate implementation of
   the flipped classroom model in a high school English classroom. The
   flipped classroom model is a specific blended teaching and learning
   approach that has been shown to increase student achievement, close the
   achievement gap, and increase student engagement and critical thinking.
   This study focused on how and in what ways implementing a flipped
   classroom model in a high school writing course affected students'
   writing quality, engagement, and perceptions of and experiences with the
   flipped classroom. Data collection incorporated a convergent parallel
   mixed methods design using preintervention and postintervention writing
   tasks, surveys, and observations. The triangulated findings revealed the
   flipped classroom model had a positive impact on student engagement and
   their perceptions of the model on their learning. Additionally, students
   made gains in their writing achievement during the model implementation.
   The general value of this blended learning model technique within the
   K-12 setting is discussed.},

Abstract = {A quantitative study was undertaken to investigate the accessibility of
   an undergraduate foundation statistics module for business and
   management students over four consecutive years, before and after the
   adoption of a flipped classroom teaching approach for a large cohort
   (similar to 500 students per year). Students' module feedback
   questionnaires, exam scores, basic student demographics and online
   engagement and attendance data were analysed. Those taught using the
   flipped classroom approach found the module significantly more
   interesting and the proportion of students who perceived the module to
   be difficult was roughly half that under the traditional teaching
   approach. However, there was no evidence of a difference in exam
   performance, class attendance or online engagement under the two
   teaching approaches. Perceptions of the flipped classroom differed
   according to gender, nationality and reported prior maths training, but
   the flipped classroom appears to enhance the student experience by
   making a traditionally difficult subject feel more accessible.},

Abstract = {Reversing the traditional classroom activities, in the flipped classroom
   model students view lectures at home and perform activities during class
   period inside the classroom. This study investigated the effect of a
   flipped classroom implementation on college physics students' motivation
   and understanding of kinematics graphs. A Solomon four-group design
   employing quantitative and qualitative methods was used to gather data.
   Four college physics sections participated in this study. Two groups
   received a researcher-developed, flipped classroom, instructional
   material over the course of 8 sessions. Test for Understanding Graphs in
   Kinematics (TUG-K) gain scores (post-test pretest) were significantly
   higher for the experimental groups (M=1.87, SD=2.909) compared with the
   control groups (M=0.54, SD=1.853). However, Physics Motivation
   Questionnaire II (PMQII) did not show a significant difference. The
   flipped classroom may enhance students' learning of kinematics graphs by
   improving their level of understanding, but was shown to have no effect
   on their motivation.},

Abstract = {Teaching processes have been changing in the lasts few decades from a
   traditional lecture-example-homework format to more active strategies to
   engage the students in the learning process. One of the most popular
   methodologies is the flipped classroom, where traditional structure of
   the course is turned over by moving out of the classroom, most basic
   knowledge acquisition. However, due to the workload involved in this
   kind of methodology, an objective analysis of the results should be
   carried out to assess whether the lecturer's workload is worth the
   effort or not. In this paper, we compare the results obtained from two
   different methodologies: traditional lecturing and flipped classroom
   methodology, in terms of some performance indicators and an attitudinal
   survey, in an introductory statistics course for engineering students.
   Finally, we analysed the changes in the relationships among variables of
   interest when the traditional teaching was moved to a flipped classroom
   by using Bayesian networks.},

Abstract = {Background Flipped classroom is known to improve learning efficiency and
   to develop one's ability to apply high-level knowledge. To investigate
   the effect of flipped classroom approach on teaching evidence-based
   medicine to medical technology students, we conducted a tailor-made six
   flipped classroom based EBM courses for medical technology students.
   Methods This study adopted a qusai-experimental design with 62 medical
   technology interns as the research object. Students in the experimental
   group attended the flipped classroom course, while students in the
   control group attended the traditional course. The learning outcomes
   were evaluated by Fresno test in both groups. Furthermore, to understand
   student's perceptions on the flipped classroom approach, students in the
   experimental group were required to fill in a satisfaction survey and
   answer some open-ended questions. Results The Fresno test scores of the
   experimental group were significantly higher than that of the control
   group. From the results of the satisfaction survey, we know that
   students were satisfied with this course format. Students claimed that
   the flipped classroom approach could improve their learning efficiency
   and the interactions with teacher could help them to think more deeply.
   Conclusions To conclude, most students showed positive attitudes and
   views on flipped classroom strategy. Moreover, students' questions were
   solved more effectively during class resulting in an improvement of
   effectiveness of evidence-based medicine trainings.},

Abstract = {The aim of this mixed research is to analyze the use of flipped
   classroom in the educational process on financial mathematics
   considering data science, machine learning (linear regression) and
   neural network. The sample is composed of 29 people who studied the
   career of Marketing and took the Financial Mathematics course during the
   2018 school year. The results of machine learning indicate that the
   consultation of the English and Spanish videos before the class, the
   realization of the exercises collaboratively through the spreadsheet and
   dissemination of the answers about the exercises through Google Drive
   during the class and the realization of the online exams and laboratory
   practices after the class positively influence the development of
   mathematical skills about simple interest. Data science identifies 6
   predictive models about the use of flipped classroom. On the other hand,
   the neural network identifies the aspects of flipped classroom that most
   influence the development of mathematical skills during the educational
   process on financial mathematics. Also, the students of Marketing
   consider that flipped classroom allows the construction of new
   educational spaces through the use of technology. Finally, flipped
   classroom is a pedagogical model that transforms the teaching-learning
   conditions and updates the organization of the activities before, during
   and after the class.},

Title = {Effectiveness of flipped classroom practices in teaching of science: a
   mixed research synthesis},
Journal = {RESEARCH IN SCIENCE \& TECHNOLOGICAL EDUCATION},
Abstract = {Background: Flipped classroom, which is inversion of conventional
   classroom procedures in simple terms, currently stands out as a popular
   teaching strategy for many Science courses.
   Purpose: In this article, we tried to make a reinterpretation of the
   findings of recent empirical studies conducted on the effectiveness of
   the flipped classroom approach in science education.
   Design and Methods: To determine the overall effect size of the flipped
   classroom implementations in Science courses, a meta-analysis of 30
   studies with such moderator variables as education levels, durations of
   implementations, various subjects areas of science and class sizes was
   carried out. To consolidate the academic achievement theme dwelled on in
   the meta-analysis part, a meta-thematic analysis based on document
   analysis of qualitative studies was conducted to expound in detail
   general characteristics of the approach, its effect on academic
   dimension, its contribution to the affective domain and classroom
   environment.
   Results: The findings reveal that the flipped classroom implementations
   have a positive medium effect (g = 0.727) on academic achievement in
   Science classes. Physics and Chemistry classes have the highest effect
   size values while Biology has the lowest effect size; the flipped
   classroom practices proved best in small size classes and at Primary
   School level with the highest effect sizes.
   Conclusions: The findings of both analyses provide insights into
   applicability of the approach in teaching of Science and its
   sub-branches. The drawbacks of the approach are also discussed with some
   suggestions for implication.},

Title = {Improving Students' Higher Order Thinking Skills and Achievement Using
   WeChat based Flipped Classroom in Higher Education},
Journal = {EDUCATION AND INFORMATION TECHNOLOGIES},
Abstract = {This quasi-experimental study compared traditional teacher-centered
   instruction and a WeChat based flipped classroom to investigate student
   achievements and higher order thinking skills, such as critical thinking
   and problem-solving. The WeChat based flipped classroom adopted a
   Structured Query Language (SQL) lesson from an information technology
   course. The 94 university students were divided into an experimental
   group (n = 50) and a control group (n = 44), and an achievement test,
   the critical thinking disposition inventory-Chinese version (CTDI-CV),
   and a questionnaire and problem-solving survey used in both groups. It
   was found that the flipped classroom student achievements and higher
   order thinking skills were significantly better than their peers who had
   been taught in a traditional classroom environment. This study provides
   empirical evidence that higher education achievement and higher order
   thinking skills can be improved using a WeChat-based flipped classroom
   approach and is a valuable reference for both instructors and educators
   on the use of social software.},

Abstract = {The study examines the effectiveness of the flipped classroom teaching
   strategy in the context of English language classroom. The research is
   focused on the development of the communicative ability of the students
   in the foreign language, views of the participants on their experience
   of flipped classroom, and identification of measures to overcome the
   issue of low homework completion. The presented data are based on an
   experiment conducted by the author at the University of Granada (Spain),
   with a group of undergraduate students attending a compulsory foreign
   language course. The data were collected using a standardized exam; an
   observation diary to evaluate the development of the students'

Title = {Evaluating the flipped classroom approach in Asian higher education:
   Perspectives from students and teachers},

Abstract = {The flipped classroom approach has been gaining substantial momentum and
   is well received in Asia. Using a qualitative approach, this study
   examined how the flipped classroom approach affects the teaching and
   learning experiences of students and teachers in Asian higher education.
   Five Faculty of Education courses were examined in this study. Five
   individual interviews were conducted with the course instructors and
   three focus-group interviews were conducted with a total of 12 students.
   Data was analysed by thematic analysis. Using the self-determination
   theory (SDT) as a theoretical framework, five themes emerged. The
   results of this study suggest that the flipped classroom approach has
   substantial potential to fulfil the three basic cognitive needs among
   university students in the field of education. Most students in this
   study felt positive about the flipped classroom approach and students'
   and instructors' positive feelings can be explained using the main
   components of the SDT. Subsequently, this paper presents a summary table
   on recommended strategies for before, during and after-class
   implementation of the flipped approach.},

Abstract = {This study presents the results of a mixed-methods approach in finding
   the effects of the WebQuest-based flipped classroom on the EFL learners'
   inferential reading comprehension skills. A group of EFL learners
   attending an IELTS course participated in the study. T-test and one-way
   repeated measures ANOVA were used to analyze the quantitative data. The
   results showed that the WebQuest-based flipped classroom effectively
   developed the learners' inferential reading comprehension skills, and
   its long-term effect was also confirmed through the delayed post-test
   scores. The participants' attitudes towards the WebQuest-based flipped
   classroom effects were also explored by conducting semi-structured
   interviews analyzed by utilizing thematic analysis through which the
   participants' perspectives were coded and categorized. The findings
   revealed the EFL learners' mainly positive attitudes towards the
   effectiveness of this innovative approach in developing their
   inferential reading comprehension skills. The pedagogical implications
   of using WebQuest-based flipped instruction as an efficient and
   effective alternative to traditional classroom practice are discussed.},

Abstract = {As a new teaching mode that changes the traditional roles of teachers
   and students, flipped classroom is a classroom teaching form which is
   being explored in the teaching reform. In this paper, we study the
   teaching of the course based on MOOC, and explore how to use the course
   resources of MOOC to apply to the teaching of flipped classroom. On this
   basis, through questionnaire survey, the current situation of MOOC
   quality monitoring and guarantee in some universities are investigated.
   It is found that the quality standard of MOOC course construction is not
   perfect and the teaching quality monitoring and guarantee system is not
   perfect. In view of the existing problems, a quality monitoring and
   security system for flipped classroom based on MOOC is constructed.},

Abstract = {The use of the flipped classroom approach in higher education STEM
   courses has rapidly increased over the past decade, and it appears this
   type of learning environment will play an important role in improving
   student success and retention in undergraduate chemistry
   ``gatekeeper{''} courses. Many adopters of the flipped classroom
   structure see the greatest benefit originating from the additional time
   this format provides for the implementation of student-centered learning
   activities during the classroom period. However, results from recent
   quasi-experiments suggest that improved course performance for students
   in flipped classroom environments has a significant contribution from
   the online preclass activities. In order to compare the impact of the
   preclass online learning environment to the in-class collaborative
   activities typically done in a flipped classroom, a randomized
   controlled trial (RCT) was conducted with student volunteers. A two-day
   organic chemistry stereochemistry unit was delivered to students who
   were randomly assigned to ``flipped classroom{''} and ``traditional
   lecture{''} treatment groups. Performance gains were measured after each
   phase of the instructional intervention for both treatment groups, and
   these gains were compared to students from a randomly assigned negative
   control group. A mixed-methods ANOVA indicates that under these
   experimental conditions the online learning component appears to account
   for most of the improvement in posttest scores observed in the flipped
   classroom treatment. These results suggest optimizing the design of the
   asynchronous online learning environment will positively impact student
   performance outcomes. Therefore, this component of the flipped classroom
   deserves more attention from instructional designers and classroom
   practitioners.},

Abstract = {PURPOSE To compare the flipped classroom (home pre-taped lectures
   followed by in-class group exercise) to the traditional classroom (home
   reading assignment followed by in-class lecture) for horizontal
   strabismus didactics in ophthalmology residency.
   METHODS All PGY2-4 residents from four U.S. ophthalmology residencies
   without prior residency flipped-classroom experience were invited to
   esotropia and exotropia sessions sequentially, with random order and
   assignment to flipped and traditional classrooms. Content test scores
   before and after the two classrooms were compared. Surveys were
   administered to assess participant experience.
   RESULTS A total of 40 residents attended each session. Likert scale
   evaluation of preparatory material and classroom activity did not differ
   between sessions; however, divided by year of training, 70\% of senior
   residents (PGY3-4) and 39\% of first-year (PGY2) residents preferred the
   flipped classroom over the traditional classroom. Pre- and post-test
   scores for the flipped classroom exceeded those of the traditional
   classroom for the exotropia course (P = 0.01 and P = 0.001, resp.) but
   not for the esotropia course. There was significant improvement between
   pre- and post-tests for both styles of learning.
   CONCLUSIONS The flipped classroom had a favorable effect on test scores
   for only one of the two strabismus subjects but was preferred over the
   traditional classroom among PGY3-4 residents.},

   Fifty-one university students participated in a web-programming course.
   The students in the experimental group used the proposed approach, while
   those in the control group used the conventional inquiry-based flipped

Abstract = {In this study, we applied the flipped-classroom to the general chemistry
   experiment lecture of the domestic university with strong teacher-led,
   and explored the effects and possibilities of the course. For this
   purpose, 30 students who were enrolled in the Science Education
   Department of the College of Education in the metropolitan area were
   randomly assigned to two groups, namely, the flipped-classroom group and
   the traditional class group. Then, we developed a general chemistry
   experiment lessons based on the flipped-classroom along with visual
   materials and we applied the lessons for 15 weeks. After all the
   classes, we conducted a survey to see the students' perception of the
   general chemistry experiment lecture by flipped classroom. As a result
   of analysis, the students of the flipped-classroom group were more
   positive than the students of the traditional class group in terms of
   the usefulness of the class activity, the importance of each activity
   element for the successful learning, the learning level, and the
   intention for another lesson. As a result of analyzing students'
   perceptions in terms of general chemical experiment activities such as
   conducting experiments or writing reports and understanding the contents
   of experiments, the average score of the flipped-classroom group was
   higher than the traditional class group, and the main cause of this
   result was the video material provided by prior learning activities. In
   addition, as a result of analyzing students' perceptions in terms of
   interactions and self-directed learning in class, the average score of
   the flipped-classroom group was generally higher than the traditional
   class group. In particular, students' interactions and self-directed
   learning were statistically significant differences between the two
   groups. And the students' perception of video material was very
   positive, and it was analyzed that the video that the instructor
   directly explained experiment theory and method was the most favorite
   videos of students. We discussed educational implications of these
   findings.},

Abstract = {Flipped classroom is an emerging course delivery method, where the
   traditional in-class and out-of-class activities flip places. The
   lectures are given out-of-class with electronic resources and in-class
   time is reserved for group activities and discussion with the
   instructor. In this study, we present our implementation of a flipped
   classroom in a senior level undergraduate engineering course. An
   extensive perception analysis was carried out with anonymous surveys and
   face-to-face interviews with students. Performance analysis of the
   flipped class was carried out by comparing the achievement level in the
   course learning outcomes of previous years' traditional classes and
   recent year's flipped class. The out-of-class lectures were implemented
   as machine-voice-narrated presentations. The effect of machine voice on
   the flipped classroom is also examined. Students' perception and
   reaction to various aspects of the flipped class are documented.
   Performance analysis showed a significant improvement in one category of
   course learning outcomes. Student perception was positive overall.},

Title = {BIBLIOGRAPHIC REVIEW OF THE FLIPPED CLASSROOM MODEL IN HIGH SCHOOL: A
   LOOK FROM THE TECHNOLOGICAL TOOLS},
Journal = {JOURNAL OF INFORMATION TECHNOLOGY EDUCATION-RESEARCH},
Year = {2020},
Volume = {19},
Pages = {451-474},
Abstract = {Aim/Purpose The purpose is a bibliographic review that seeks to offer a
   clearer vision of the impact of technological tools on the
   implementation of the flipped classroom model.
   Background This document reviews the flipped classroom and secondary
   education literature to analyze what technological tools are used to
   implement this model in secondary education settings and their impact on
   students.
   Methodology For the review, an analysis of 61 articles found in SCOPUS
   and WOS was carried out, processed with a scientometric tool, where the
   implementation of the inverted classroom model in high school is
   evident, and, according to these, an in-depth analysis was carried out
   on which tools are most used and in which contexts they are applied.
   Contribution This document offers new researchers a more unobstructed
   view of what type of technological tools have been implemented in the
   flipped classroom model in the context of high school and how students
   perceive them.
   Findings This review analyzes the following aspects:
   Analysis of the leading countries where the flipped classroom model is
   applied in secondary education.
   Analysis of the subjects where the flipped classroom model has been
   implemented.
   It offers an analysis of the most used technological tools and in which
   contexts they are applied (online or offline).
   Impact on Society This document helps new researchers make a conscious
   decision about the type of tool to implement to support the flipped
   classroom model and shows the importance of developing technological
   tools that are not limited by the use of the Internet so that they can
   reach a more significant number of people.
   Future Research Carry out research that focuses on applications that
   support low connectivity contexts, in order to improve the
   implementation of the flipped classroom model.},

Abstract = {The effectiveness of flipped classroom approaches can be improved by
   combining it with other pedagogical models such as inquiry-based
   learning. Implementing inquiry-based learning in flipped classroom
   scenarios requires teachers to plan arrangements for in- and
   out-of-class activities carefully. In this study, a design heuristic
   based on the 5E inquiry model was developed to support teachers'
   practice of planning inquiry-based flipped classroom lessons. Following
   a design-based research approach, the design heuristic progressed
   through two cycles within 2 years. The design heuristic was implemented
   in both cycles in an online professional development course for
   secondary mathematics teachers. In the first cycle, 18 lesson plans were
   collected and analysed using the 5E lesson plan scoring instrument.
   Results showed that the design heuristic helped teachers to set up
   lesson plans for flipped classroom scenarios which were mostly in line
   with the 5E model. However, the evaluation phase was insufficiently
   addressed. Revision decisions were made at the end of the first cycle,
   and the design heuristic was revised and re-implemented in a second
   cycle. Results of the second cycle showed another 19 participating
   teachers who also struggled in choosing appropriate assessment
   techniques, an issue which could not be resolved with the proposed
   design heuristic. This paper describes the development of the design
   heuristic as well as relevant design principles for inquiry-based
   flipped classroom scenarios. The proposed design heuristic is not domain
   specific. Hence, further research could examine its use in other
   subjects or interdisciplinary as inquiry-based flipped classroom
   approaches are one of the emerging pedagogies.},

Title = {Examining the impact of flipped classroom on writing complexity,

Journal = {COMPUTER ASSISTED LANGUAGE LEARNING},
Abstract = {The present study explored the impact of flipped classroom on English as
   a foreign language (EFL) students' global writing performance and
   writing complexity, accuracy, and fluency (CAF) through a
   quasi-experimental research design. In so doing, two intact classes were
   selected from an Iranian university as the participants of the study and
   they were randomly assigned as the control and experimental groups with
   24 and 27 EFL students respectively. Over a period of one semester, the
   control group (the non-flipped classroom) was taught using traditional
   writing instruction whereas the experimental group (the flipped
   classroom) was taught in a flipped learning mode. The students'
   performance on two timed writing tasks was examined in terms of global
   writing performance and writing CAF. Paired samples t-tests, one-way
   ANCOVA, Mann Whitney U, and Wilcoxon Signed Rank tests were used to
   analyse the data. The results demonstrated that the flipped classroom
   significantly developed and outperformed the non-flipped classroom on
   EFL students' global writing performance and writing fluency; however,
   its effect on the students' writing complexity and accuracy fell short
   of significance. Based on the findings, implications are provided for
   EFL writing instruction.},

Journal = {THINKING SKILLS AND CREATIVITY},

Abstract = {Recent advances in science suggest that the medical and biomedical
   fields will change rapidly in the next years. Training adaptable and
   innovative professionals has been identified as an urgent need. The
   flipped classroom approach has garnered significant attention in higher
   education as a methodology to train health science students for higher
   order thinking skills, such as creativity and critical thinking, as well
   as for questioning how their future profession will affect society. This
   study examines how the implementation of flipped classroom methodology
   fosters the development of creativity and critical thinking skills in
   undergraduate health science students, assesses the students' opinions
   on this methodology, and measures its effects on their learning results.
   A descriptive-evaluative research based on the combination of
   quantitative statistical techniques and qualitative content analysis
   methods was carried out. Ninety-three students participated in this
   study during the academic year 2016-2017. The effect of flipped
   classroom activities was assessed using creativity, critical thinking
   skills, students' opinions, and learning result variables. The results
   showed that (i) students had the perception of having developed creative
   and critical thinking skills and social awareness throughout the flipped
   classroom methodology; (ii) students were highly satisfied with this
   teaching method and recommended implementing it as a regular activity of
   the curriculum; (iii) better learning results were obtained using this
   method than with traditional learning; and (iv) the length of sessions
   and the type of knowledge to be assessed have been identified as the
   main limitations to implementing this method. Data of this study provide
   insight to how complex skills (e.g., creativity and critical thinking),
   and their effects on learning results, can be improved in undergraduate
   students of health sciences throughout the flipped classroom method.},

Abstract = {This study re-designed the classroom activities with consideration to
   interactions between human factors, such as gender and cognitive style,
   to technology as well as human-to-human interactions in the flipped
   classroom and explored their interrelationships. Sixty-two first-year
   college students of a Packaged Software and Application course were
   divided into two groups. The experimental group (N = 29) employed the
   revised flipped classroom format, while the conventional flipped
   classroom model was used with the control group (N = 27). Research data
   were obtained via pre-class quizzes, final grades, a learning
   satisfaction questionnaire, and interviews. The results led to the
   following conclusions: (1) Cognitive style and learning strategy
   significantly affected students' learning performance and satisfaction
   in both the flipped and revised flipped classrooms. (2) The interactive
   video, peer-learning, and social management issues associated with group
   work may motivate students' self-regulation. The implications of these
   results for the design of the flipped classroom are discussed in detail.},

Abstract = {Flipped classroom may overcome weaknesses of live demonstration in
   teaching orthodontic wire-bending. This study aims to compare the
   effectiveness between flipped classroom and live demonstration in
   transferring skills for fabricating Adams clasp. Forty third-year
   undergraduate dental students were assigned to two groups. The students
   in group LD (n = 20) attended a live demonstration while students in
   group FC (n = 20) attended a flipped classroom. Both groups were taught
   on skills to fabricate Adams clasp in a standardised way. Each student
   from both groups were asked to submit an Adams clasp for a blinded
   quality assessment by two trained and calibrated assessors using a
   18-item rubric, followed by validated students' satisfaction
   questionnaires to evaluate their perceived satisfaction on the teaching
   method received. A crossover study was then conducted three weeks later
   where LD attended a flipped classroom while FC attended a live
   demonstration. Students' satisfaction questionnaires were again
   collected from each student for blinded analysis. Mean scores for the
   quality of Adams clasp were 9.775 and 9.125 for LD and FC, respectively.
   No significant difference was detected between the two groups.
   Statistically significant association was found for one statement on the
   questionnaire, ``I found the classroom arrangements conducive for the
   wire-bending activity{''} (p = 0.010). No significant differences were
   found between the two groups for other statements (p > 0.05). In
   conclusion, within the limitations of the study, flipped classroom is
   equally effective as conventional live demonstration in transferring
   orthodontic wire-bending skills for fabrication of Adams clasp. However,
   students perceived the classroom arrangements during the flipped
   classroom significantly more conducive for teaching orthodontic
   wire-bending.},

Abstract = {PurposeThe purpose of this study was to assess dental student learning
   in a dental anatomy module between traditional lecture and flipped
   classroom cohorts.
   MethodsTwo cohorts of predoctoral dental students (N=70 within each
   cohort) participated in a dental anatomy module within an Introduction
   to the Dental Patient (IDP) course ({[}traditional/lecture cohort:
   academic year (AY) 2012, 2013] and {[}flipped classroom cohort: AY 2014,
   2015]). For the dental anatomy module, both cohorts were evaluated on
   pre-clinical tooth waxing exercises immediately after each of five
   lectures and tooth identification after all lectures were given.
   Additionally, the cohorts' performance on the overall IDP course
   examination was compared.
   ResultsThe flipped classroom cohort had statistically significant higher
   waxing scores (dental anatomy module) than students in the traditional
   classroom. There was no statistically significant difference for tooth
   identification scores and the overall IDP course examination between the
   traditional vs flipped approach cohorts. This is due to the latter two
   assessments conducted at the end of the course gave all students enough
   time to review the lecture content prior to the assessment resulting in
   similar scores for both cohorts.
   ConclusionThe flipped classroom cohort promoted students' individual
   learning and resulted in improved students' performance on immediate
   evaluation but not on the end of the course evaluation. Redesign of
   courses to include a new pedagogical approach should be carefully
   implemented and evaluated for student's educational success.},

Abstract = {This quantitative research aims to analyze the incorporation of the
   flipped classroom in the teaching-learning process on mathematics. The
   sample consists of 88 students of the Business School who studied the
   subject Basic Mathematics for Business during the 2016 school year. This
   study analyzes the impact of the flipped classroom for the compression,
   skill, application and utility of the derivatives. By means of
   regression, these variables are used for the construction of four
   forecast models related to the grade of the partial exam. The results of
   learning machine with 50\%, 60\% and 70\% of training indicate that the
   flipped classroom is an innovative, creative and ideal model to
   facilitate the teaching-learning process on mathematics. Likewise, the
   science of data allows establishing different predictive models on the
   use of the flipped classroom in the educational field by means of the
   decision tree technique. Finally, teachers can modify and update school
   activities through the flipped classroom.},

Title = {Facilitating self-efficacy in university students: an interactive
   approach with Flipped Classroom},
Journal = {HIGHER EDUCATION RESEARCH \& DEVELOPMENT},
Abstract = {The aim of this study is to investigate the perceived self-efficacy of
   university students after experiencing several Flipped Classroom
   sessions at different time points: prior to the outbreak of the COVID-19
   pandemic (onsite instruction) and after confinement at home (online
   instruction). The study's methodology followed a quantitative approach
   in which a total of 376 university students who had experienced the
   Flipped Learning sessions completed a general self-efficacy
   questionnaire. The results showed that the perceived self-efficacy is
   influenced by the academic year in which the students are enrolled, the
   modality in which the Flipped Classroom experience has been implemented
   (online or onsite) and the predisposition to innovation. In terms of
   practical implications, the Flipped Classroom applied in online formats
   could be a highly useful resource for designing active learning
   environments in which university students could improve their sense of
   self-efficacy. Consequently, their expectations and academic performance
   could also be improved.},

Abstract = {Currently, the ``Flipped Classroom{''} is one of the pedagogical models
   that are revolutionizing the field of education, and it may be a way for
   changing the higher education. However, there is insufficient evidence
   yet of its advantages and disadvantages in this educational stage.
   The present research tries to analyse the perception and assessment made
   by the students who have experienced Flipped Classroom and what are the
   learning effects. Due to the characteristics of the phenomenon we
   decided to use a qualitative methodology based on case studies taking as
   unit analysis, in a subject data collection instrument was chosen based
   on questions directed interviews with open-ended responses.
   The results show that there is no agreement on the students regarding
   the Flipped Classroom. On the one hand, students are positive about the
   method and value the educational possibilities that make practical
   activities in the classroom, and work collaboratively. And secondly,
   they are a group of very critical students with the model and prefer to
   continue using a traditional methodology, mainly due to lack of habit of
   using active methodologies and establish the commitment to learning that
   these require. The main proposals for improving the methodological
   design, essentially, are the result mainly about the habits of use it.},

Abstract = {Students nowadays are hard to be motivated to study lessons with
   traditional teaching methods. Computers, smartphones, tablets and other
   smart devices disturb students' attentions. Nevertheless, those smart
   devices can be used as auxiliary tools of modern teaching methods. In
   this article, the authors review two popular modern teaching methods:
   flipped classroom and gamification. Next, they implement flipped
   classrooms as an element of IoT (Internet of Things) into learning
   process of computer networks course, by using Cisco networking academy
   tools, instead of traditional learning. The survey provided to students
   shows good feedback from students. The authors report the impact of
   flipped classroom implementation with data obtained from two parallel
   sections (one flipped classroom and the other traditional classroom).
   The results show that the flipped classroom approach is better than the
   traditional classroom approach with a difference of approximately 20\%
   increase in the average of attendance, lab work, quizzes, midterm exams
   and final exam.},

Abstract = {This research was conducted to suggest a design for instructional
   support that faculty members could use to promote an effective flipped
   classroom. To accomplish this, a questionnaire survey was first
   conducted on the current state of flipped classrooms for university
   faculty members in order to obtain teacher support methods. Second, the
   survey results were used to design instructional support for faculty
   members to promote an effective flipped classroom based on the
   integrated design, evaluation, and assessment of loadings (IDEAL) model.
   By examining the survey results, the author identified four points as
   problems and opportunities to define goals, and from which to explore
   possible strategies. Based on these points, the author developed and
   prepared a learning environment about writing and a staff development
   course for teachers to experience the flipped classroom as both learners
   and teachers. After experiencing the flipped classroom, instructors
   developed lessons based on their reflections as learners.},

Abstract = {The flipped classroom instructional strategy is thought to be a good way
   to structure learning experiences to improve student learning outcomes.
   Many studies have been conducted to examine the effects of flipped
   classroom on student learning outcomes compared to the traditional
   classroom, but the results were inconclusive. The purpose of this study
   was to examine the overall effect of the flipped classroom instructional
   strategy on student learning outcomes in relation to a set of moderating
   variables including student levels, publication types, study durations,
   and subject area. This meta-analysis examined studies that compared
   classrooms that used the flipped classroom instructional strategy and
   classrooms that did not. Seventeen databases were searched to identify
   literature meeting our inclusion criteria and resulted in 55
   publications with 115 effect size comparisons on cognitive student
   learning outcomes published between 2000 and 2016. Overall, we found a
   statistically significant effect size (g = 0.193; p < .001; with a 95\%
   confidence interval of 0.113-0.274) in favor of the flipped classroom
   instructional strategy. The effect size data were normally distributed
   and exhibited statistically significant heterogeneity. The effect sizes
   were significantly moderated by subject area such as mathematics,
   science, social sciences, engineering, arts and humanities, health, and
   business. No evidence of publication bias was detected in these data. A
   full discussion of the findings and implications for educational
   practice and research were provided.},

Abstract = {This paper shows the process of research and design of learning
   materials for flipped classrooms, an active teaching method that intends
   to switch from the traditional acquisition of content in class and to
   the assignments' resolution at home. In order to choose the content to
   be addressed, we based our efforts on a research that indicated
   ``Genetics{''} as a subject of difficult comprehension. With the use of
   digital platforms, some flashcards, quizzes, mind maps, video and a
   website were produced to create the materials and promote the flipped
   classroom values. It is intended to show that the flipped classroom is
   an applicable approach, placing students at the center of the learning
   process.},

   environment include increased flexibility in learning; enhanced
   engagement with content and; more confident participation in
   face-to-face workshops. In addition, the analysis further illustrates
   that international students intrinsically develop soft skills (e.g.
   increased confidence and communication skills), learning skills (e.g.
   research and critical thinking) and employability skills (e.g. time
   management and accountability). Research limitations/implications -
   These findings focus only on the positive learning experiences of
   undergraduate international students in one Australian university.
   Originality/value The study contributes to the literature by identifying
   learning experiences of undergraduate international students in a
   flipped classroom environment and the connection with their development
   of soft skills, learning skills and employability skills.},

Abstract = {The aim of this research is to present a successful flipped classroom
   proposal in higher education to better understand its influence in terms
   of knowledge, skills and engagement. The reason why we focus on these
   three dimensions is because of their core roles in the international
   learning conceptual frameworks presented above to increase the
   employability of Generation Z students in the digital society of the
   21st century. In doing so, first, we first develop a measurement scale
   (4D\_FLIPPED) to explore the degree of flipped classroom presence in our
   higher education learning experience. Then, we present a structural
   equation model to analyze the causal relationships of knowledge, skills,
   and engagement with students' satisfaction. The empirical results point
   out that there are four fundamental dimensions that should be present in
   the flipped classroom to be successful in the 21st century with
   Generation Z. This study also confirms that the flipped classroom has
   positive effects on students' knowledge, skills, and engagement. Our
   research provides useful recommendations and insights for academia.},

Abstract = {This paper investigates the effectiveness of the flipped classroom
   methodology to build conceptual knowledge mental models. In particular,
   it examines the learning process and outcomes of 40 students of a course
   on Physical Electronics in the last year of a bachelor's degree program
   in Physics, for which specific educational resources have been developed
   to implement the flipped classroom. Among them, non-interactive
   resources are better to present topics and ideas, whereas interactive
   resources are more useful to establish links between them to build and
   check the models. The examined data entail grades, laboratory reports
   and rubrics, outcomes of learning activities, and direct observation,
   showing that the flipped classroom improves the construction of mental
   models, providing teaching resources where the topics and main ideas are
   presented, developed and exercised, and allowing students to establish
   links to build and check the models. Furthermore, this strategy
   increases the personal commitment of the students, fostering autonomy
   and cooperation with peers, all of which makes it an effective
   pedagogical tool to build knowledge mental models.},

Abstract = {Background Modern innovative education approaches are crucial for
   nursing education, which leads to improving evidence-based teaching
   strategies and preparing nursing students for their future workplaces.
   The primary aim of the study was a comparison of the effectiveness of
   the flipped classroom and traditional educational methods on the
   attainment of knowledge regarding venous thromboembolism (VTE)
   prevention among nursing students. In addition, investigation of the
   opinions of the nursing students regarding the advantages and
   disadvantages flipped classroom educational method was the secondary aim
   of the study.
   Methods This study was implemented with a randomized controlled design
   in the Faculty of Nursing in September and October 2019, with 118 first-
   and second-semester undergraduate nursing students (58 students in the
   flipped classroom, 60 students in the traditional lecture) who had not
   taken the Adult Health Nursing course. Implementation of the study was
   conducted in three phases: pretest, educational intervention, and
   posttest for both groups.
   Results The study findings demonstrated no statistically significant
   difference in any of the mean scores of VTE domains between the two
   groups in the pretest. However, the flipped classroom group had higher
   mean scores of all VTE domains compared with the traditional lecture
   group in the posttest. Mostly, students highlighted four advantages of
   the flipped classroom, including ``Deep motive,{''} ``Engagement,{''}
   ``Cost-effectiveness,{''} and ``Self-confidence.{''}
   Conclusions The flipped classroom method proved to have positive effects
   in VTE domains in terms of knowledge, risk assessment, and prophylaxis
   among nursing students. This method can be recommended as an innovative
   and student-centered method in the teaching of evidence-based nursing
   practices.},

Abstract = {This study aimed to investigate the impact of a flipped classroom on the
   self-regulated learning (SRL) and academic achievement of seventh-grade
   junior high school students. A quantitative approach was used to compare
   the traditional and flipped classroom approaches. The data were obtained
   using the Motivated Strategies for Learning Questionnaire (MSLQ) along
   with students achievement scores. Cognitive learning strategies and
   metacognitive self-regulation strategies were investigated as indicators
   of students SRL strategies. The results indicated that 64 seventh-grade
   participants demonstrated a good-to-high level of practicing SRL within
   the flipped classroom environment. Moreover, the student participants
   appeared to self-regulate their metacognitive learning strategies in the
   flipped classroom environment more than those in the traditional
   learning environment. In terms of their academic achievement, no
   statistically significant difference was detected between the
   traditional and flipped classrooms. Associations between the students
   SRL and academic achievement were identified, and several implications
   and recommendations were derived.},

Abstract = {This study presents a large-scale systematic review of the literature on
   the flipped classroom, with the goals of examining its reported
   advantages and challenges for both students and instructors, and to note
   potentially useful areas of future research on the flipped model's in
   and out-of-class activities. The full range of Social Sciences Citation
   Indexed journals was surveyed through the Web of Science site, and a
   total of 71 research articles were selected for the review. The findings
   reveal that the most frequently reported advantage of the flipped
   classroom is the improvement of student learning performance. We also
   found a number of challenges in this model. The majority of these are
   related to out-of-class activities, such as much reported inadequate
   student preparation prior to class. Several other challenges and the
   numerous advantages of the flipped classroom are discussed in detail. We
   then offer suggestions for future research on flipped model activities.},

Abstract = {A small private online course (SPOC) supports blended learning on a
   small scale, enabling students to have a more comprehensive and deeper
   learning experience. It also provides instructors with a flexible and
   feasible model to better understand the students' learning needs and to
   supervise students' learning behaviors. In this study, we adopted SPOC
   flipped classroom blended teaching in the physiology course for clinical
   undergraduate students of Kunming Medical University. Compared with the
   control group {[}lecture-based learning (LBL)], the SPOC flipped
   classroom method significantly increased the scores of students in the
   preclass test (65.13 +/- 12.45 vs. 53.46 +/- 8.09, SPOC vs. LBL) and
   postclass test (80.43 +/- 14.29 vs. 69.01 +/- 12.81, SPOC vs. LBL),
   which is induced by students' increased interest in self-learning. More
   importantly, the significant difference between the preclass scores of
   the two groups suggested that the video lecture-based preview is more
   effective than the textbook-based preview. The study indicated that the
   SPOC flipped classroom was effective in enhancing the examination scores
   of students, reflecting an improved learning efficiency and a deeper
   understanding of the knowledge. In summary, the flipped classroom based
   on SPOC improves learning outcomes compared with LBL and has a wide
   application in the learning of basic medical courses.},

Title = {Comparative Analysis of Effectiveness Between Flipped Classroom and
   Lecture-Based Classroom in Undergraduate Medical Education at Alfaisal
   University},

Abstract = {Objective
   The effectiveness of the flipped classroom is currently debated due to
   conflicting results from different studies. It is therefore important to
   evaluate its usefulness each time it is applied in a new setting. Thus,
   this study was conducted with the objective of evaluating the
   effectiveness and acceptability of the flipped classroom in
   undergraduate medical education al the College of Medicine, Alfaisal
   University.
   Methods
   This was a quasi-experimental study consisting of development and
   administration of a flipped classroom with one group of students
   receiving the flipped classroom (FG) and the other group with the
   traditional lecture-based teaching (LG). We compared the pre-university
   enrolment Cumulative Grade Point Average (CGPA), preceding progress test
   results and previous semester performance for the two groups, which
   showed no statistical difference.
   Results
   Since the FG had received the video lecture while the LG had not, there
   was a clear statistical difference between the groups with FG showing
   better performance in pre-test scores. The post-test performances were
   marginally not statistically different between FG and LG groups.
   Conclusion
   Our results did not show any long-term benefit of a flipped classroom in
   terms of retention of knowledge as manifested by grades obtained in
   midterm and final examinations. It was also not received positively by
   the students.},

Abstract = {A flipped classroom approach is a teaching/learning strategy and mode in
   which the inclass direct teacher instructing and the out-of-class
   students homework are switched. Previous studies have mostly used
   undergraduates as their participants, less of them used K-12 students;
   and used flipped classrooms in the teaching of core subjects, while
   studies of the flipped classroom for humanities cultivation are few. The
   present study has develop a brainstorming flipped classroom approach for
   civics education, in which the design was that the students read the
   course content before class and then the teacher guided the class
   discussions with the 635 brainstorming approach. The present study
   recruited 56 junior high school students and implemented a
   quasiexperiment for a civics course over a period of 6 weeks; the
   experimental group used the brainstorming flipped classroom approach,
   and the control group used the direct teaching instruction approach. The
   results show that the flipped classroom can effectively increase the
   students' performance, learning motivation for civics, citizen
   participation, better teacher-student interactions, peer interactions,
   and creativity than the control group. While the students are still able
   to acquire the basic knowledge required for the civics course. The brain
   storming flipped classroom approach developed by present study is not
   only a help to teaching of civic education, but also provides a firm
   structure for course design and pre-class learning for the whole
   learning process. The 635 brainstorming flipped classroom approach has
   pedagogical use in teaching practice and can be applied in many
   subjects.},

Abstract = {Flipped classroom has received much attention in medical education. The
   aim of this study was to evaluate the efficacy of flipped classroom
   combing with human anatomy web-based learning system in anatomy
   education. A total of 89 freshmen in medical specialty were enrolled and
   randomly allocated into either the experimental group (receiving the
   flipped classroom with human anatomy web-based learning system, n = 45)
   or control group (receiving the traditional classroom teaching, n = 44).
   A pre-quiz and a post-quiz were conducted before and after the classes,
   respectively. The improvement in scores between groups was compared. A
   5-point Likert scale questionnaire was used to evaluate perceptions and
   experience. The mean pre-quiz scores of the 2 groups were comparable
   (all P > .05). However, the mean post-quiz score in the experimental
   group was significantly higher than that in the control group (91.44 +/-
   6.25 vs 86.13 +/- 11.67, P < .05). The results of questionnaires showed
   that 44 (97.8\%) students agreed with flipped classroom combined with
   human anatomy web-based learning system, 43 (95.6\%) students obtained
   improved study interest in anatomy learning, and 42 (93.3\%) students
   felt that the interactive, applied in-class activities during the class
   greatly enhanced their learning. Flipped classroom combined with human
   anatomy web-based learning system can be used as an effective learning
   tool for anatomy education.},

Abstract = {With advances in technology and the advent of social media and social
   networking sites, the way medical education is taught to millennials
   must evolve. The ``flipped classroom,{''} which occurs when students are
   exposed to learning materials before their assigned face-to-face class
   or didactic session, can help engage all learning styles. A flipped
   classroom paired with simulation-based medical education (SBME) engages
   millennial learners to acquire the large amount of information required
   in osteopathic medical school. Using this paired approach in osteopathic
   medical education can help students meet the requirements outlined by
   the Accreditation Council for Graduate Medical Education (ACGME). With
   the single accreditation system for graduate medical education,
   finalizing in 2020, this article proposes mandating a flipped classroom
   with SBME to better prepare osteopathic medical students for their
   training in ACGME-accredited programs.},

Abstract = {Appropriate collaborative learning support is necessary for group
   learning in a flipped classroom setting, especially in the out-of-class
   learning phase. This study involved a collaborative mind mapping
   strategy to engage learners in group activities in the flipped classroom
   setting. A pilot experiment was conducted to examine the effect of such
   a strategy on students' learning achievement, self-efficacy, motivation,
   and acceptance of mind mapping in a news photography course.
   Specifically, this study compared the effects of two mind mapping
   strategies (collaborative vs. individual) combined with instructional
   methods (flipped classroom vs. conventional) on students' learning
   outcomes. A 2 x 2 mixed-factorial experiment design was used, with the
   mind mapping strategies as the within-subjects factors and the
   instructional methods as the between-subjects factors. Ninety-two
   sophomores enrolled in this course were randomly assigned to either
   flipped classroom or conventional lecturing. Both method groups used
   collaborative and individual mind mapping. Results revealed that the
   combination of a collaborative mind mapping strategy and a flipped
   classroom significantly improved students' learning achievement and
   self-efficacy. In addition, flipped classroom students had a more
   positive attitude toward accepting and using collaborative mind mapping
   than those in the individual mind mapping condition. These implications
   provided instructional designers guidance to apply collaborative mind
   mapping into a flipped classroom and suggested that designers should
   focus on improving students' motivation by integrating other strategies.},

Title = {The effects of flipped classroom characterized by situational and
   collaborative learning in a community nursing course: A
   quasi-experimental design},
Journal = {NURSE EDUCATION TODAY},

Abstract = {Background: Since traditional teaching could not help to develop
   competences, flipped classroom has caught the sight of researchers.
   Despite the uptake of flipped classroom in other disciplines, there is a
   dearth of evidence available about the use in nursing curricula. In
   addition, there is no consensus on how to best implement a flipped
   classroom. Objective: This study aimed to (1) develop a flipped
   classroom underpinned by constructivism theory and (2) to verify its
   effectiveness. Design: This study adopted a quasi-experimental design.
   Setting and participants: This study was conducted in 2018 spring
   semester at a University in East China with 6th semester undergraduate
   nursing students in four parallel classes in Community Nursing Course.
   Methods: A flipped classroom characterized by situational and
   collaborative learning was developed and carried out with two classes
   (intervention group, n = 98). In-class lectures was applied for the
   other two classes (control group, n = 90). Course examination score,
   experience (course experience questionnaire, CEQ), and students'
   appraisal were used to verify the effectiveness of flipped classroom.
   Results: Compared to control group, the examination score was higher for
   intervention group. As for the four domains of CEQ, good teaching domain
   rating was lower, learning burden domain rating was higher for the
   intervention group. There was no statistical difference in classroom
   quality and harvest domains. More students in intervention group chose
   the course helped them in developing ``critical thinking{''} and
   ``self-cognition and evaluation{''} abilities. Satisfaction rating of
   groups was not statistically different. Conclusions: Flipped classroom
   was efficient in improving students' academic performance and promoting
   development of higher-level thinking abilities; however, it failed in
   improving students' satisfaction and course experience. These findings
   suggest that active learning strategies such as situational and
   collaborative learning of group problem solving and discussion should be
   integrated into nursing curriculum and refinement to flipped classroom
   are needed to create students' buy-in.},

Abstract = {This study analyses the use of a flipped classroom to develop the
   `learning to learn' competence in the university context. This research
   was conducted on a subject about Applied Teaching Methodology included
   in the Physical Activity and Sports Science degree at the Polytechnic
   University of Madrid (Spain). A total of 110 university students (mean
   age 21.6 +/- 3.0 years) participated in the research and were divided
   into two groups: one group (44 students) received an intervention based
   on the traditional method (with theoretical classes and resolved
   questions) and the other group (66 students) received an intervention
   using the flipped classroom method; self-perception of the level of
   development of the `learning to learn' competence was analysed before
   and after the intervention. The design involved two groups that followed
   different types of teaching (traditional vs. flipped classroom) x two
   moments in time (before and after).
   This study did not find any significant differences between the
   traditional and flipped classroom method, in the perception of the
   development of the `learning to learn' competence.},

Abstract = {The purpose of this study is to examine the effect of student
   satisfaction on students' engagement and motivation in a mobile-based
   flipped classroom. A total of 222 university students taking the
   Computing I course designed as a mobile-based flipped classroom were
   recruited. Data were collected through three self-report instruments:
   the Satisfaction Scale, Students' Engagement Scale and Motivation Scale.
   Path analyses with structural equation modelling further verified that
   students' satisfaction was related to their engagement and motivation
   while performing academic tasks in the mobile-based flipped classroom.
   Results suggest that students' satisfaction and its sub-dimensions
   `communication and usability', `teaching process', `instructional
   content', as well as `interaction and evaluation', are significant
   predictors of students' engagement and motivation in the mobile-based
   flipped classroom. Based on the findings, recommendations are proposed
   for instructors, instructional designers and researchers in terms of
   increasing students' engagement and motivation in a mobile-based flipped
   classroom.},

Abstract = {The continuous social and epistemological changes brought by
   globalization have resulted in a plurality of concepts to denominate the
   postmodern society - invaded by technological and scientific advances
   with uncontrollable speed. Consequently, this reality reflects in the
   educational context that urges for changes, aggregations and
   transformations in teaching practices, and the English teaching is not
   excluded from this reality. The active methodologies, more specifically
   the flipped classroom model, have cooperated for these innovations to
   occur. The present report deals with the contributions of the active
   methodologies and the experiences of the flipped classroom as a modality
   of the hybrid teaching, emphasizing its application in English teaching.
   It presents the experiences developed in a language school with
   pre-intermediate level students in the city of Patos-PB. In a central
   way, this research aimed to identify the contributions brought by the
   flipped classroom proposal to learn the English language and to know the
   possible challenges for the implementation of this methodology. The
   theoretical anchorage that underlies the understanding of the
   contributions of digital technologies and of the flipped classroom
   proposal is found in Bergamn and Sams (2016), Valente (2017), Monte Mar
   (2010), Horn and Staker (2015), among others.},

Abstract = {Along with the deepening and reform of piano teaching, piano teaching
   resources have been optimized and integrated. The application of
   Internet technology provides a new opportunity for piano teaching mode
   and talents training in colleges and universities. Mooc teaching breaks
   the traditional teaching mode of group class and collective class, and
   flipped classroom can expand the piano subject practice. Based on the
   network technology, this study explores the application of the teaching
   mode of Mooc-based flipped classroom in the teaching reform of piano
   course. The results show that the teaching method of Mooc improves the
   ability of resources sharing, liberalization and teaching according to
   students' aptitude of piano teaching. The production of Mooc-based
   flipped classroom makes Internet knowledge and the dissemination of
   teaching break spacetime limit. Mooc platform is easier for students to
   apply their abilities to practical application. This study provides idea
   and platform for the combination of piano teaching and Internet in
   colleges and universities.},

Abstract = {In May 2019, the World Health Assembly, in an unprecedented move,
   endorsed the inclusion of traditional medicine in the International
   Classification of Diseases, 11th Revision. In Japan, traditional
   medicine (known as Kampo) is regulated by the government and prescribed
   by over 90\% of physicians along with modern medicine under the national
   health insurance system. Although Kampo education must be included in
   Japan's core medical curricula, there are significant challenges to
   implementation. In the educational context, the flipped classroom
   teaching method has received considerable attention in recent years.
   This study developed a Kampo e-learning program and verified the
   effectiveness of a flipped classroom using Kampo e-learning. The Kampo
   e-learning Committee determined three courses and assigned an
   administrator for each. The administrators appointed lecturers who
   developed Kampo e-learning lessons. Physicians, pharmacists, medical
   students, and pharmacy students were asked to participate in the
   e-learning program, and their comments and suggestions were collected
   after program completion. The flipped classroom was evaluated by
   implementing Kampo e-learning in the Kampo session with fourth-year
   students at Keio University School of Medicine in Japan. Seven courses
   were created, including four based on volunteer suggestions. The
   `Systematic Kampo Curricula' featured 88 lessons developed by 54 Kampo
   specialists. Out of 118 fourth-year medical students who participated in
   the flipped classroom, 113 registered for the Kampo e-learning program,
   100 attended the session, and 88 answered the post-session
   questionnaire. Among the students who answered the questionnaire, 86.4\%
   were satisfied with the flipped classroom, 79.5\% replied that the
   program made them understand Kampo and 80.7\% stated that it should be
   adopted. The flipped classroom using Kampo e-learning program was shown
   to be attractive in one medical school. Further expanded study is
   necessary in the near future to reveal the usefulness of the flipped
   classroom of Kampo learning.},

Abstract = {The educational transformation of flipped classroom continues to be the
   important approach to increasing students' readiness for flipped
   learning. To successfully implement the flipped classroom, students'
   readiness to use the materials delivered to them in the pre-class
   session and parent-school involvement should be part of the process to
   improve this student-centered learning approach. However, little is
   known concerning the assessment of students' readiness to learn through
   the WBI in a flipped classroom and the role of parent-school involvement
   in student-centered learning approach. Hence, this study aims to extend
   the UTAUT model by considering the experience expectancy, parent-school
   involvement, perceived behaviour control and perceived self-efficacy
   factors to investigate high school students' acceptance of WBI for
   flipped classroom (FC) approach. A total of 320 senior high school
   students in English Literature class were selected for the study using
   structured equation modelling to analyse the survey questionnaire data.
   The results revealed that performance expectancy, effort expectancy,
   parent-school involvement, perceived self-efficacy and experience
   expectancy have positive influence on students' behavioural intention to
   use WBI. Also, this current study identified that, the perceived
   behavioral control has an insignificant effect on students' behavioral
   intention to use WBI for FC approach. Detailed results and educational
   implications are discussed.},

Abstract = {Introduction: Pedagogical constructs such as flipped classroom are used
   to engage students in the learning process by their active
   participation. The aim of the present study was to compare the two
   models of flipped classroom and traditional lecture in training
   undergraduates in pediatric epilepsy. Methods: The study was conducted
   among the 3rd-year undergraduate medical students. They were divided to
   either of Group I or II. Pediatric epilepsy was taught in two parts
   (clinical diagnosis and management). Group I received Part A as
   traditional lecture and Part B as the flipped classroom and the reverse
   for Group II. The difference in posttest and pretest scores was compared
   between two groups for each part. Results: There was a significant
   increase in posttest scores when compared to pretest scores in both the
   groups. Mean (standard deviation {[}SD]) difference in scores for
   epilepsy diagnosis was comparable in Group I (3.33 {[}2.3]) and Group II
   (2.46 {[}2.17]) (P = 0.16). Mean (SD) difference in scores for epilepsy
   management was significantly higher in Group I (3.41 {[}2.09]) when
   compared to Group II (1.30 {[}1.84]) (P < 0.01). Conclusion: Flipped
   classroom model resulted in better scores than the traditional teaching
   method for training undergraduates in the management of epilepsy in
   children. This teaching-learning method could be adopted in training of
   primary care physicians.},

Abstract = {In the current study, the aim is to determine the effect of flipped
   classroom model on students' classroom engagement in teaching English.
   This research was conducted within the English course for four weeks
   period in the Spring term in 2016-2017 school year in a secondary school
   in the city of Hatay. In the study, pretest/post-test quasi-experimental
   design with control group was applied. The experimental group was
   lectured with flipped classroom model whereas the courses were carried
   out based on the current curriculum in the control group. In the current
   study, descriptive statistics, Mann Whitney U Test and Wilcoxon Sign
   Test were used in the analysis of the quantitative data. It was
   concluded that there is a significant difference between the pre-test
   and post-test scores of the experimental group whearas there is no
   significant difference between the pre-test and post-test scores of the
   control group. Finally, teachers can be suggested to use flipped
   classroom model to enhance classroom engagement.},

Abstract = {As a student-centered learning model, flipped classroom has been
   increasingly preferred among educators since it has changed the
   traditional teacher-centered learning model. This study conducted
   experiments and observations on the flipped classroom for digital logic
   courses for first-year students in the electrical engineering department
   of a junior college in Taiwan. Before each class, these students were
   required to watch the prescribed lecture video units. In class, students
   discussed with group members after thinking and completed the teacher's
   requirements by collaboration. In addition to conducting the activities
   of thinking, discussion, collaboration and observation, these students
   also got to exercise their expression skills through interactive
   activities during class time. Analyzing the learning effectiveness with
   the Panel Data Method (PDM), this study, by comparing and statistically
   analyzing the data collected during the four years between 2016 and
   2019, found that students reaped better learning performance with the
   flipped classroom model, as shown by a rise in both their average grade
   and the pass rate.},

Abstract = {Numerous studies have been conducted to date on the effectiveness of the
   flipped classroom. However, the results of studies reporting on the
   model are generally inconsistent. The aim of this research was to
   evaluate the results of these primary studies in a comprehensive manner,
   and to obtain general results to document the effectiveness of flipped
   classroom, also expose the impact of various study characteristics on
   this effect. To this end, a meta-analysis of primary studies examining
   the impact of flipped classroom on academic achievement, learning
   retention and attitude towards course was conducted. 177 studies for the
   academic achievement, 9 studies for the learning retention and 17
   studies for the attitude towards course variables that meet the
   inclusion criteria were coded and analyzed. Additionally, moderator
   analyses were conducted for 8 possible moderator variables. The results
   of the analysis indicated a moderate main effect size for the
   effectiveness of flipped classroom on academic achievement (g = 0.764)
   and learning retention (g = 0.601) also a modest main effect size on
   attitude towards course (g = 0.406). Through to this meta-analysis we
   have learned that in terms of academic achievement the flipped classroom
   phenomenon; (a) has been implemented more effectively in small classes,
   (b) has been applied most effectively in primary schools, (c) its
   effectiveness has decreased as the duration of implementation extends,
   (d) has been implemented effectively in almost all domain subjects, (e)
   also in terms of attitude towards course and learning retention it has
   been more effective than traditional lecture-based instruction.},

Abstract = {This study aimed to investigate the impact of the flipped classroom
   model on students' self-efficacy and the difference in self-efficacy
   between males and females using this model. In order to accomplish this,
   66 advanced participants were selected from a private English language
   institute. They were divided into two equal groups, namely experimental
   (flipped classroom) and control (traditional) group. The students'
   self-efficacy was scored before and after the intervention with the
   Self-Efficacy Survey. The results indicated an increase in their average
   self-efficacy score with the flipped classroom while the traditional
   classroom decreased their average score. When the genders were analyzed
   separately, the males demonstrated a decrease in self-efficacy while the
   females indicated an increase while utilizing the flipped classroom. In
   light of these results, some recommendations have been made.},

Abstract = {The proposal of the flipped classroom is that the student has the first
   contact with the content through pre-class activities. The classroom
   becomes the place to clarify doubts and deepen knowledge in practical
   activities such as problem solving, projects and group discussion. This
   article presents a literature review that aims to reflect on the flipped
   classroom as an active methodology and the changes and impacts of its
   use for the teaching and learning process. It is concluded that the
   purpose of the flipped classroom is to favor a better use of time and
   space in the classroom, encouraging the active student, with reflective
   thinking and greater interaction between students and between them and
   the teacher This can lead to positive impacts, such as greater
   conceptual understanding, development of critical thinking and reducing
   the number of failures. On the other hand, negative points may arise,
   such as an increase in the number of hours of previous study and the
   student's difficulty in adapting to the logic of inversion of classes.},

Abstract = {The flipped-classroom approach has gained increasing popularity and
   interest in engineering education. The purpose of this study was to
   investigate (a) student perspectives on the flipped-classroom approach
   in a transportation-engineering course and (b) how students used the
   in-class time dedicated to collaborative problem solving. To this end,
   the study adopted a mixed-methods approach. Quantitative data included
   an end-of-semester survey and student course grades. Qualitative data
   included information from focus-group interviews with students and video
   recordings that demonstrated selected groups' problem-solving processes.
   The results indicated that students found their flipped-classroom
   experience to be generally positive. Students were shown to engage in
   five types of behaviors during collaborative problem solving: problem
   analysis or understanding, individually working on problems, comparing
   individual work, interacting with peers, and interacting with the
   instructor.},

Abstract = {The flipped classroom has become a fundamental methodological option in
   recent years to provide more personalized education opportunities. The
   aim of this study is to investigate the academic performance and the
   perception of the students on the flipped classroom model (FCM) in a
   course of Didactics of Music in Childhood Education. One of the two
   groups enrolled in this subject received a quarter of classroom hours. A
   total of 51 students were selected by means of convenience random
   sampling, who were divided during a semester into an experimental group
   (n = 24, flipped classroom methodology) and a control group (n = 27,
   traditional methodology). Using ANOVA and ANCOVA models and cumulative
   ordinal categorical models with various functions of the statistical
   software R, the results indicate that the group has studied under a
   traditional methodology showed statistically significant differences in
   the variables of learning climate, self-efficacy and cognitive
   commitment, but with no impact on academic performance. Students who
   have studied under the flipped classroom model achieved higher academic
   performance globally. At the end of the study, the results obtained in
   the light of other similar investigations are discussed.},

Abstract = {The integration of new technologies in the educational field have
   strengthened the development of new pedagogical strategies such as the
   flipped classroom, in which self-regulated and active learning are
   fostered. Considering the advantages of this methodology, a strategy
   based on the flipped classroom was designed to develop the
   ``convolution{''} topic in the subject of Signals and Systems I of the
   Universidad Nacional de Colombia. The strategy was implemented with 90
   students. After the strategy implementation, students reported their
   perceptions towards the flipped classroom methodology and the
   educational resources proposed to support the strategy development.
   According to the results, students had an overall positive perception in
   relation to the methodology and the educational resources proposed.
   However, suggestions for improvement of the educational resources and
   considerations about logistic elements, were made by some students.},

Title = {Intelligent Learning Algorithm for English Flipped Classroom Based on
   Recurrent Neural Network},
Journal = {WIRELESS COMMUNICATIONS \& MOBILE COMPUTING},
Year = {2021},
Volume = {2021},
Month = {SEP 13},
Abstract = {Reading and writing are the foundations of English learning as well as
   an important method of instruction. With the advancement of network
   technology and the onset of the information age, an increasing number of
   students have lost interest in traditional English reading and writing
   instruction in the classroom. Flipped classrooms have emerged as a
   result of this situation and have become the focus of research in one
   fell swoop. As a result, flipped classroom research at home and abroad
   has primarily focused on the theory and practical application of flipped
   classrooms, and flipped classroom application practice is primarily
   based on the overall classroom, with few separate discussions on the
   effects of flipped classroom students' self-learning. As a result, we
   developed a recurrent neural network-based intelligent assisted learning
   algorithm for English flipped classrooms. There are two main
   characteristics of the model. First, it is a gated recurrent unit based
   on a variant structure of the recurrent neural network. The
   double-gating mechanism fully considers the context and selects memory
   through weight assignment, and on this basis, it integrates the novel
   LeakyReLU function to improve the model's training convergence
   efficiency. Second, by overcoming time-consuming problems in the medium,
   the adoption of the connection sequence classification algorithm
   eliminates the need for prior alignment of speech and text data,
   resulting in a direct boost in model training speed. The experimental
   results show that in the English flipped classroom's intelligent
   learning mode, students explore and discover knowledge independently,
   their enthusiasm and interest in learning are greatly increased, and the
   flipped classroom's teaching effect is greatly improved.},

Abstract = {The present study was conducted to investigate the use of a flipped
   classroom in primary EFL classrooms in China. It is quasi-experimental
   research examining flipped and non-flipped classrooms in teaching
   English vowel letters in a primary school in China. Specifically, the
   researchers aimed at finding out the participating students' and
   teachers' perceptions towards the flipped classroom approach, whether it
   could be an approach for making students more engaged in their learning,
   and if it could enhance students' learning. Four classes of Primary 4
   students (the flipped classroom approach was adopted in two classes and
   a traditional teacher-instructed method was used in the other two
   classes) were involved. Students in the two flipped classes learnt the
   English vowel letters by watching lecture videos before face-to-face
   lessons. On the other hand, students in the two non-flipped classes
   learnt the five vowel letters through a teacher-instructed approach in
   face-to-face lessons. Before the implementation of the study, a pre-test
   was administered to the students to find out their background knowledge.
   At the end of the study, a post-test was conducted to see if there was
   any gain in the scores obtained by the students. Qualitative data were
   also collected by eliciting opinions about the flipped classroom
   approach from the participating students and teachers. Implications for
   teaching and further research are drawn at the end of this paper.},

Abstract = {Background: This study aims to evaluate the feasibility, acceptability,
   and effectiveness of massive open online courses (MOOCs) in combination
   with flipped classroom teaching in the standard training of resident
   physicians (resident physician trainees).
   Methods: A total of 110 resident physician trainees enrolled in 2018,
   with a major in Internal Medicine, were selected and divided into a
   control group (n = 55) who experienced traditional teaching methods and
   an experimental group (n = 55) who experienced MOOCs plus flipped
   classroom teaching. Their post-class test scores and satisfaction
   questionnaires were compared.
   Results: The test scores (80.60 +/- 7.65) of resident physician trainees
   in the experimental group were higher than those of the control group
   (77.05 +/- 8.08), and the difference was statistically significant (P <
   0.05). The experimental group trainees were highly satisfied with the
   MOOC + flipped classroom program.
   Conclusion: MOOCs in combination with flipped classroom teaching can
   increase the effectiveness of teaching in the standard training for
   resident physicians and trainees' comprehensive clinical diagnosis and
   treatment ability.},

Abstract = {The major purpose of this study is to investigate the impact of flipped
   classroom on pre-service English teachers' Advanced Writing achievement.
   The study also aims at exploring whether flipped classroom approach
   makes a difference, if any, on the self-regulated learning of the
   participants. The participants of this study were selected by
   convenience sampling method and consisted of fifty-five (N=55)
   pre-service ELT teachers attending Advanced Writing course and studying
   at English Language Teaching Department (ELT) at a foundation university
   in the fall semester of 2017-2018 academic year. Two intact classes were
   selected as control (N=28) and experimental group (N=27). The control
   group was exposed to traditional lecture based instruction, whereas the
   experimental group received the flipped classroom approach. In this
   quasi-experimental study, data were gathered through pre-post-tests of
   advanced writing and self-regulated learning scale. Mixed ANOVA analysis
   was used for data analysis. The obtained results demonstrated that the
   implementation of flipped classroom approach resulted in better writing
   achievement, yet self-regulated learning showed no significant
   difference between groups. Based on these findings, the study provides
   pedagogical implications and suggestions for integrating flipped
   classroom approach in the undergraduate programs.},

Abstract = {The aim of this investigation was for students to express their views on
   teaching approaches delivered by two teachers under the perspectives of
   Higher Order Thinking Skills (HOTS) development, their preferences on
   learning material and learning activities. First year psychology
   students followed both the traditional and a flipped classroom approach
   delivered by two different teachers. One teacher introduced them to
   social and the other to clinical psychology. 81 students evaluated their
   experience on social psychology and 119 students on clinical psychology.
   Although all students had similar preferences on following either the
   traditional or the flipped classroom approach in both subject domains, a
   significant difference in students' views related to the teachers'
   contribution to teaching approach, students' HOTS development and the
   choice of learning material was observed. This investigation concluded
   the importance of the intricate relationship between the choice of
   learning material and activities, and the teacher's contribution to the
   flipped classroom approach and their expectation/behaviour toward
   technology.},

Title = {A cross-sectional, mixed methods examination of a modified `Flipped
   Classroom' pedagogy: The `Sandwich Approach'},
Journal = {JOURNAL OF INTERACTIONAL RESEARCH IN COMMUNICATION DISORDERS},

Abstract = {The `Flipped Classroom' has garnered much popularity as an instructional
   pedagogy over the past several years. At times, popular press and less
   empirical descriptions have superseded data driven descriptions of the
   technique. Further, many of the publications, which describe the flipped
   classroom approach, provide limited information about implementation or
   a vague overview of the principle. Nonetheless, the approach has thrived
   and is used broadly given gains in engagement and academic performance
   reported in a few key investigations. Several shortcomings have been
   identified but not evaluated systematically, in terms of potential
   solutions. This paper attempts to summarize previous empirical research
   findings, describe a modified version of the pedagogy referred to as the
   `sandwich approach', and provide detailed information regarding
   implementation. A multi-year, cross-sectional, and mixed
   qualitative-quantitative design was employed to analyze comparisons of
   traditional versus flipped versus sandwich pedagogies in an
   undergraduate neuroanatomy course. Variables included student
   performance, influence of each pedagogy on student confidence, and
   student perceptions regarding each pedagogy. In quantitative comparisons
   of final grades, the sandwich approach out-performed traditional
   instruction. Student confidence ratings were generally better in the
   flipped contexts, as opposed to traditional. Qualitative analyses
   compared barriers and facilitators across pedagogies. Perceived barriers
   were highest for the flipped classroom approach, whereas barriers were
   lowest for the sandwich pedagogy and facilitators were the highest for
   the sandwich approach. Previous evidence suggested that the flipped
   classroom approach improved grade performance but was perceived less
   favorably by students. The sandwich approach appears to improve grade
   performance at a level equivalent or exceeding flipped classroom
   approach, while improving student perceptions. Since student perceptions
   are likely related to their motivation and engagement, addressing
   concerns identified in previous research regarding student perceptions
   within the flipped classroom approach is an important finding.},

Title = {Exploring the pedagogical design features of the flipped classroom in
   undergraduate nursing education: a systematic review},
Journal = {BMC NURSING},

Abstract = {Background In recent years, technological advancement has enabled the
   use of blended learning approaches, including flipped classrooms.
   Flipped classrooms promote higher-order knowledge application - a key
   component of nursing education. This systematic review aims to evaluate
   the empirical evidence and refereed literature pertaining to the
   development, application and effectiveness of flipped classrooms in
   reference to undergraduate nursing education. Methods A PRISMA
   systematic review protocol was implemented to investigate the literature
   pertaining to the development, implementation and effectiveness of
   flipped classroom pedagogy in undergraduate nursing education. Seven
   databases (Scopus, PsycINFO, CINAHL, ERIC, MEDLINE, Cochrane, Web of
   Science) were utilised to survey the salient literature. Articles were
   appraised with respect to their level of evidence, the origin of study,
   study design, the aims/s of the study, and the key outcomes of the
   study. A qualitative synthesis was then conducted to summarise the study
   findings. Results The initial search identified 1263 potentially
   relevant articles. After comprehensively reviewing the initial catchment
   using several analytical phases, 27 articles were considered for the
   final review, most of which were conducted in the USA and South Korea. A
   range of research designs were applied to measure or discuss the
   outcomes and design features of the flipped classroom pedagogy when
   applied to undergraduate nursing education. The review indicated that a
   common operational flipped classroom model involves three key
   components, namely pre-classroom activities, in-classroom activities and
   post-classroom activities, guided by two instructional system design
   principles. The review predominantly identified positive learning
   outcomes among undergraduate nursing students, after experiencing the
   flipped classroom, in terms of skills, knowledge and attitudes. However,
   a few studies reported contrasting findings, possibly due to the
   incompatibility of the flipped classroom pedagogy with the traditional
   learning culture. Conclusions Current evidence in this systematic review
   suggests that incorporating the flipped classroom pedagogy could yield
   positive educational outcomes in undergraduate nursing education. There
   are promising pedagogical models available for adapting or developing
   the flipped classroom pedagogy in undergraduate nursing education.},

Abstract = {This study examines EFL students' metacognitive strategy use in a
   university flipped classroom and the underlying factors of metacognitive
   strategy use. The participants in our study were students enrolled in an
   elective English course at a university in Taiwan, where they had to
   watch online course videos outside of class and participate in
   activities that required knowledge application. Students' metacognitive
   strategy use and factors affecting their use were elicited through
   written accounts, class observations, and semi-structured interviews.
   Findings show that factors affecting their metacognitive strategy use
   include students' expected learning outcome and peer learning. Students'
   greater control over learning in a flipped classroom context further
   facilitates their metacognitive strategies. Finally, possible directions
   for metacognitive instruction are discussed.},

Abstract = {Background Although the benefits of using a flipped classroom in nursing
   education have been reported, there are few published studies attempting
   to understand students' subjective experiences with scaffolding in a
   flipped classroom and the challenges they face as a result of this type
   of educational change. The purpose of this study was to describe
   students' perspectives of scaffolding in the Flipped Classroom of the
   Fundamental Nursing Practice Course (FNPC-FC). Methods Thirty-four
   undergraduates were recruited and separated into four groups in the
   study. The data was collected through semi-structured focus group
   interviews. Thematic analysis was conducted to analyze the data in order
   to determine the themes in the interview transcriptions. Results The
   research revealed two primary themes with associated sub-themes: 1)
   challenging learning experience, and 2) teacher-student interaction.
   Conclusions Students will confront substantial challenges as scaffolding
   strategies are implemented in the flipped classroom. On the other hand,
   scaffolding in the flipped classroom can successfully train students to
   be self-directed learners and equip them with nursing skills when
   students are given appropriate support.},

Abstract = {Background The role of the flipped classroom model in graduate medical
   education (GME) is not yet defined. We set out to evaluate the
   feasibility, acceptability and outcomes of a flipped classroom
   instructional model in an internal medicine curriculum. Methods This
   pilot study was carried out in an academic medical centre in the USA
   with 43 second-year internal medicine postgraduate trainees. Trainees
   watched videos on the pharmacological treatment of type 2 diabetes
   outside of the classroom, followed by an in-class session in which they
   engaged in case-based discussions. The intervention was evaluated using
   surveys and a knowledge test before, immediately after and 6 months
   after the intervention. Results The mean number of correct answers for a
   10-question knowledge test was 5.25 before the intervention, 8.00 in the
   immediate post-intervention test, and 7.10 in the 6-month follow-up test
   (p < 0.001). Six months after the intervention, 57.1\% of participants
   reported prescribing an antidiabetic medication discussed at the
   session. In a focus group, trainees reported their preference for
   interactive, case-based learning, concern about the time required for
   preparation and interest in incorporating real patient cases. Discussion
   Trainees preferred the flipped classroom, which also resulted in
   increased knowledge and self-reported prescribing changes; however, the
   required preparatory time may limit its feasibility in GME.},

Title = {Evaluation of the College English Flipped Classroom Teaching Model Based
   on Data Mining Algorithms},
Journal = {MOBILE INFORMATION SYSTEMS},
Year = {2021},
Volume = {2021},
Month = {OCT 26},
Abstract = {Aiming at the problem of the inability to classify data due to the
   excessive amount of teaching resources, which leads to the college
   English flipped classroom teaching model's low resource sharing rate and
   the poor accuracy of score statistical analysis, a university-based data
   mining algorithm is designed. Research on the evaluation of english
   flipped classroom teaching model is conducted, the strategy of applying
   the flipped classroom in college English teaching is analyzed, the
   characteristics and advantages of this model are explored, the data
   mining algorithm to practical teaching is applied, and the decision tree
   C4.5 classification technology is used to achieve accurate
   classification of massive student test scores. The classification
   technology selects classification attributes based on the information
   gain rate. It uses the postpruning method to process data to improve the
   accuracy of data classification. Finally, the statistical analysis
   results of the business logic layer are transmitted to the user through
   the browser application layer using the WEB server. The experimental
   results show that using this article's evaluation method, the college
   English flipped classroom teaching model can achieve a high resource
   sharing rate, high accuracy of performance statistics analysis, and a
   good teaching effect.},

Abstract = {The flipped classroom is an instructional model which allows for more
   advanced learning activities during in-class time while introduces
   subject knowledge to students prior to class. To address a gap in the
   recent research regarding higher education instructors' experiences,
   perceptions and adoption decisions of the flipped classroom instruction,
   this study aimed at investigating the critical factors which were
   predictive of a higher education instructor's decision to adopt a
   flipped classroom instructional model through exploratory factor
   analysis (EFA) and multiple regression in a US university. The results
   revealed that performance expectancy and technology self-efficacy were
   significant predictors. Although facilitation condition was
   significantly correlated with instructors' adoption decisions, it was
   not a significant predictor. This study suggests that in order to
   improve higher education instructors' adoption decisions of the flipped
   classroom and other active learning instructional models, it is of
   priority for institutions to remove the internal barriers to
   instructors' adoption decisions of these instructional models, such as
   improving their performance expectancy and technology self-efficacy.},

Abstract = {Introduction: Career advising for medical students can be challenging
   for both the student and the adviser. Our objective was to design,
   implement, and evaluate a ``flipped classroom{''} style advising
   session.
   Methods: We performed a single-center cross-sectional study at an
   academic medical center, where a novel flipped classroom style student
   advising model was implemented and evaluated. In this model, students
   were provided a document to review and fill out prior to their
   one-on-one advising session.
   Results: Ninety-four percent (95\% CI, 88\%-100\%) of the medical
   students surveyed felt that the advising session was more effective as a
   result of the outline provided and completed before the session and that
   the pre-advising document helped them gain a better understanding of the
   content to be discussed at the session.
   Conclusion: Utilization of the flipped classroom style advising document
   was an engaging advising technique that was well received by students at
   our institution.},

   strategy have a direct impact on students' CTS. In addition, indirect
   effects were found between student-to-student connectedness and CTS
   through learning motivation. Indirect effects were also found between
   learning motivation and CTS through the learning strategy in a
   flipped-classroom instruction situation. The findings of this research
   have practical implications for instructors, in that they should focus
   on the key factors that predict students' computational thinking skills.},

Abstract = {We present the design and implementation of a blended learning
   environment where fundamental concepts belonging to a flipped classroom
   paradigm are applied to a project-based learning module. Several
   in-class and out-class activities are employed pivoting on the objective
   of improving students' learning experiences in an engineering
   project-connected curriculum. The key idea of this pedagogy study is to
   structure most of the theoretical aspects of the subject matter in
   pre-recorded video lectures, online media platforms, learning materials
   and quizzes. For students exposed to the hybrid Project-Based
   Learning-Flipped Classroom pedagogy, it is mandatory for them to watch
   the video lectures and partake the online quizzes before coming to
   class. Accordingly, studio classes are not spent covering theories,
   instead time is spent on discussions and small-scale engineering
   demonstrations so that students have better perspectives on the actual
   application of theories. We compared results from two classes of
   students - one is subjected to a traditional project-based learning
   while the other undergoes a hybrid Project-Based Learning-Flipped
   Classroom. Key findings have indicated a significant increase in
   fundamental formative knowledge, enhanced problem-solving abilities and
   production of better performing artefacts with regard to the set of
   design skills for students undergoing hybrid Project-Based
   Learning-Flipped Classroom. Survey results further highlighted that
   Project-Based Learning-Flipped Classroom students were highly positive
   towards achieving better project outcomes and are able to think
   critically in developing creative artefacts. As a result, these
   Project-Based Learning-Flipped Classroom students are more active in
   their learning process. This study provides a reference platform for
   educators who are seeking new directions in learning/facilitating
   strategies that complement existing methods in order to enrich the
   project-based learning experience of students.},

Abstract = {Currently, the use of technology has become one of the most popular
   educational trends in Higher Education. One of the most popular methods
   on the Higher Education stage is the Flipped Classroom, characterised by
   the use of both face-to-face and virtual teaching through videos and
   online material, promoting more autonomous, flexible and dynamic
   teaching for students. In this work, we started to compile the main
   articles that used Flipped Classroom within the mathematical area in
   Higher Education, with the aim of analysing their main characteristics,
   as well as the impact caused on students. To do so, the method of
   systematic review was used, focusing on those empirical experiences
   published in Web of Sciences and Scopus. The results indicated that, in
   most cases, the implementation of Flipped Classroom led to an
   improvement in students' knowledge and attitudes towards mathematical
   content and discipline. In addition, aspects such as collaborative work,
   autonomy, self-regulation towards learning or academic performance were
   benefited through this method.},

Abstract = {Students' learning engagement is recognized as one of the main
   components of effective instruction and a necessary prerequisite for
   learning, but students' learning engagement in flipped classroom poses
   some pedagogical challenges. This study aimed to promote students'
   learning engagement via the flipped classroom approach. Design-based
   research (DBR) was adopted in this study to conduct an experiment
   involving three iterations in a Modern Educational Technology (MET)
   course in a Chinese university. The participants included 36 third-year
   pre-service teacher undergraduates. Classroom observations and a
   learning engagement questionnaire were used to measure the effectiveness
   of the flipped instruction in terms of students' learning engagement.
   Data analysis applied descriptive statistics, ANOVA, and paired samples
   t tests. The results showed that after three rounds of iterative
   experiments, students' learning engagement (behavioral, cognitive, and
   emotional) significantly improved. Several principles are provided as
   guidelines for instructors to implement flipped classroom approach to
   promote students' learning engagement.},

Abstract = {The flipped classroom is a technique that involves a reordering of
   classroom and at-home activities. Content provided prior to classroom
   interactions is used to prepare students for face-to-face classes. The
   flipped classroom has been shown to benefit students, including
   improving examination results, and there is increasing interest in using
   it in veterinary education. The current study aimed to investigate the
   potential of the flipped classroom approach to preparing students for
   practicals in a clinical skills laboratory. An online survey was
   distributed to the international veterinary clinical skills community to
   determine the extent to which a flipped classroom is used prior to
   teaching in a clinical skills laboratory and how educators viewed the
   benefits, challenges, and possibilities. There were 101 survey
   participants representing 22 countries, and all were involved in
   clinical skills teaching; 42 were using flipped classroom techniques
   prior to teaching in a clinical skills laboratory, and 55 others would
   consider using the technique in this context in the future. Videos were
   the most common resource used. The main benefits, experienced or
   anticipated, were positive changes in student behavior, including
   preparation and better use of time during practicals by both the
   students and instructors. The main challenges were the time needed for
   instructors to develop the materials, lack of student engagement with
   the flipped classroom, space in the curriculum, and institutional
   issues. In conclusion, many potential benefits could be realized with a
   flipped classroom approach embedded prior to clinical skills laboratory
   practicals.},

   Students' Technical Communication Skills},
Journal = {JOURNAL OF CIVIL ENGINEERING EDUCATION},

Month = {JAN},
Abstract = {Because of the availability of internet resources including audio and
   video on virtually any subject, the flipped classroom is being
   increasingly used in many areas. However, the benefits of using a
   flipped classroom on the technical communication skills of construction
   students have not yet been rigorously studied. Hence, a study was
   carried out with the objective of assessing the benefits of the flipped
   classroom in enhancing construction students' technical communication
   skills. The University of Texas at Arlington's graduate-level building
   information modeling course was selected to be taught using the
   traditional lecture-based format and the flipped format in two
   consecutive semesters. Students' project report grades and presentation
   grades were used to evaluate their technical communication skills. Nine
   control variables representing students' preexisting communication
   skills, technical knowledge, and background were considered. Hypothesis
   tests were conducted to compare the grades of students in two
   consecutive semesters. The results indicate that the flipped classroom
   format can significantly improve the technical communication skills of
   students measured in terms of project report grade and presentation
   grades. It is expected that these results contribute to the construction
   engineering and management pedagogy by increasing the knowledge of
   educators about the effectiveness of flipped classrooms in enhancing the
   students' communication skills.},

Title = {A holistic approach to flipped classroom: A conceptual framework using
   e-platform},
Journal = {INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF ENGINEERING BUSINESS MANAGEMENT},
Year = {2019},
Volume = {11},
Month = {JUN 14},
Abstract = {The extensive adoption of Internet technology led to a second wave of
   change in many different industries: education being one of them. As we
   witnessed the explosion of free online e-learning platforms and videos,
   physical educational institutions also felt the pressure to enhance
   their classroom learning experience in order to stay competitive.
   Coupled with the popularity of mobile devices, physical educational
   institutions could also utilize a combination of technologies to enhance
   teaching and learning, increasing their competitive edge. Flipped
   classroom is the teaching pedagogy which is gaining growing popularity
   among educational institutions. Fundamentally, it is a way of teaching
   such that individual learning could be conducted online outside of
   class, while group interactive learning would be conducted during class
   time. Since this is a relatively new concept using mobile and Internet
   technology, literature is limited and there is yet a systematic approach
   to conduct flipped classroom-related research. Nevertheless, it is
   gaining much attention in the West. However, teaching style in Asia is
   different and its feasibility and performance outcome warrant much of
   our attention. Relatively little research has been conducted on its
   feasibility in Asian culture, acceptance, as well as the relationship
   between the pedagogy and learning outcome. Through building the proposed
   flipped classroom platform in this study, it could facilitate research
   on flipped classroom in different types of knowledge transfer. Thus, its
   feasibility and impact on performance outcome could be thoroughly
   studied across different fields and levels of education in a host of
   countries.},

Abstract = {A peer-coaching approach was adopted in the out-of-class stage of the
   flipped classroom. Out of the classroom, learning tutors help students
   engage in learning and improve performance. Eighty-seven participants
   from two classes were involved in this study. One class of 44 students
   was the experimental group with the peer-coaching approach in a flipped
   classroom, and the other class of 43 students served as the control
   group learning by the conventional video-based flipped classroom mode.
   The experimental results revealed that peer coaching improved student
   engagement and interaction out of class. In the experimental group,
   students interacted not only with tutors and group peers but also with
   students from other groups. The experimental results also show that the
   proposed approach could improve students' learning achievements.},

Abstract = {This paper introduces a multidisciplinary energy management course
   redesigned to include experiential learning philosophy and partially
   flipped classroom concept to improve course delivery effectiveness. The
   course was originally proposed to address the surging demand in the
   local industries that benefit from understanding energy utilization and
   its economics. Instructors previously experienced difficulties in
   engaging students who had neglible energy management backgrounds.
   Therefore, the course materials were updated to include 10 new
   laboratory experiments, a real-world project, and an industry visit. In
   addition, the partially flipped classroom technique was adopted as an
   instructional strategy. Data analyses demonstrated that the employment
   of the two modifications resulted in more satisfied students with higher
   learning outcomes. The paper provides energy management educators a new
   model in course delivery and at the same time endorses experiential
   learning in a partially flipped classroom setting.},

Abstract = {Background: Providing the undergraduate ``Leadership in Nursing{''}
   course using an innovative approach is regarded to be very important in
   terms of enhancing leadership skills. Purpose: The purpose of this study
   was to evaluate the effect of using the ``flipped classroom{''} strategy
   on nursing students' learning achievements and to describe their
   experiences of this technique.
   Method: The course of ``Leadership in Nursing{''} was delivered in
   flipped classroom format for 20 students while another 19 were exposed
   to traditional teaching methods. Therefore, the study was completed with
   39 students. Data was collected using ``Student Introductory Information
   Form{''}, ``Exams (a midterm exam, a final exam and 4 assignments){''},
   ``In-Class Observation Form{''} and ``Student Feedback Form{''}.
   Findings: Students in the flipped classroom group had obtained
   significantly higher scores than the students in the traditional
   teaching group regarding the assignments, the final exam, and overall
   grade. Concerning the flipped classroom, students reported flexibility
   as the most positive aspect and problems related to the system
   infrastructure as the most negative aspect.
   Conclusion: The usage of a flipped classroom for nursing students in the
   leadership course provided valuable results in terms of the students'
   exam scores and achieving course objectives. The flipped classroom
   strategy for the ``Leadership in Nursing{''} course was shown to be
   effective in improving abilities such as distinguishing leadership
   skills, visioning, developing a new perspective, willingness to share
   experiences regarding leadership, also enabling students to work in
   harmony in group activities and to participate in classroom discussions,
   which are all essential elements of leadership.},

Abstract = {The efficacy of the flipped classroom model largely depends on the
   specifications of its design and implementation, and one important
   specification to consider is student agency. With the purpose of
   prescribing the optimal level of student agency for the flipped
   classroom, this study conducted a repeated-measures experimental design
   to compare the effects of three levels of student agency in an
   undergraduate flipped course with 43 students. The empirical results
   revealed that student agency had a significant impact on students'
   academic performance and perceived learning experience. Moreover, a low
   level of student agency appeared to induce superior performance and
   evaluation ratings from the students and counter the influence of
   personality and self-study time. The findings are expected to inform the
   design and implementation of flipped courses and extend our
   understanding of student-centred learning to the context of the flipped
   classroom.},

Abstract = {This study aimed at identifying the differences between a flipped
   classroom and a non-flipped classroom instructional model, based on the
   Self-Determination Theory (SDT). This study employed a mixed-method
   research approach, using post-tests, questionnaires and focus group
   interviews during the data collection process. Sixty-one students were
   the respondents involved in a non-randomised experiment with a control
   group design, while 10 representative students participated in a
   focus-group discussion. The results reported that post-test 1 showed no
   significant difference between the two groups of flipped and non-flipped
   classroom instruction (t = 1.68, p = .474), while post-tests 2 and 3
   were significantly different (t = 5.54, p = .007 < .05) and (t = 10.17,
   p = .001 < .05). This finding shows that students in the flipped
   learning environment were more competent handling online tasks and
   activities, and were able to control their learning outcomes.The survey
   results showed that the flip-class setting fostered better peer
   interaction and autonomous learning skills among the students.The
   flip-class environment had also a positive influence on
   students'intrinsic motivation. The qualitative findings from the
   students'interviews revealed that students were motivated by the
   video-recorded lectures, self-regulated learning environments,
   engagement in class activities and peer interaction. Conclusions from
   this study showed that the flip-class setting had successfully
   established the basic psychological needs of SDT, namely: competency,
   autonomy and relatedness in a flipped classroom model.},

Title = {IMPACT OF THE FLIPPED CLASSROOM ON LEARNER ACHIEVEMENT AND SATISFACTION

Abstract = {Aim/Purpose The purpose of this study was to examine the impact of the
   flipped classroom model on learner achievement and satisfaction for
   undergraduate learners
   Background The context for this research on the flipped classroom was an
   introductory technology literacy course at a public, research
   university.
   Methodology This study employed a quasi-experimental pre-test/post-test
   design consisting of two groups: the treatment condition (sections in
   which instructors implemented the flipped classroom model for the module
   that was the focus of the study) and control condition (sections in
   which instructors lectured in the faceto- face meeting, then learners
   completed the practice online as homework). Learners in each group
   received their form of instruction and completed the same instructional
   activities, tests, and surveys. These data were analyzed using
   descriptive statistics, Analysis of Variance (ANOVA), and Analysis of
   Covariance (ANACOVA) models.
   Contribution This research adds to a growing base of literature on the
   flipped classroom, a special instantiation of blended learning.
   Findings Results indicated that there was no significant difference
   between the two groups in terms of learner achievement. In terms of
   learner satisfaction, however, there was a significant difference in
   which participants favored the control condition.
   Recommendations for Practitioners Practitioners should select situations
   that are appropriate for the flipped classroom context. This should be
   reflected in the implementation of curriculum that would benefit from
   the affordances of this approach.
   Recommendation for Researchers Researchers should seek to replicate this
   study in longer durations and using rigorously developed and validated
   measures.
   Impact on Society This study suggests the flipped classroom may not be
   perceived by learners in an introductory technology literacy course as
   beneficial to their satisfaction.
   Future Research Future research should seek to replicate studies in
   technology literacy courses to identify the optimal learning situations
   for the blended learning environment.},

Abstract = {Flipped classroom is a new blended type of pedagogy. This study attempts
   to examine whether flipped classroom, with reference to self-regulation
   principles, is a good pedagogy for enhancing formative learning outcomes
   for first year university students. A total of 73 students, enrolled on
   a teacher education program, participated in this study. Data were
   collected from different sources in three phases. In the first phase,
   data were collected from pre- and post-tests, and the number of viewings
   of the assigned online videos were logged. Techniques in editing images
   applied by the group and the individual were examined in the second
   phase. Finally, opinions related to flipped classroom were collected
   from focus group interviews in the third phase. The results suggest that
   students are able to apply their self-learned knowledge to editing
   images both together and individually. They were very positive about
   flipped classroom activities and all 7 self-regulated (SR) learning
   principles were achieved. While students embraced the flexibility of
   learning online, they missed the face-to-face interaction with the
   teacher and their learning peers. This was especially the case when they
   did not understand the content of the online videos. This study provides
   an additional lens of SR principles.},

   Education students' perceptions of their learning and motivation during
   the current pandemic. The sample consisted of 179 student teachers from
   the Faculty of Education of the University of Murcia in the academic
   year 2020-2021, in which the flipped classroom model was implemented.
   Identical surveys were administered and examined through both
   descriptive statistics and non-parametric tests. Statistically
   significant differences were found between pre-tests and post-tests with
   experienced students scoring higher on average in the latter. Most
   students had a positive perception about the flipped classroom, noting
   the advantage of practical in-class activities, as well as increased

Abstract = {The Flipped Classroom teaching method is presented as an active method
   in which the normal procedure is inverted. The students watch video
   sessions or polyformats in line with the concepts taught in the normal
   class. This inverted approach with respect to the traditional class was
   applied to lab practice sessions in the subject of Graphic Expression as
   part of the Industrial Technologies Engineering Degree course at the
   Universitat Politecnica de Valencia in the year 2018-19. The flipped
   classroom took place in weekly sessions with video sessions before and
   after, while problems were set to be solved during and after the class.
   The procedure was followed up later in in-class sessions. Everything was
   controlled by the Lessons app.
   This method was seen to increase students' motivation and clarify their
   perceptions to a greater degree than the traditional teaching method,
   while encouraging self-learning and collaborative learning among the
   class members and improving student-lecturer communications. Evaluation
   grades were found to increase, and the Flipped Classroom technique was
   given the general approval of both students and lecturers.},

Abstract = {The flipped classroom is an alternative approach to the conventional
   lecture by introducing collaborative tasks in the class to promote
   active learning. The theoretical lecture was delivered to the students
   through videos, which they watch at home before the class. The
   implementation of this method at the undergraduate level especially in
   engineering courses was reported to be lacking. This study presents a
   five-semester observation in the Rigid Body Dynamics course, during
   which the first two semesters were conducted using the conventional
   approach, and the following three semesters were flipped. Three
   indicators were measured to evaluate the effectiveness of the method:
   the percentage of failures, the number of student enrolments, and the
   lecturer evaluation score. There is strong evidence showing that flipped
   classroom has increased the student's performance. Also, it was found
   that the students prefer this method compared to the conventional
   approach. This study demonstrates that the flipped classroom approach
   can be implemented in engineering courses with a good chance of success.},

Year = {2019},
Volume = {11},
Number = {17},
Month = {SEP 1},
Abstract = {Goal 4 of the Agenda 2030 sustainable development goals (SDGs) is aimed
   at working towards quality in education. Universities have an important
   role in teaching sustainability principles. Yet, which methods are
   effective for engaging students in understanding the importance of
   sustainable development and introducing them to new perspectives to make
   changes? The methodology of the flipped classroom is a possible
   alternative for the pedagogic renovation. This is known as an
   information-based environment in which teachers provide a variety of
   learning resources so that students can complete the knowledge transfer
   process before the class. Once inside classroom, teachers and students
   can complete the internalization of knowledge by answering questions,
   and through collaborative consultations and interactive exchanges, among
   others. A survey of 154 students taught by flipped classroom methodology
   was conducted in order to analyze whether this helps with learning about
   sustainable development. The results show the active and reflexive
   learning from flipped classroom methodology makes students more
   committed to sustainable development. This research would be useful to
   anyone interested in applying the flip the class teaching methodology as
   an integrated form of thinking and training in the curriculum of
   sustainable development for higher education students.},

Abstract = {Implementation of the flipped classroom approach into STEM courses has
   been popularized in the last decade and has generally been reported to
   improve student performance outcomes. In a flipped classroom setting,
   students typically first encounter course content in the online format
   and subsequently engage in some form of active learning during the
   in-person class meetings. Although the flipped classroom approach can
   promote increased student engagement and provide an opportunity to apply
   content encountered in the classroom, this structure does not generally
   give students opportunities for discrete concept development prior to
   the application phase of learning. In an effort to build concept
   development activities into a flipped classroom structure, five learning
   cycle activities were implemented in a large enrollment first-term
   general chemistry course that has previously implemented the flipped
   classroom design. Four of these learning cycle activities incorporated
   PhET simulations as part of the exploration phase of learning, and all
   five activities were facilitated during the in-person class meetings to
   initiate the learning cycle. The activities were designed to help
   students explore models and engage in concept development. The
   application phase of the learning cycle was facilitated by flipped
   classroom modules or in-person classroom activities that included
   whole-class questioning coupled with collaborative think-pair-share
   discussion. Performance gains in conceptual understanding were evaluated
   by employing a one-group, pre-post-post research design. Non-parametric
   Friedman's tests indicate a significant main effect across time for each
   concept development activity, and post hoc Wilcoxon signed rank tests
   indicate the post-test and final exam scores are significantly higher
   than the pre-test scores for each activity (p < 0.001 for each pre-post
   and pre-final pairwise comparison). The findings reported herein
   demonstrate that concept development activities can be successfully
   integrated with flipped classroom modules and the combination of the
   introductory learning cycle activities and flipped classroom application
   activities led to knowledge gains that persisted through the end of the
   course. In total, creating this type of blended learning environment
   appears to help students achieve understanding of core general chemistry
   concepts.},

Abstract = {The authors of this article estimate the learning effects of the flipped
   classroom format using data from 16 sections of principles of
   microeconomics over a 4-year period. The experimental design is unique
   in that two treatment and two control sections were taught during the
   fall semester in four consecutive years. Further, the instructor
   switched the time of day when the treatment and control sections were
   taught each year. Controlling for gender, ACT score, a normed high
   school GPA, Pell Grant award, time of day, and initial knowledge of
   economics, the authors find no evidence of increased learning using
   end-of-semester measures for students in the flipped classroom in
   comparison to sections with a moderate amount of active learning.},

Abstract = {This research analyzed Physical Education students' degree of academic
   performance with the incorporation of active methodologies, specifically
   flipped classroom mixed learning, restricted to evaluation periods in
   the months of June and September. The study focused on whether there are
   significant differences in this variable through the scores obtained.
   Through a simple random sampling, 131 students participated in this
   empiric-analytic research, using an ex-post-facto study with a
   retrospective design with quasi-control group. A robust test of averages
   comparison, multiple linear regressions and an evaluation of the
   relative importance of predictors was conducted. The results show how
   flipped classroom methodology linearly and positively influences
   academic performance and correlational motivation and support. As main
   conclusion, in a hybrid and digitalized learning context, the value of
   the consideration of active methodologies (flipped classroom) based on
   emerging pedagogies, allows improving students' achievement and
   competence development, providing critical, significant, ubiquitous,
   transformational and especially motivating experiences.},

Abstract = {Many educators utilize simulations to create active learning
   environments suitable for learning outcome achievement and soft skill
   development, which are critical for student success in the workforce.
   However, many educators focus primarily on affective benefits of
   simulations, such as engagement and motivation, rather than cognitive
   impacts, such as business knowledge attainment. The authors share
   favorable results of a quasi-experimental study with large sample
   (n=206) that measured cognitive gains through pretest and posttest
   assessments of simulation game learners in a business finance, flipped
   classroom, course. Additionally, the authors discuss valuable contextual
   factors surrounding their study, including the curriculum, course, and
   flipped classroom approach.},

Title = {Flipped classroom improves results in pathophysiology learning: results

Volume = {44},

Abstract = {The flipped classroom has become increasingly popular in health
   professions education. The aim of this study was to analyze its effect
   on learning in a pathophysiology course. Flipped classroom was
   introduced to teach respiratory pathophysiology in 2018. We compared the
   exam results in respiratory pathophysiology in 2017 and 2018 and the
   exam results in blood pathophysiology from both years (taught by the
   same teacher, in a traditional way). Groups were compared with Student's
   t test. Students answered a survey after finishing the term. Two hundred
   and one students were examined in 2018 (and 229 in 2017). Gender
   distribution and the qualifications obtained in general pathology (in
   the previous year) were comparable in both years. Results in respiratory
   pathophysiology were significantly better in 2018 than in 2017 (mean: 48
   vs. 42 out of 100; P = 0.004), but the results in blood pathophysiology
   remained similar. The improvement was significant only in students who
   scored below the median (mean: 40 vs. 33; P = 0.009) and was more
   evident in male than in female students (mean: 52 vs. 44; P = 0.01) and
   in those who did not have an academic delay (mean 51 vs. 44; P = 0.002).
   Most students considered that flipped classroom was more attractive and
   helped them to learn more and with less effort. Flipped classroom
   increased medical students' knowledge acquisitions in pathophysiology.
   It was more beneficial to male students and those with lower
   qualifications with no academic delay.},

Title = {A gross anatomy flipped classroom effects performance, retention, and

Abstract = {A flipped classroom is a growing pedagogy in higher education. Many
   research studies on the flipped classroom have focused on student
   outcomes, with the results being positive or inconclusive. A few studies
   have analyzed confounding variables, such as student's previous
   achievement, or the impact of a flipped classroom on long-term retention
   and knowledge transfer. In the present study, students in a Doctor of
   Physical Therapy program in a traditional style lecture of gross anatomy
   (n = 105) were compared to similar students in a flipped classroom (n =
   112). Overall, students in the flipped anatomy classroom had an increase
   in semester average grades (P = 0.01) and performance on higher-level
   analytical questions (P < 0.001). Long-term retention and knowledge
   transfer was analyzed in a subsequent semester's sequenced kinesiology
   course, with students from the flipped anatomy classroom performing at a
   higher level in kinesiology (P < 0.05). Student's pre-matriculation
   grade point average was also considered. Previously lower performing
   students, when in a flipped anatomy class, outperformed their
   traditional anatomy class counterparts in anatomy semester grades (P <
   0.05), accuracy on higher-level analytical anatomy multiple-choice
   questions (P < 0.05) and performance in subsequent course of kinesiology
   (P < 0.05). This study suggests that the flipped classroom may benefit
   lower performing student's knowledge acquisition and transfer to a
   greater degree than higher performing students. Future studies should
   explore the underlying reasons for improvement in lower performing
   students.},

Abstract = {Background: With the convert of educational concept, flipped classroom
   has been adopted gradually in radiology courses as a new teaching mode.
   Considering no evidence has been concluded to illustrate the
   effectiveness of of flipped classroom over traditional
   instructor-centered lectures in radiology education, this meta-analysis
   was conducted to provide empirical evidence for the reform of
   pedagogical. Methods: Studies were retrieved from six databases,
   including Pubmed, Embase, Web of Science, Wanfang Data, CNKI, and VIP,
   from their inception to 16 February 2020. Literature selection and data
   extraction were completed by two reviewers independently. The effect
   size of each index was expressed as the odds ratio (OR) for a
   categorical variable and standard mean difference (SMD) for a continuous
   variable, each with corresponding 95\% confidence interval (95\% CI).
   Results: A total of 19 studies with 2114 participants were deemed to be
   eligible for inclusion. The results of this meta-analysis indicated
   that: the newly emerged flipped classroom represented significant
   advantage versus traditional lecture in improving theoretical
   performance (SMD 1.12, 95\% CI 0.61-1.63,P < .001), as well as in
   cultivating students' practical skills (SMD 2.59, 95\% CI 1.69-3.59,P <
   .001). In the subjective findings of investigation, more positive
   responses were attained in students who took radiology subjects in
   flipped classroom, covering course satisfaction (OR 1.70, 95\% CI
   1.35-2.14,P < .001), improvement of teamwork ability (OR 1.80, 95\% CI
   1.21-2.67,P = .004), self-directed learning and reflection (OR 1.98,
   95\% CI 1.31-2.97,P = .001), and subjective cognition on consolidation
   of knowledge mastery (OR 1.38, 95\% CI 1.19-1.60,P < .001). Conclusion:
   Flipped classroom displays multiple advantages versus traditional
   lecture-based teaching mode, which is well worth further promoting and
   applying in the process of radiology education.},

Abstract = {For this study the authors explored the use of pre-recorded lecture
   videos by students in a large introductory management course using a
   flipped classroom design to determine patterns of video use and to
   explore the potential relationship between student use of videos (video
   viewing) and student learning measured by grades and student
   satisfaction as measured by an end-of-course survey. A quantitative
   study approach was used, using frequency counts of student video use,
   student grades on three exams, and student responses to a 20-question
   survey. Correlation analysis results indicate that student use of videos
   varied significantly along several aspects - across the multiple video
   segments addressing a course topic, by time of day and day of week, and
   during the full course term. Implications for effective use of
   pre-recorded videos when implementing the flipped classroom model are
   discussed along with directions for much-needed future research.},

Abstract = {With the deepening of the research on flipped classroom teaching theory,
   the flipped classroom teaching model has gradually been applied to
   classroom teaching at all levels and types of schools, and some
   beneficial results and experiences have been obtained. Due to the
   relatively low self-learning ability and motivation level of students,
   in the implementation of flipped classrooms, the quality of preclass
   self-study links is difficult to guarantee, resulting in unsatisfactory
   results of flipped classroom teaching in secondary vocational schools.
   This article aims to solve the current dilemma faced by the optimization
   of the flipped classroom teaching mode of programming courses by
   studying the course platform based on the flipped classroom teaching
   model. The source-destination node distribution is constructed with a
   model based on node affinity to restore the actual network node
   distribution architecture. The change in the distribution of
   source-destination nodes has led to different degrees of aggregation in
   the overall data flow of the network. After that, the capacity and delay
   performance of the primary network and the secondary network will change
   as the degree of data flow aggregation changes. By laying base stations
   in the main network, we reanalyzed the network. Through the
   comprehensive analysis of students' learning status through the scores
   of students in class and the test situation after class, we modify the
   specific teaching plan of flipped classroom. Experiments have proved
   that the in-class flipping model we proposed effectively avoids the
   inherent shortcomings of students who are not strong in autonomous
   learning before class, solves the problem that secondary vocational
   students cannot do well in autonomous learning before class, and
   improves students to a certain extent. The results show that the flipped
   classroom teaching model in class can provide more powerful value for
   vocational teaching to achieve this goal.},

Abstract = {Flipped classroom is a strategy that began to be used at the higher
   education as a measure to improve the performance and motivation of
   students. As one of the first activities of the research project in
   which this article is framed, a search was made of the state of the art
   of the flipped classroom in higher education. For this, a systematic
   review of the scientific literature was carried out, with the aim of
   knowing if the flipped classroom methodology is applied in higher
   education, what tools are used and if they correspond to Web 3.0. On the
   other side, it was analyzed whether the application of this methodology
   generates competencies, such as: learning continuously and autonomously;
   perform effectively in work teams; solve engineering problems and
   effectively use application techniques and tools in engineering; which
   correspond to the competencies sought in the project under analysis. The
   article presents the results of the systematic review, which shows that
   the flipped classroom is applied in engineering education, that
   different tools are used but that this implementation must have certain
   considerations to be applied successfully, such as: the correct planning
   of the activities to be carried out by both the students and the
   teachers, the knowledge of both actors about the methodology to be used,
   among others.},

Title = {Comparison of Mini-Game-Based Flipped Classroom and Video-Based Flipped
   Classroom: An Analysis of Learning Performance, Flow and Concentration
   on Discussion},
Journal = {ASIA-PACIFIC EDUCATION RESEARCHER},
Abstract = {The flipped classroom has been widely discussed in recent years, but
   some important issues still need in-depth exploration, including how to
   increase learners' autonomous learning motivation before the class, how
   to work with in-class discussion activities, and how to improve
   learner's concentration on discussions and lower their learning
   anxieties for high-level cognitive thinking. This study integrated
   theories of digital game-based learning (DGBL) and flipped classrooms,
   proposing the mini-game-based flipped classroom (MGFC) teaching model.
   In this teaching model, learners used a mini-educational game developed
   based on cognitive theories for DGBL autonomous learning in class, and
   then worked with collaborative problem solving (CPS) activities to
   improve learning and discussions. The study involved a quasi-experiment
   to evaluate this teaching model. The experimental group used MGFC, while
   the control group used the traditional flipped classroom teaching method
   by watching the video first and then having group discussions. The study
   analyzed the differences in the learning performance and acceptance of
   the two groups, and analyzed gender differences. Moreover, this study
   used quantitative content analysis (QCA) to explore learner's
   concentration on their discussion content. The results showed that the
   MGFC group had significantly higher scores than the control group in
   their learning performance and acceptance. The MGFC group also showed a
   high level of flow. The QCA results showed that MGFC enhanced the
   frequency of learner's learning discussions and their concentration in
   the learning process.},

Abstract = {Dialogical learning and teamwork have become the principles demanded by
   the knowledge society, given that we are currently living in a
   completely globalised world that requires skilled citizens to
   collaborate on a social, professional and academic level. Likewise,
   creativity is another key element requested by organisations to solve
   problems. Against this background, some student-centred teaching methods
   like flipped classrooms are appearing. Therefore, this paper aimed to
   analyse the implementation of the flipped classroom method as a factor
   to develop dialogical learning and creativity. To this regard, a
   quantitative method was used, applying a survey prepared ad hoc to a
   sample of 308 students from Spain and Colombia, in order to know whether
   implementing the flipped classroom truly enhances the development of
   such skills. According to the results obtained, it is stated that
   developing the flipped classroom method promotes a team-based work
   dynamic, which generates dialogical learning among students. It also
   enhances creativity, since it provides students with autonomy to carry
   out their tasks. Finally, the flipped classroom pedagogical approach is
   a teaching method with numerous advantages and benefits for students to
   adapt to the competencies required by the knowledge society.},

Abstract = {Background: Second-year MBBS students need to be trained in applying
   theoretical knowledge into practice so that they can give appropriate
   advice during family visits in the community. For this, it is necessary
   to utilize the classroom timing for discussion and facilitation. In
   ``flipped classrooms,{''} what is normally done in class and what is
   normally done as homework is switched or flipped. Thus, a study was
   planned to train the students to apply theory into practice by using
   flipped classroom methodology. Methods: After ethical committee approval
   and informed consent, 48 second year MBBS students were enrolled in the
   study. Selected topics (i.e., ``nutrition in under-five children{''})
   was taught through the ``flipped classroom{''}model after a pretest
   assessment. Students were allotted a family case in the urban slums
   having at least one under-five child so that they can apply theory into
   practice. The formal assessment was done through structured case viva
   and spot examination. After 3 months, a posttest was conducted in the
   classroom to assess retention in knowledge. Feedback of the students was
   taken on the flipped classroom model. Results: The average marks scored
   in structured case viva with spot examination was 8.28 +/- 2.4 marks.
   There was a statistically significant association of scores in the
   structured case viva with spot examination with participation in all
   pre- and in-class activities (P < 0.05). There was a statistically
   significant difference in pre- and posttest marks (10.03 +/- 2.17 vs.
   18.84 +/- 3.8). The class average normalized gain was 44\%. Overall,
   there was positive feedback for ``flipped classroom teaching.{''} Most
   of the students felt that this was a practical approach to the topic.
   Discussion: Students can apply theory into practice and knowledge gained
   is also retained through the use of the flipped classroom teaching
   method.},

Abstract = {Background: Modern innovative education approaches are crucial to be
   incorporated into nursing education that leads to improving
   evidence-based teaching strategies, and closes the gap between theory
   and practice, as well as to prepare the nursing students to their future
   workplaces. Aim: Aim of the study was evaluation the effectiveness of
   the flipped classroom method among nursing students regarding VTE basic
   knowledge, risk factors, and prophylaxis. Subjects and Methods: This
   study was implemented in a Faculty of Nursing in Northern Cyprus at
   Nicosia, and used pre-test and post-test, and interventional design. A
   total of 100 bachelor-degree nursing students were composed the sample
   of the study. The Implementation of the study was conducted in three
   phases including pre-test, educational intervention, and post-test. Data
   were evaluated using the independent-sample t test. Results: The
   findings of the study showed statistically significant improvement in
   the overall mean scores of all VTE after the educational intervention
   through flipped classroom. Students classified the strength points with
   four themes; deep motive learning, technology support, team-based
   learning, and satisfaction. Conclusions: Our results support the
   effectiveness of the flipped classroom method in nursing education; the
   method may be useful for developing of educational strategies in
   nursing.},

Abstract = {The flipped classroom as an educational model is perfectly aligned with
   the current demands of higher education. Therefore, the objectives of
   this article were to carry out a bibliometric analysis of the scientific
   production of the flipped classroom in higher education (2012-2020) and
   to propose a framework for its implementation in face-to-face, blended
   or online learning modalities. The records were recovered from the Web
   of Science Core Collection and Scopus, from which, after a five-phase
   methodological process, a consolidated dataset of 782 documents was
   obtained. The results showed the importance of the subject matter as
   scientific production reflected a continuous growth during the period of
   study. For their part, the most productive authors come from various
   institutions worldwide with an H index of over 50. The collaboration
   indicators show the growth trend of these indexes over the years, which
   reflects the capacity to generate national and international impact in
   the documents published in collaboration. The keywords co-occurrence
   analysis showed that the flipped classroom as a technological and
   innovative approach is complemented by active learning, blended
   learning, e-learning, ICT, teaching method, among others. Finally, a
   framework with five components was proposed as a basic guide for the
   implementation of the flipped classroom in higher education.},

Abstract = {The flipped classroom method, which could be considered as one of the
   crucial new generation teaching approaches, is a permutation of the
   educational activities that are carried out inside and outside of the
   classroom environment. The main purpose of the present study is to
   determine the impact of the flipped classroom approach on students'
   academic achievement and their attitudes toward programming and
   methodology at the higher education level. The current study employed a
   mixed research method as findings were transcribed on the basis of
   quantitative and qualitative data sets. Academic achievement tests and
   attitudes toward programming scales were used to collect quantitative
   data, whereas a semistructured focus group interview was used to collect
   the qualitative data set. The findings demonstrated that a statistically
   significant difference existed among the students in the experimental
   group and students within the control group regarding their attitudes
   toward programming and academic achievement. The results of the study
   reported that the experimental group had more positive attitudes and
   higher levels of academic achievement when compared with the control
   group. The advantages of the flipped classroom model include the
   elevated teacher-student interaction, raised independence in terms of
   accessing courses regardless of time and place, the opportunity to save
   time particularly during practicing, student-centered structure and
   increased motivation. This method also has many disadvantages. These
   include the need for technological requirements, students not watching
   videos, poor attendance to the course, and the lowered student-teacher
   interaction, especially outside the classroom.},

Abstract = {Flipped classroom refers to an instructional approach in which students
   study educational videos at home and do homework assignments in class.
   The present study aims to compare flipped classroom with other forms of
   video-based instruction and determine which types of students benefit
   most from video-based instruction. Thirty-eight EFL school classes with
   848 ninth-grade students took part in a quasi-experimental pre-post-test
   intervention study over four weeks. Two independent variables were
   completely crossed resulting in four experimental conditions: video (at
   home vs. in class) and instructional method (student-centred vs. teacher
   centred). Multilevel analysis reveals that all four experimental
   conditions were equally effective in promoting students' learning gains.
   At-risk, average and excellent students profited least from the learning
   conditions. The study constitutes a first step towards a comprehensive
   evaluation of flipped classroom by using a better-controlled research
   design and may contribute to a more objective discussion about the
   positive effects of flipped classroom.},

Title = {Pharmacy students' perception of learning and engagement in a
   flipped-classroom of a physiology course},
Journal = {INNOVATIONS IN EDUCATION AND TEACHING INTERNATIONAL},
Abstract = {This interventional study implemented flipped classroom pedagogy to
   enhance pharmacy students' academic performance in a physiology course.
   Ninety-six Pharm. D students enrolled at a private-sector University of
   Islamabad, Pakistan were provided with video lectures and reading
   material for pre-sessional learning followed by a faculty-led
   face-to-face session for case-studies, class discussions and post-class
   quiz. Students' feedback was recorded through Likert-scale survey and
   comments on method employed. Up to 90\% of students completed the
   pre-session preparation. Around 90\% of students gave positive responses
   towards flipped classroom. Students reported that they developed a
   better understanding of the concepts (1.5 +/- 0.65), their class
   participation was improved (1.45 +/- 0.56) and they could pay close
   attention in the class (1.41 +/- 0.62), compared to the regular
   lectures. It is concluded that flipped classroom is an effective way of
   enhancing students' engagement and active learning and can be used as a
   tool in Pharmacy education.},

Abstract = {This study aims to identify students' learning styles of using mobile
   flipped classroom approach. The theoretical foundation for this study is
   based on Grasha-Reichmann learning styles and the flipped design of this
   study is based on Halili flipped learning 4.0 framework. 52 respondents
   answered the questionnaire distributed to them. The SPSS software
   version 20 was utilised to analyse the data and collected data were
   analyzed using descriptive statistics (means, standard deviations). This
   study showed that collaborative learning style recorder higher mean
   value as compared to others learning styles such as independent,
   dependent, competitive, avoidant and participative. It was found that
   the mobile flipped classroom approach in this research is capable of
   promoting collaborative learning in teaching and learning process.
   Researchers suggest that further studies should explore other learning
   style theories, use varieties of technological tools as well as include
   a larger sample from different institutions.},

Abstract = {Research has shown that the potential benefits of a flipped classroom
   could be diminished by the way students perceive and prepare information
   prior to class. This study aims to explore individual characteristics,
   such as learner motivation, self-efficacy and epistemology beliefs, that
   might have an impact on learning outcomes in a flipped classroom. Data
   were collected using four instruments during a 7-week flipped classroom
   conducted from mid-September 2014 to mid-November 2014 with a total
   enrolment of 85 students (10 females and 75 males) in the required
   course, Applied English for Vocational Education. After controlling for
   pre-test and other covariates (eg, gender, grade and experience), an
   analysis based on structural equation modeling showed a positive and
   significant (=0.12, p<0.05) indirect effect of instrumentality
   (promotion) on the change in test scores through averaged quiz scores.
   Beliefs had a significant positive effect on change in scores between
   pre- and post-tests (=0.20, p<0.05). Findings revealed that language
   learners with a high level of motivation in instrumentality (promotion)
   followed quiz mechanisms closely and thus benefited most from the
   flipped classroom. Learners with high beliefs exhibited improvement in
   the post-tests without doing well in quizzes. The implications for a
   flipped language learning classroom are discussed, including multiple
   strategies for regulating learners of different personal traits to
   preview the online course content before class.},

Abstract = {Although there are some studies revealing the effectiveness of the
   implementation of flipped classroom, but a study investigating the
   feasibility and effectiveness of weblog integration during the
   implementation of flipped classroom for teaching civics is still scarce.
   This study aimed at investigating the feasibility and the effectiveness
   of the implementation of weblog-based flipped classroom model. This
   study used the combined approach (Creswell, 2012) of qualitative and
   quantitative. The qualitative approach was in the form of a case study
   design. Meanwhile, the quantitative approach was in the form of
   experimental with pre-and-post test design. The participants of this
   study were 42 students of Social Class of Islamic Senior High School.
   The data were gathered through semi-structured interview, questionnaire,
   and test, i.e. pre-and-post test. The qualitative data were analyzed
   descriptively; and the quantitative data were analyzed by using paired
   sample t-test formula. The results revealed that the implementation of
   weblog-based flipped classroom is feasible and applicable. Furthermore,
   it has been statistically proven that it is effective to teach civics
   indicated by the raise of students' achievement in civics. This study
   implies that innovation of technology-based learning has great influence
   in students' achievement and this should be taken into account by the
   related parties.},

Title = {``A Little Flip Goes a Long Way{''}-The Impact of a Flipped Classroom
   Design on Student Performance and Engagement in a First-Year
   Undergraduate Economics Classroom},
Journal = {EDUCATION SCIENCES},

Abstract = {The flipped classroom is gaining prominence as an active learning
   pedagogy to engage a new generation of students. However, all courses do
   not lend themselves to a fully flipped design and instructors are often
   reluctant to flip lectures due to the additional time and effort
   involved, especially so in case of technical subjects such as economics.
   This study experiments with a flipped classroom design in a first-year
   undergraduate economics course. The research was motivated by the fact
   that many undergraduate economics students do not engage with
   traditional lectures. They fail to acquire critical thinking, data
   handling and reasoning skills, which are thought to be at the core of
   the economics curriculum. In this flipped classroom format, traditional
   lectures were substituted with micro-lectures and the remaining class
   time was devoted to active learning pedagogies including quizzes, group
   work and student presentations. The full lectures were panopto recorded
   and put up on the e-learning site, Blackboard. In order to evaluate the
   effectiveness of the flipped classroom format, I compared the final exam
   scores of students in the flipped classroom with those in the control
   group, which followed a traditional lecture-based approach. The key
   results from the analysis revealed that students in the flipped
   classroom performed better in the final exams vis-a-vis students in the
   traditional classroom format. Furthermore, students in the flipped
   classroom format were 1.61 times less likely to fail in the module as
   compared to students in a traditional classroom format. This format also
   resulted in better student engagement, more flexibility and enhanced
   student-tutor interactions within the classroom.},

Abstract = {The study explored English as a Foreign Language (EFL) low proficiency
   students' reflections and experience of learning in a structured flipped
   writing program, in a foreign university branch campus in Malaysia. It
   investigated the areas in which students showed improvement after
   flipped classroom learning. Qualitative data collected from
   semi-structured interviews of a sample of 18 students revealed that most
   students had positive experiences of the use of flipped classroom,
   reporting that they had greater time preparation before class; increased
   practice, engagement, interaction, motivation and immediate feedback
   during class, and a higher level of self-efficacy after class. Some
   shortcomings of this approach included the feeling of boredom and that
   it was time-consuming.},

   Systematic Review and Meta-Analysis},
Journal = {AERA OPEN},
Year = {2019},
Volume = {5},
Number = {3},
Month = {JUL},
Abstract = {We searched and meta-analyzed studies comparing flipped classroom
   teaching with traditional, lecture-based teaching to evaluate the
   evidence for the flipped classroom's influence on continuous-learning
   measures, pass/fail rates, and student evaluations of teaching. Eight
   electronic reference databases were searched to retrieve relevant
   studies. Our results indicate a small effect in favor of the flipped
   classroom on learning (Hedges' g = 0.35, 95\% confidence interval {[}CI]
   {[}0.31, 0.40], k = 272). However, analyses restricted to studies with
   sufficient power resulted in an estimate of 0.24 (95\% CI {[}0.18,
   0.31], k = 90). Effects on pass rates (odds ratio = 1.55, 95\% CI
   {[}1.34, 1.78], k = 45) and student satisfaction (Hedges' g = 0.16, 95\%
   CI {[}0.06, 0.26], k = 69) were small and also likely influenced by
   publication bias. There is some support for the notion that the positive
   impact on learning may increase slightly if testing student preparation
   is part of the implementation.},

Abstract = {The flipped classroom model has gained prominence as advances in
   technology afford increasing opportunities for ubiquitous access to a
   variety of online resources. Despite the benefit of the flipped
   classroom model, flipped classrooms are not equally advantageous to all
   students due to its self-regulated nature. To address the issues in
   flipped learning, we explored principles for supporting self-regulated
   learning in flipped learning by synthesizing suggestions provided in
   previous research. We also conducted an empirical study to validate the
   identified principles by implementing a self-regulated learning support
   that combined a learner dashboard with a reflection interface in a real
   flipped classroom setting. While the dashboard interface utilized
   students' learning traces to support students' self-monitoring and
   evaluation, the reflection interface facilitated their follow-up
   reflection, which contributed to the cyclical process of self-regulated
   learning. The results indicated that the experimental group that used
   the support for self-regulated learning exhibited higher levels of
   self-regulated learning skills, behavioral engagement in pre-class
   sessions, cognitive engagement in in-class sessions, emotional
   engagement in both pre- and in-class session, learning performance than
   the control group. Implications for future research and directions for
   design and implementation of self-regulated learning supports are
   described.},

Abstract = {The peculiarity of the flipped classroom method lies in the change of
   learning roles, where the teacher acquires a secondary role as a guide
   and the student a primary role as an active agent. The trend of
   implementation in the stage of higher education is increasing and it is
   increasingly common to hear teaching experiences that revolve around its
   application in the classroom. Therefore, this paper aims to assess the
   effect of the flipped classroom methodology on the academic performance
   of university students from the studies indexed in the wos and Scopus
   databases. A methodology of meta-analysis studies has been followed,
   with the purpose of measuring the size of the global and particular
   effect of the researchers and empirically verifying the gain in favour
   of the experimental or control group. The results show that the
   difference between groups is statistically significant and most of the
   studies confirm the increase in academic performance in the experimental
   group. However, there is evidence of a possible bias in the articles
   published in favour of the flipped classroom method. Finally, the
   flipped classroom method is raised as a teaching methodology that can
   improve academic results and make it easier for students to
   self-regulate their learning.},

Abstract = {In recent years, teachers have seen how the difficulty of achieving
   effective communication into the classroom to get an efficient
   teaching-learning process has increased considerably. Current students,
   especially in Primary Education, have acquired skills in new technology
   in an unconscious way, which let them have access to any kind of
   information in a few minutes. Current methodologies should be developed
   more so that that pupils can acquire a more significant learning. The
   Flipped Classroom methodology is one of them, which combines the use of
   ICTs with the use of videos to transmit the contents.},

Title = {Cognitive regulations in ICT-supported flipped classroom interactions:
   An activity theory perspective},
Journal = {BRITISH JOURNAL OF EDUCATIONAL TECHNOLOGY},
Year = {2020},
Volume = {51},
Number = {1},
Pages = {103-130},
Month = {JAN},
Abstract = {In recent years, most studies on flipped classrooms or flipped learning
   have focused on learners' motivation, academic achievement and teachers'
   and students' perceptions of the flipped classroom. Little research has
   involved interactions in the flipped classroom. This study aims to show
   that in-class collaborative learning in the flipped classroom can not
   only be conceived as a collective activity consisting of discrete
   actions, but also as a systematic activity. From the
   activity-theoretical perspective, contradictions were found between
   components of an activity such as subject, tools, rules, community,
   division of labor, object and outcome. This study conducted a
   pre-experiment, selecting one lesson of the seventh-grade Information
   Technology Course as the learning content, conducted in a flipped
   classroom. Three triads with different compositions were specifically
   observed by recording their interactions. More second-level
   contradictions existed between subject and tools, and division of labor
   within the low-level triad than within the other two triads, and more
   first-level contradictions also occurred within the low-level triad than
   within the other two triads. Most second-level contradictions within the
   high-level triad were resolved by self-regulation of cognition. Instead,
   most second-level contradictions within the mixed-level triad were
   overcome by co-regulation or shared regulation of cognition. This study
   sheds light on how to effectively design and implement flipped learning,
   and provides a new approach for analyzing interactions in the classroom.},

Abstract = {Objective: To determine the effectiveness of teaching through flipped
   classroom model on learning and acceptability of undergraduate medical
   students in their radiology clerkship.
   Study Design: Quasi-experimental design.
   Place and Duration of Study: Radiology Department, The Aga Khan
   University Hospital, Karachi, from July to September 2018.
   Methodology: Two groups (A and B) of third year medical students during
   their two weeks radiology clerkship were included. The topic of ``chest
   X-ray{''} interpretation was presented in the flip classroom format to
   group B, while for the group A the same topic of chest X-ray was taught
   by traditional didactic lecture. The scores of the end of clerkship test
   of both groups were analysed using independent sample t-test. At the end
   of the clerkship, the students in group B completed the survey to share
   their experience and perception of flipped classroom model.
   Results: A total of 40 third-year students participated in the study, 20
   in each group. The mean test scores in the end of rotation test of group
   A was 7.3 and of group B was 7.2. No significant difference in the
   post-test scores was observed. Students' feedback on the experience of
   this pedagogical approach was positive and they also shared a few
   suggestions.
   Conclusion: Flipped classroom model had no significant impact on the end
   of clerkship test scores of medical students; however, an increased
   perceived value and acceptability of this model was noted by the
   participants.},

Title = {Insiders' perceptions of the flipped classroom approach in Chinese EFL
   junior secondary schools},
Journal = {EDUCATION 3-13},
Abstract = {A large body of research has reported the various benefits that the
   flipped classroom can nurture, such as improving students' academic
   performance and enhancing their engagement. Simultaneously, researchers
   also document the potential pitfalls of this newly invented approach.
   Although mounting academic attention has been given to the study of the
   flipped classroom in assorted subjects, there is inadequate evidence
   vis-a-vis the approach in K-12 English as a foreign language (EFL)
   education, especially in the Chinese context. Therefore, this study sets
   out to examine multi-stakeholders' perceptions of this approach in
   Chinese junior secondary schools, typically serving students aged
   thirteen to fifteen. Semi-structured interviews were conducted with
   teachers, parents, and a teacher educator from a capital city, and
   students were invited to complete open-ended questionnaires. The results
   of the current research can shed light on both advantages and challenges
   regarding the implementation of the flipped classroom in Chinese EFL
   junior secondary schools. Practical solutions to the problems were
   suggested, which may serve as references for policymakers, school
   leaders, teacher educators, and teachers when introducing this approach
   in junior secondary school English classrooms.},

Title = {Effects of Flipped Classroom on Learning Outcomes and Satisfaction: An
   Experiential Learning Perspective},
Journal = {SUSTAINABILITY},
Year = {2021},
Volume = {13},
Number = {16},
Month = {AUG},
Abstract = {This article explores the flipped-classroom learning cycle and
   traditional blended-learning cycle from the experiential learning-theory
   perspective, according to which we proposed three teaching strategies:
   high-flipped classroom (high-FC), low-flipped classroom (low-FC), and
   Traditional Blended Learning (traditional BL). And, the three teaching
   strategies are adopted in the course of Enterprise Resource Planning
   System. The purpose is to investigate the effects of learning outcomes
   and satisfaction among high-FC, traditional BL, and low-FC. This
   research adopts a quasi-experimental method. The sample for the study is
   a compulsory course of the Information Management Department of the
   University of Science and Technology in Taiwan, with a total of 94
   students in two classes. There are several research conclusions. (1) The
   three groups of t test results found that there are significant
   differences in the learning outcomes of the system skills. high-FC is
   better than low-FC, low-FC is better than traditional BL, and high-FC is
   better than traditional BL. However, there are no significant
   differences in the learning outcomes of process knowledge. (2) The
   results of ANOVA testing showed that students have the highest perceived
   learning outcomes for high-FC, followed by low-FC and traditional BL.
   (3) The results of ANOVA testing showed that students have the highest
   perceived learning satisfaction in high-FC, followed by low-FC, and the
   lowest is traditional BL. (4) The t test result shows that students are
   more satisfied with preview e-learning than review e-learning. The study
   findings provide several implications. (1) It is feasible to implement
   flipped classrooms from the perspective of experiential-learning theory.
   (2) Fully flipped classrooms have practical difficulties. A partially
   flipped classroom (high-FC or low-FC) can be a feasible gradual
   strategy. (3) Flipped classrooms and e-learning support each other's
   sustainable development. (4) The flipped classroom based on experiential
   learning theoretical perspective has obtained preliminary verification
   in the ERP-system course.},

Abstract = {The study aims to examine the effect of Flipped Classroom Instruction in
   improving the paragraph writing skills of Saudi EFL students. Level-1
   Writing course (NAJM 163) students of Business College are the
   participants of the study. Two sections of the course were selected
   randomly, and control and experimental groups were formed. A
   mixed-method supported for the collection of data using pre and
   posttests for the two groups, a questionnaire, and a group discussion
   with the experimental group. The topics from the textbook were
   identified, and videos selected from YouTube are shared with the
   experimental group through the E-Learning portal of the university
   called Blackboard. The control group was taught using the traditional
   method consisting of classroom lectures and doing exercises and practice
   at home. The findings showed that there is a significant difference
   between the control and experimental groups statistically. The
   experimental group students wrote better paragraphs, and there is a
   considerable improvement in their writing. The students and the
   instructor showed a positive attitude towards Flipped Classroom
   Instruction. Therefore, the present study recommends that implementing
   flipped classroom instruction in the EFL university classrooms of Saudi
   Arabia improves paragraph writing skills of students.},

Abstract = {This study focuses on knowing the scientific production of the terms
   flipped learning and flipped classroom in specialized literature,
   determining their conceptual evolution, the most relevant topics and the
   most prolific authors. A bibliometric study has been carried out
   supported by a structural and dynamic analysis of co-words. Both terms
   have been analyzed in the Web of Science, reporting 2968 documents and
   observing a much higher production in the flipped classroom. Despite the
   fact that both terminologies are frequently used as synonyms, in the
   scientific community they are differentiated, observing different trends
   and fields of study according to the concept. The results may promote
   the search for a terminological consensus that clearly delimits the area
   covered by each concept.},

Abstract = {This paper is the record of an action research project. The purpose of
   this action research project was to evaluate the effect of a flipped
   classroom technique on pre-registration nursing students. The aim was to
   ascertain if this was a preferred method of teaching to facilitate more
   practical sessions in class. Feedback from local student surveys
   indicated that there was a need for more practical sessions in class for
   both theoretical clarity and for assessment preparation. Qualitative
   data via a survey was used to gauge the student's perception of methods
   of differing classroom delivery and a free text box enabled students to
   voice what session they felt this method was applicable to for future
   classes. Results showed that the students acknowledged the benefit of
   having theory of sessions prior to coming to class so that this can be
   applied to the practical session. Students found value in the flipped
   classroom approach as a way of supporting and enhancing practical
   in-class sessions. This was validated further by the students'
   suggestions of where to further apply this method within the unit.},

Abstract = {Flipped instruction in an undergraduate numerical methods course in the
   online, remote environment during the COVID-19 pandemic was conducted
   with and without the use of adaptive-learning lessons for pre-class
   preparation. This comparison was made to explore potential differences
   with and without adaptive software relative to exam and concept
   inventory performance and student perceptions of the classroom
   environment, learning and motivation, and benefits and drawbacks.
   Student perceptions were gathered via the College and University
   Classroom Environment Inventory (CUCEI) and a survey designed to capture
   feedback specific to flipped instruction. The analysis was made possible
   by a current NSF grant to study adaptive learning in the flipped
   classroom at three universities and extensive prior research with the
   flipped classroom and adaptive learning by the authors. Results gathered
   in the online flipped classroom with adaptive learning suggested
   positive changes in the following: classroom environmental perceptions,
   preference for flipped instruction, perceived responsibility imposed,
   motivation for independent learning, and perceived learning.
   Furthermore, based on an open-ended question, there was a significant
   decrease in the proportion of students who experienced load, burden, or
   stressors in the online flipped classroom when adaptive learning was
   available versus not. Multiple-choice exam and concept-inventory results
   were slightly higher with adaptive lessons (although not significantly
   so), with the most promising results occurring for Pell grant
   recipients. The emerging medical education literature has suggested that
   adaptive learning and flipped instruction will be key to post-pandemic
   education. The present article begins advocacy for adaptive learning
   with flipped instruction in engineering education.},

Abstract = {Application of knowledge is shown to improve student comprehension, but
   with dwindling hands-on clinical opportunities in nursing programs,
   active learning strategies need to be incorporated into classroom
   learning. Nursing faculty in an undergraduate nursing program
   transitioned from a lecture format to a flipped classroom format,
   thereby incorporating active learning. Quantitative and qualitative data
   on student performance were collected over three semesters. The
   Assessment Technologies Institute (ATI) maternal-newborn content mastery
   exam, used as the final examination for the course, was used to assess
   student academic performance. End-of-course student feedback was
   collected from the Campuslabs IDEA Student Rating of Instruction (SRI)
   evaluation to assess students' perceptions of their ability to
   understand and apply knowledge, as well as perceptions of the flipped
   classroom format in general. The ATI exam scores for the course did not
   change significantly, but the SRI showed a statistically significant
   increase in the percentage of students who felt they gained a ``deeper
   understanding{''} and could ``apply the knowledge and skills.{''}
   Although students resisted the flipped classroom format change
   initially, subsequent cohorts came to accept the change. Implications
   for educators are that although student dissatisfaction increased
   initially, the inclusion of the flipped classroom format within a course
   improved students' confidence in their ability to perform.},

Abstract = {The aim of this case study is to determine student views on the flipped
   classroom. It was conducted for nine weeks with 39 students in the
   Science Education department. The semi-structured interview technique
   was utilized during the data collection process. The content analysis
   method was used in order to analyze the data collected from the
   interviews. The findings of the research revealed that students have
   positive opinions regarding the flipped classroom. When their
   perceptions were examined, some positive aspects of the model including
   time-efficiency in the classroom, learning reinforcement, more practice
   in the classroom, time and space flexibility, revision opportunity,
   opportunity to learn at individual's own pace, permanent and active
   learning, preparing for the lesson and undertaking responsibility were
   identified. The most emphasized negative aspects of the model included
   technological inadequacy, technical problems, past habits, lack of
   proper video duration, workload and the necessity of class attendance.
   In addition, students stated that the model is viable for other courses
   and that they would prefer to use this model for their future
   profession.},

Abstract = {Abstract The flipped classroom is one of many technology-enhanced
   teaching strategies. In this approach, students are responsible for
   initial learning at home (often via instructional videos) and class time
   is used for problem-solving and activities to deepen understanding.
   Although research on and use of the flipped classroom in language
   education is growing, little work has examined its use in teacher
   education, particularly for language teachers. To address this gap, this
   study examined the flipped classroom through the eyes of pre-service
   language teachers to reveal what hinders them from or encourages them to
   adopt this approach. Data were collected from students in a
   Computer-Assisted Language Learning (CALL) course; they experienced two
   flipped class sessions (complementing the traditional instructor-led
   sessions) and completed a survey about their experiences.
   Semi-structured interviews were also conducted with a sub-set of
   students to examine their perceptions in greater depth. Three major
   themes emerged regarding benefits of the flipped classroom: learner
   autonomy, learning by doing with support, and preventing cognitive
   overload. Four challenges emerged: learners' technology access and
   technical ability, technical support for instructors, ambiguous student
   responsibility, and an inability to provide immediate clarification.
   Three additional notable themes emerged: heightened awareness of peers
   in the classroom, different reactions to content-oriented versus
   technically-oriented instructional videos, and student workload. These
   themes are discussed in detail, along with suggestions for teacher
   training and professional development. Also considered is the need to
   establish guidelines for best practices in flipped classrooms and to
   develop high-quality approaches to flipping without a dependence on
   instructional videos.},

Abstract = {Student-centered pedagogical methods have gained popularity in recent
   years. Various active learning strategies are being used at schools of
   all levels. This study describes a flipped classroom with student
   teaching strategy employed in an international business course and
   evaluates its effectiveness on student learning. With primary data of
   152 students covering two semesters before and two semesters after the
   implementation of the new strategy from 2016 to 2018, preliminary
   evidence shows that the flipped classroom with student teaching improves
   student attendance, performance, and the overall satisfaction of
   students with the course. By controlling for the other factors that
   could contribute to the improved student performance, a regression
   analysis with year fixed effects further confirms the preliminary
   evidence that flipping the classroom with student teaching improves
   students' learning and performance, which corroborates the theory of
   ``learning by teaching{''} by Dr. Jean-Pol Martin. This research
   benefits the professors who are thinking of incorporating more
   student-centered active learning activities in their teaching.},

   Students},
Journal = {WIRELESS COMMUNICATIONS \& MOBILE COMPUTING},

Abstract = {With the rapid development of information technology and the deepening
   of education reform, flipped classroom, as a new teaching mode, has
   received considerable attention from the education circle as soon as it
   appeared. This paper analyzes the teaching design principles of big data
   flipped classroom combined scenario simulation, constructs the teaching
   design model of big data flipped classroom combined scenario simulation
   in medical clinical practice, and explores the application and effect of
   the teaching method of big data flipped classroom combined scenario
   simulation. In this paper, the experimental group takes care of fusion
   simulations combined with the flipped classroom teaching method, and the
   routine control group uses the traditional teaching method; the scores
   of the two groups on theory, learning initiative, clinical practice, and
   critical thinking ability allow comparing the teaching effect,
   concluding that health care integration scenario simulation combined
   with flipped classroom teaching methods is new. It is beneficial to
   improve the learning ability, improve the ability of medical
   cooperation, enhance the sense of humanistic care, and so on. Analysis
   and comparison concludes that turning medical fusion simulations
   combined with classroom teaching, promoting the medical students on
   medical students' clinical practice to master theoretical knowledge and
   practical operation ability, and improving the ability of critical
   thinking ability and care will lead medical students to make a study of
   basic knowledge of medicine helping to cultivate the graduate student's
   study enthusiasm, stimulating interest in learning, improving the
   comprehensive quality of medical specialty, and making it worth
   popularizing in practice teaching.},

Abstract = {The flipped classroom has been shown to have positive outcomes in
   learning. However. relatively little has been reported on the
   implementation of it in dental education. The purpose of this study was
   to evaluate the impact of the flipped classroom on predoctoral dental
   students' learning. Two consecutive classes of dental students learned
   the physiology of the autonomic nervous system through the nonflipped
   (traditional lecture) or the flipped approach. Students' learning was
   assessed with an identical quiz at the end of the module. The mean score
   in the flipped approach was higher than that in the nonflipped approach
   (P < 0.01). Mean score on the content-based quiz questions in the
   flipped approach was higher than that in the nonflipped approach (P <
   0.05). Performance on case-based questions did not show a significant
   difference (P = 0.12). Mean quiz performance of the lower 27\% scorers
   in the flipped approach was higher than that in the nonflipped approach
   (P < 0.05). Mean quiz performance of the upper 27\% scorers showed an
   increase in the flipped approach as well (P < 0.05). but to a less
   extent than that of the lower 27\% scorers (P < 0.01). The flipped
   approach also increased peer collaboration (P < 0.01). In summary, the
   flipped classroom improved dental students' performance on content-based
   questions in physiology. The flipped classroom narrowed the performance
   gap between the low- and high-performing dental students.},

Abstract = {The flipped classroom method, where in-class and non-class activities
   are translocated, is accepted as one of the new generation teaching
   models. The aim of this study is to reveal students' views on the use of
   social media in the teaching process based on the flipped classroom
   approach. This study is a qualitative action research and opinions of
   the participants were taken through semi-structured individual
   interviews. The sixty found that although the initial thoughts of the
   students about the social media supported flipped classroom method were
   negative, the final and the general thoughts were positive, that it
   improved in-class! non-class communication and interaction, facilitated
   learning and increased motivation. The negative aspects of this method
   were found to be distractibility stemming from advertisements and
   notifications on social media, irrelevant negative comments, need for
   Internet connection or excessive use of internet and feeling of being
   under constant surveillance. Video ads uploaded on YouTube and the
   students' consuming to their mobile data plans tome to the fore as a
   disadvantage. The majority of the students expressed Kahoot activity as
   an incentive for watching Wens.},

Abstract = {Flipped teaching is a trend within higher education. Through flipped
   teaching the learning environment can be altered by moving the lecture
   out of the classroom through online recordings, while in-classroom
   sessions focus on active learning and engaging students in their own
   learning process. In this paper, we used focus groups comprised of male
   students in a qualitative research course with the aim of understanding
   the ways in which we might improve active student engagement and
   motivation within the flipped classroom. The findings indicated that,
   within the flipped classroom, students mix surface and deep-learning
   approaches. The online recordings, which students interact with through
   a surface approach, can function as a stepping stone toward a
   deep-learning approach to in-class activities, but only if students come
   to class prepared. The findings therefore suggest that students must be
   made aware of the importance of preparation prior to flipped classroom
   in-class activities to ensure the active learning process is successful.
   By not listening to the recordings (e.g., due to technological failure,
   as was the case in this study), students can result in only employing a
   surface approach.},

Abstract = {Technological advances have created immense pressure on our younger
   generation to keep themselves abreast with the newer developments in
   medical sciences. Educators have to evolve innovative pedagogy to help
   prepare this generation for future challenges as the training periods
   are getting relatively shorter. Flipped classroom or Inverted classroom
   is one such innovation that can empower a learner to develop critical
   thinking skills and master ways to imbibe vast information by engaging
   students in active learning process. Reading and understanding are
   carried at home, and the class-time is utilized for higher levels of
   learning like analyzing, evaluating, and application of the basic
   information. This review article is aimed to guide the educators in

Abstract = {The purpose of this study was to examine the overall effectiveness of
   the flipped classroom on students' learning achievement and motivation.
   Data were collected from three databases, which include Web of Science,
   Scopus, and Eric. The present meta-analysis synthesized the findings of
   95 studies with 15386 participants published from 2013 to 2019. The
   results revealed that the flipped classroom approach had a moderate
   effect size for learning achievement and learning motivation. The effect
   sizes of 12 moderators, including sample level, sample size, learning
   domain, the flip classroom model, research design, intervention
   duration, teaching method in the class, sample region, interactions in a
   pre-class and face-to-face class, tools in pre-class, and resources in
   pre-class were also analyzed. The results indicated that sample size,
   intervention durations, and sample regions significantly moderated the
   effect sizes. The findings of this study are discussed in-depth,
   together with the implications for practices on the use of the flipped
   classroom approach.},

Title = {Learning with technology in physiotherapy education: design,
   implementation and evaluation of a flipped classroom teaching approach},
Journal = {BMC MEDICAL EDUCATION},
Year = {2019},
Volume = {19},
Month = {JUL 31},
Abstract = {BackgroundThe purpose of the study was to describe the design,
   implementation and evaluation of a flipped classroom teaching approach
   in physiotherapy education. The flipped classroom is a blended learning
   approach in which students receive digital lectures as homework, while
   active learning activities are used in the classroom. Flipped classroom
   teaching enables a learning environment that aims to develop
   higher-order cognitive skills.MethodsThe study design was a historically
   controlled, prospective, cohort study. An eight week theoretical course
   on musculoskeletal disorders was redesigned, moving from a conventional
   approach to a flipped classroom model. Pre-class learning material
   consisted of about 12h of video lectures and other digital learning
   resources that were split up over the duration of the course. In-class
   activities consisted of seven full-day seminars where students worked in
   groups in order to solve problem-based assignments. The assignments were
   designed to reflect authentic clinical problems and required critical
   thinking and reasoning. Outcomes were measured with course-grades and
   compared with historical controls of conventional teaching, using
   descriptive statistics. Self-perceived learning outcomes and students'
   experiences were also collected in a survey.ResultsFifty-one students
   passed the course exam, two failed and one did not attend (n=54). The
   share of students with Excellent, Very good and Good (ABC) performances
   increased by more than 10\% relative to any previous year. In addition,
   Satisfactory, Sufficient and Failed performances (DEF) decreased by more
   than 10\%. Almost two thirds of the students preferred the flipped
   classroom approach as compared with conventional teaching. Interaction
   with peers and educators, and flexibility, were the most positive
   factors that were reported by students. Long seminars, time-constraints
   and low motivation with respect to preparation and educators' roles were
   the most common complaints.ConclusionsA flipped classroom approach in
   physiotherapy education resulted in improved student performances in
   this professional programme, when compared with conventional teaching.
   Students responded positively to the collaborative learning environment,
   especially with respect to the associated autonomy and flexibility.
   There were indicators that all groups did not work optimally and that
   accountability to other group members did not always ensure
   pre-classroom preparations.},

Abstract = {The objective of this study was to examine the effects of the flipped
   classroom method on the academic achievement of medical students in the
   Good Medical Practice Program, collect data on the students' opinions of
   this method, and offer solutions to some of the most commonly cited
   problems in the literature regarding its use. The research design of the
   study involves a quasi-experimental pretest-posttest design with a
   control group, and the qualitative research method for answers to
   follow-up questions. Participants in the study were 38 first-year
   students from the Faculty of Medicine of Hacettepe University. An
   academic achievement test and a semi-structured interview form were used
   as data collection instruments. Findings of the study show that the
   students taught using the flipped classroom model have higher levels of
   achievement compared with the students taught using the traditional
   method. Interviews conducted with the experimental group showed that
   these students had positive views regarding the flipped classroom
   method, and it was concluded that solutions offered to deal with the
   problems, commonly viewed as the disadvantages of the method, were
   effective.},

Abstract = {OBJECTIVE: To describe the feasibility, efficacy, and learner perception
   of the flipped classroom model for teaching conferences within surgical
   training programs.
   DESIGN: For the flipped classroom conferences, video lectures were
   prepared by a faculty member, and sent to all attendees at least 2 days
   prior to lecture. The conference time was then spent going over cases
   and questions, rather than traditional lecture. We conducted a
   qualitative survey to assess learner's perceptions and pre-lecture
   quizzes to assess trainee preparedness.
   SETTING: The comparison of pre-conference quizzes between flipped
   classroom and traditional models was carried out at Brooke Army Medical
   Center (BAMC) in San Antonio, TX, a tertiary care facility with a
   general surgery residency program. The survey was conducted at BAMC and
   within the Complex General Surgical Oncology fellowship program at
   University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center, where a flipped classroom
   model was similarly employed.
   PARTICIPANTS: Surgical residents BAMC participated in pre-lecture
   quizzes. BAMC residents and MD Anderson fellows were invited to complete
   the online survey.
   RESULTS: Lecture videos did not increase mean preparation time (1.53 vs.
   1.46 hours without vs. with video, p = 0.858), but did increase mean
   quiz scores from 67\% to 80\% (p = 0.031) with 32/35 learners utilizing
   videos. Videos increased the proportion of learners who selfreported
   preparing at all from 42\% to 95\% (p = 0.28), and preparing for at
   least one hour for conference from 23\% to 49\% (p = 0.014). Of survey
   respondents, 90\% said videos were very helpful, 90\% would use them
   weekly if available, and 90\% prefer this format to traditional lecture.
   CONCLUSIONS: Utilization of a flipped classroom method was well received
   and preferred by surgical trainees, and it increased performance on
   pre-conference quizzes without increasing preparation time. Although
   creation of video lectures is work-intensive for lecturers, these
   results suggest it is more effective for learner preparation. These
   results could be generalizable to surgical residents nationwide as
   technology utilization increases in surgical education. ((C) 2021

Title = {FACTORS WITH INFLUENCE ON THE ADOPTION OF THE FLIPPED CLASSROOM MODEL IN
   TECHNICAL AND VOCATIONAL EDUCATION},
Journal = {JOURNAL OF INFORMATION TECHNOLOGY EDUCATION-RESEARCH},
Year = {2018},
Volume = {17},
Pages = {441-469},
Abstract = {Aim/Purpose The aim of this work is to explore which factors impact on
   the adoption of the flipped classroom in vocational education to pave
   the way for the schools which want to apply this model.
   Background Although various experiences in the use of the flipped
   classroom have been reported in recent years in the literature, fewer
   efforts have been done on how to implement this model from a pedagogical
   standpoint. The factors that influence its adoption have not been
   studied in depth, at least not in a global way. These factors include
   the use of technology and teaching methodologies active in the
   classroom, the trend towards innovation of teachers and schools, and
   whether teachers have the necessary ICT training and infrastructures.
   Moreover, although the results of many experiences in Higher Education
   have been published, this is not so for other levels of education, such
   as vocational schools.
   Methodology A quantitative research method was used by constructing a
   questionnaire. The questionnaire included open questions in order to
   obtain qualitative information, which enriched the results obtained.
   Descriptive and factor analysis was used to analyze data, within the
   framework of the project FlipIT!-Flipped Classroom in the European
   Vocational Education{''}, ERASMUS+ Strategic Partnership
   (2015-1-HU01-KA202-013555) funded by the European Union, with the
   participation of Hungary, the United Kingdom, Ireland, the Czech
   Republic, and Spain. The research sample includes 625 teachers (434 from
   Spain, 121 from Hungary and 61 from the Czech Republic) from schools
   participating or somehow associated to the project.
   Contribution An empirically validated framework of the factors
   influencing the adoption of the flipped classroom approach in schools
   was obtained. This framework can guide the curriculum design of flipped
   classroom model courses for vocational education teachers.
   Findings Empirically validated factors for the adoption of the flipped
   classroom in technical schools are presented.
   In addition, descriptive analysis results from a sample of 625
   vocational education teachers confirmed that the countries involved in
   the survey fulfill the factors needed for the adoption of the flipped
   classroom in vocational education schools. Another important result is
   that, according to the surveyed teachers, the flipped classroom is a
   strongly practice-oriented method very suitable for vocational
   education.
   Recommendations for Practitioners The framework here presented can guide
   the curriculum design of flipped classroom model courses for vocational
   and technical education teachers and allow schools to know the factors
   to review and improve in order to use the model.
   Recommendations for Researchers This study is a first step toward
   determining the factors needed for the adoption of the flipped classroom
   model in vocational and technical schools. More studies using
   alternative data sources and methods are needed to obtain a definite
   model to support this adoption since FC has proved to be a very
   successful model for motivating students. We hope these results pave the
   way for schools who want to adopt the FC model and for focusing teaching
   training on the competences that this work detected.
   Impact on Society Recently, we are witnessing an important debate about
   the future of education at every level. Different innovative
   methodologies have emerged in a search for more motivating and effective
   ways to learn, as well as to develop in our students the so-called
   21st-century skills such as critical thinking, communication and
   collaboration, creativity, and information, media and technology skills.
   The flipped classroom approach can help to improve vocational education
   by changing traditional classes and teaching students other important
   soft skills, such as teamwork and collaboration, reflection, digital
   skills, and self-study.
   Future Research The model is currently being implemented in schools in
   Spain, Hungary, and the Czech Republic using the results obtained here
   under the framework of the European project ``FlipIT!-Flipped Classroom
   in the European Vocational Education{''}, ERASMUS+ Strategic Partnership
   (2015-1-HU01-KA202-013555). After checking the criteria obtained in the
   framework for each of the participating schools, as a first step, an
   online course has been created using the competences obtained in this
   framework, both pedagogical and ICT. Once the course is completed, the
   teachers will carry out a pilot project to use the model. We hope the
   framework is useful to other researchers in order to implement the model
   in other countries and extend it with other criteria to obtain a
   validated international framework. This study is a first step toward
   determining the factors needed for the adoption of the flipped classroom
   model in technical schools. More studies using alternative data sources
   and methods are needed to obtain a definite model to support this
   adoption since FC has proved to be a very successful model for
   motivating students. We hope these results pave the way for schools who
   want to adopt the FC model and for focusing teacher training on
   competences.},

Title = {Introduction to Medical Statistics Software Using the Flipped Classroom:
   A Pilot Study},
Journal = {JOURNAL OF STATISTICS AND DATA SCIENCE EDUCATION},
Abstract = {Teaching practical skills is of particular interest in the study of
   human medicine. With regard to medical statistics this means the use of
   statistical software, which may be effectively taught by a flipped
   classroom approach. As a pilot study, we designed and implemented an
   elective course on medical statistics that focused on hands-on data
   analysis in SAS Studio. Students independently prepared for class using
   materials such as pretaped asynchronous lectures, and worked on
   exercises during synchronous class sessions. On course evaluations
   completed by n = 15 students out of 26, students rated their
   satisfaction with the course a mean of 1.3 (SD 0.6) on a scale where 1 =
   best and 6 = worst. Twelve (80\%) indicated that they processed all
   materials provided, and 11 students (73\%) rated the frequency of direct
   contact with the instructor as sufficient. Nearly all (14 out of 15)
   viewed the course as an adequate substitute for a full face-to-face
   course. Our results suggest that the proposed course design is
   well-accepted. The flipped classroom format offers high flexibility and
   can be implemented easily online. Our pilot data are encouraging
   regarding the aim of designing a prospective follow-up study which
   compares the flipped classroom approach to a teaching format based on

Title = {Merging flipped classroom approaches with the 5E inquiry model: a design
   heuristic},
Journal = {INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF MATHEMATICAL EDUCATION IN SCIENCE AND
   TECHNOLOGY},
Abstract = {Most often, flipped classroom approaches in science and mathematics
   classrooms follow a traditional approach to teaching, where students
   receive direct instruction as homework and have to apply and deepen
   their knowledge in a follow-up lesson. Little is known about the
   arrangements of in-class and out-of-class phases fostering learning
   through inquiry in flipped classroom scenarios. To support teachers'
   lesson planning practices, we developed a design heuristic for flipped
   classroom scenarios based on the 5E inquiry model. We implemented this
   design heuristic in an online professional development course for
   secondary mathematics teachers and collected 18 lesson plans. To explore
   how participating teachers adopted the design heuristic in their lesson
   plans, we conducted a document analysis on our data. We identified the
   following three major categories: (a) pre out-of-class phases to engage
   students, (b) in-class phases for student-centred learning activities
   and (c) post out-of-class phases for consolidation. Furthermore, we
   analysed lesson plans with the 5E model scoring instrument. Findings
   indicate that teachers' lesson plans were mainly in line with the 5E
   model, but most participants struggled with selecting appropriate
   assessment techniques. Based on the analysis, this paper discusses
   revision decisions regarding the proposed design heuristic.},

Abstract = {Dramatic changes are expected in higher education with the emergence of
   the so-called Industry 4.0, which demands soft-skilled, autonomous
   practitioners with lifelong active learning capacity. Higher Education
   Institutions (HEIs) try to respond to this demand by redesigning and
   optimising learning experiences. Blended teaching will help to achieve
   these objectives when the methodologies required to deploy its full
   potential become available. The objective of this study is to assess
   effectiveness of blended teaching based on flipped classroom, in terms
   of student satisfaction and performance, as compared to fully online
   teaching. For that, the following questions regarding hybrid subjects
   are analysed: i) preference for hybrid subjects over fully online
   teaching; ii) satisfaction with flipped classroom as compared to
   traditional methodology; and iii) academic performance as a function of
   the learning environment. Research relied on quantitative and
   qualitative information obtained from closed surveys and focus groups
   directed to students from different HEIs, where differences among the
   means were contrasted to identify statistically significant differences
   regarding academic performance. Results indicate that the students are
   highly satisfied with the hybrid environment and the flipped classroom
   methodology. Moreover, the studies taught in this type of classrooms
   yield better success rates and improved retention as compared to fully
   online teaching. These indicators can assist HEIs in the choice of
   teaching modalities and methodologies for use in the different subjects
   of their programs.},

Abstract = {With the integration of popular technologies such as social media,
   smartphones, and tablets in the education system, new online course
   delivery methods such as flipped classrooms have emerged to enhance
   teaching and learning. To understand implications of the integration of
   such technologies in education the study examined the responses of 550
   preservice teachers. Participants took their regular classes on a
   flipped classroom during a semester. After this experience, the
   participants completed a survey instrument adapted for this study to
   measure their continuous intention to use flipped classroom. The
   research model, which is based on technology acceptance model and social
   cognitive theory, was tested by employing a structural equation
   modelling approach. Results indicated that self-regulation and
   self-efficacy have a positive impact on perceived ease of use (PEOU).
   Whereas, perceived anxiety has a negative impact on the PEOU and
   self-efficacy. Self-efficacy mediates the relationship between perceived
   anxiety and PEOU. Further, the results indicated that PEOU has a
   positive impact on perceived usefulness (PU). Both PU and PEOU have a
   positive impact on the continuous intention to use flipped classroom for
   teaching and learning. The findings suggested significant relationships
   between cognitive and technological factors and continuous intention to
   use flipped classroom.},

Abstract = {One of the main objectives of the Social Studies course is to raise
   individuals with a high level of responsibility. In this direction, many
   responsibilities are given to the students with the flipped classroom
   practices known as the replacement of the homework process at home with
   the theoretical knowledge process in the classroom and increase their
   academic success. The aim of this study is to investigate the effect of
   flipped classroom practices on students' academic achievement and
   responsibility levels in 5th-grade Social Studies course. The research
   was carried out according to the embedded experimental design which is
   one of the mixed-method designs. The study group consists of 5th-grade
   students studying in the 2018-2019 academic year in two different
   classes designated as experimental and control groups of a public
   secondary school in the middle socioeconomic level and Social Studies
   teacher of these classes. The data were obtained with the Student
   Responsibility Scale, academic achievement test and semi-structured
   interviews. As a result of the research, it was found that flipped
   classroom practices significantly increased the academic achievement and
   responsibility levels of the students in the experimental group.
   Teachers and students emphasized that e-learning videos had a
   significant effect on the increase in achievement and responsibility
   level. It is suggested that the flipped classroom practice can be used
   to imrove students' responsibility and academic achievement levels.},

Abstract = {This article presents a research that aims to reflect of an flipped
   classroom as an active methodology and the changes and impacts of its
   use for the teaching and learning process. As a research procedure, a
   literature review was carried out. The essence of the flipped classroom
   is to invert the arrangement of traditional education, in a correlation
   between moments at a distance and in the classroom. The purpose is to
   obtain the best use of time and space in the classroom, encouraging the
   active student, with reflective thinking and greater interaction between
   students and between them and the teacher.},

Abstract = {In this study, a flipped classroom was compared with blended learning
   and face-to-face learning environments and the aim was to identify the
   effect of these learning environments on students' achievements,
   academic engagement and satisfaction levels. Based on this aim, one
   control and two experimental groups were formed. The students in
   Experiment-I learned the theoretical aspect of the course through the
   materials in the online learning environment which were prepared prior
   to the class study time in context with the ``flipped classroom{''}. The
   students in Experiment-II learned the theoretical aspect of the course
   in the classroom in accordance with the blended learning model and
   fulfilled active learning activities out of class study time. The
   students in the control group learned the theoretical aspect of the
   course in the classroom according to the current curriculum and
   conducted active learning activities at their homes. It was found that
   the scores for the students in the experimental groups with regard to
   academic achievement and engagement were higher than the scores for
   those in the control group and the differences between the groups were
   statistically significant. It was revealed that the students were also
   generally satisfied with the flipped classroom.},

Journal = {JOURNAL OF UNIVERSITY TEACHING AND LEARNING PRACTICE},

Abstract = {The flipped classroom aims to improve learning by engaging students in
   educational activities outside of traditional lessons. Flipped
   classrooms have steadily gained popularity in the last decade and are a
   topic of discussion in teaching and learning forums. However, its
   adoption in mathematics and statistics has been subdued. Most higher
   education mathematics and statistics are still delivered through
   traditional lectures where students are passive participants. In this
   study, experiences of flipping a large first-level statistics class are
   presented. The implementation included a combination of peer learning
   and tutor-assistance in lectures. Student performance, in the form of
   final examination and overall marks over four semesters (two with
   traditional delivery and two flipped), were analysed for differences
   with respect to the two teaching modes after adjusting for demographic
   differences. In addition, student survey data were analysed with a view
   to revealing any relationship between attitude towards a flipped
   classroom and performance. The results showed that students' performance
   improved and an increased understanding of concepts was achieved through
   the flipped classroom approach. Evidence also indicated an increase in
   learner engagement. Student feedback indicated a higher preference for a
   flipped mode overall and in particular for ages 20 and below.},

Abstract = {The present research aimed to seek the effects of flipped classrooms on
   improving Iranian EFL learners' listening comprehension. To this aim, 40
   intermediate students were chosen based on an Oxford Quick Placement
   Test (OQPT) and they were assigned to a flipped classroom (experimental
   group) and at traditional classroom (control group). After running a
   pretest of listening comprehension, the listening materials were
   presented to the participants in the flipped classroom through the
   Internet and computer, while the participants in the control group were
   deprived of the mentioned facilities. At the end of the treatment which
   lasted for 10 sessions, 50 minutes each session, a listening
   comprehension test was administered as posttest. In addition, an
   interview was administered among the participants in the experimental
   group. The results revealed significant differences in learning English
   listening comprehension and critical thinking between both groups in
   favor of the experimental group. The study recommended the necessity of
   implementing flipped classroom in teaching and learning English
   listening comprehension to bring about better outcomes in students'
   achievement. Flipped learning requires L2 learners to be autonomous at
   home and collaborate in class.},

Abstract = {This paper presents results of an investigation between the
   theoretical-practical flipped classroom approach and the knowledge and
   actions of university teachers through the availability of instructional
   didactic material. It is a quantitative and quantitative exploratory
   study that describes the degree of familiarity with the theme and the
   necessity of continuing education identified by the participants, which
   occurred by the application of a conceptual test and questionnaire. The
   results point out an understanding of the presented concepts, and a
   partial understanding about the flipped classroom aspects among the
   teaching practices, as most of the participants did not know well this
   teaching strategy. In addition, the needs survey identified the interest
   in continuing education about teacher's active learning and blended
   methodologies. The approaches that aroused most interest of the
   participants during a flipped classroom class were Just-in-Time Teaching
   and Peer Instruction. In relation to the technological tools to be used
   in class, the results found out that the interactive whiteboard as well
   as the audio/video editing and screen capture software are the mainly
   tools interest of the audience.},

Abstract = {This study aimed to measure the effectiveness of a proposed program in
   developing practices and modifying beliefs of practitioner teachers
   about the flipped classroom. To this end, the author followed a true
   experimental design, wherein the experimental group received training
   through the proposed program, whereas the control group received none,
   and after the treatment the participants were invited to run a posttest.
   A total of 50 female students were selected randomly from the Department
   of Islamic Studies, Prince Sattam Bin Abdulaziz University. To measure
   the post-performance of the two groups, the author used an observation
   card and a scale of beliefs on the flipped classroom. The findings of
   the study revealed (a) statistically significant differences between the
   mean scores of the two groups on the observation card in favor of the
   experimental group, indicating a strong effect of the proposed program
   on developing the teachers' practices of the flipped classroom; (b)
   statistically significant differences between the mean scores of two
   groups on the scale of belief in favor of the experimental group,
   indicating a strong effect of the proposed program on modifying
   teachers' beliefs about the flipped class; and (c) a positive
   statistical correlation at .05 between the teachers' practices and
   beliefs about the flipped classroom.},

Title = {Does the teaching-learning model based on the flipped classroom improve
   academic results of students at different educational levels?},
Journal = {REVISTA COMPLUTENSE DE EDUCACION},

Abstract = {The teaching-learning model that still predominates in higher education
   is the traditional one, based on the master class taught by the teacher.
   However, it is necessary to resort to other models of teaching and
   learning that are more flexible and active for students. For this
   reason, the main objective of this paper is to apply the flipped
   classroom teaching-learning model in order to test and compare if the
   academic results of students with the flipped classroom model improve
   with respect to the traditional model at different educational levels.
   In addition, the students' assessment of this teaching-learning model
   and the use of Information and Communication Technologies is analyzed.
   This study presents the experience of teaching innovation based on the
   inverted class model, which has been carried out with 155 students
   belonging to different educational levels and with six subjects related
   to the Financial Economics discipline. For this, a descriptive
   statistical analysis is performed, as well as analysis of contingency
   tables to detect the degree of association between the educational level
   and the teaching-learning model applied for the evaluation of the
   students. Evidence is obtained that university students obtain better
   academic results with the traditional model, while non-university
   students achieve better grades with the flipped classroom model.
   However, the students' assessment of the flipped classroom model has
   been very positive, regardless of educational level. The results suggest
   that the flipped classroom model improves the academic results of
   non-university students because they are more accustomed to the
   application of new technologies than university students.},

Abstract = {Objective: The aim of this study was to examine whether the flipped
   classroom method enhances the quality of students' learning by exploring
   the change in students' processes of understanding, their relation to
   study success, and students' experiences of the course.
   Methods: A mass pharmacokinetics course, comprising 148 second-year
   pharmacy students was transformed by using the flipped classroom method.
   Students answered a `HowULearn' questionnaire in their first and last
   lecture before (n=126) and after the course (n=100) to measure their
   processes of understanding. Paired sample t-test, chi-square test and
   correlation analysis were used to analyse the change in students'
   scores, examine the relationship between the scales, and course grade.
   Students' experiences of the course were examined with open-ended
   questions, and these responses were analysed using qualitative content
   analysis.
   Results: The response rate to the first and second questionnaire was
   68\%. Surface-level processing statistically decreased significantly (t=
   3.72; p <0.001) and deep-level processing increased (t= -2.34; p= 0.022)
   during the course. The proportion of students scoring low on deep-level
   processing was smaller and the percentage of students representing high
   on surface-level processing was smaller during the course. At the end of
   the course, surface-level processing was negatively related to exam
   points (r= -0.34; p= 0.003). Deep-level processing (p= 0.82) and
   surface-level processing (p= -0.11) were not statistically significantly
   related to course grade at the beginning of the course. According to
   students' experiences the new course design, including pre-lecture
   tasks, supported their learning with 63 students out of 84 (75\%)
   students reporting feeling this way.
   Conclusions: The study showed that the flipped classroom approach
   resulted in decreased surface-level and increased deep-level processing.
   This suggests that the flipped classroom method can improve students'
   processes of understanding.},

Title = {Comparing the Effects of Traditional Teaching and Flipped Classroom
   Methods on Midwifery Students' Practical Learning: The Embedded Mixed
   Method},
Journal = {TECHNOLOGY KNOWLEDGE AND LEARNING},
Abstract = {Higher-level learning goals can be achieved almost only through teaching
   methods which actively involve students in their learning. This study
   aimed to compare the effects of traditional teaching and flipped
   classroom methods on midwifery students' practical learning. This
   embedded mixed method study was conducted on 34 first-year midwifery
   students in 2017-2018 academic year in Babol city (one of the largest
   cities in northern Iran). The contents of the four sessions of a course
   called the principles and techniques of midwifery were prepared for both
   flipped classroom and traditional teaching methods and provided to
   students using the crossover design. All students were selected by
   census and randomly divided into two groups. The students' attitudes
   towards both teaching methods were assessed at the beginning and also
   the end of the study intervention, while their satisfaction, knowledge
   and practice were assessed one month after intervention. In the second
   phase (qualitative study), the student's perspective about the
   weaknesses and the strengths of the both teaching methods were explored
   using the open-ended questions. Quantitative data were analyzed using
   SPSS and qualitative data with conventional content analysis. Flipped
   classroom method was significantly more effective than traditional
   teaching in improving midwifery students' knowledge and practice. They
   also had significantly better attitude and more satisfaction with it (P
   < 0.05). The strengths of flipped classroom were promotion of learning,
   consolidation of learning, unlimited opportunity for learning, and
   interactive learning. This study suggests that flipped classroom method
   promotes practical learning and leads to positive learning among the
   midwifery students.},

Abstract = {Nowadays due to the technologies influence is essential the acquisition
   of digital and media literacy, specifically for teachers during the
   teacher training period. The Flipped Classroom is one of the pedagogical
   models that are revolutionizing the field of education. The current
   research paper tries to analyse the perception of the students who used
   Flipped Classroom in this experience and how is their effect on the
   acquisition of digital and media literacy.
   Due to the characteristics and size of the students group we decided to
   use a qualitative methodology based on studies of case taking as a unit
   of analysis a matter of the teacher training double degree. As an
   instrument for collecting information we opted for Grounded Theory
   method directed based on questions with open answers, and for analysis
   of the data obtained.
   The results show that the Flipped Classroom model influences positively
   on the digital and media literacy grade as students: interpreting
   audiovisual information, creating and disseminating digital content,
   criticizing and analyzing the use of ICT, teaching strategies to use
   technology in the classroom, among others. The most valued aspects in
   the methodological design of the model in the promotion of these skills
   are: the audiovisual material about the content, the practical
   activities developed teamwork and the direct help of the teacher in the
   classroom.},

Title = {How Can Flipped Classroom Approach Support the Development of University
   Students' Working Life Skills?-University Teachers' Viewpoint},
Journal = {EDUCATION SCIENCES},

Abstract = {Higher education students need both generic skills and field-specific
   knowledge in order to cope with the diverse demands of working life. The
   aim of this study was to gain a better understanding of the development
   of university students' working life skills and of how these skills can
   be developed in learning environments utilizing the flipped classroom
   approach. The focus was on the experiences and thoughts of higher
   education teachers concerning which learning environment features
   support the development of working life skills. Altogether, 22 higher
   education teachers from a Finnish university were interviewed with
   semistructured interviews, and the data was subjected to content
   analysis. The results indicated that teachers identified several generic
   and field-specific working life skills, the most important of which were
   collaboration, communication, information literacy, and skills related
   to career and responsibilities. The flipped classroom appeared to
   support students' active role and facilitate versatile ways of learning.
   Especially, cooperative and active learning were identified to be the
   key means to support the development of students' working life skills in
   flipped classroom environments. Facilitating students' opportunities to
   develop their working life skills can be seen as an integral part of
   flipped classroom environments in many ways. However, it is important
   that the opportunities are actively promoted, and conceptual and
   practical tools are provided for the student through university studies.},

   classroom setting},
Journal = {INTERACTIVE LEARNING ENVIRONMENTS},
Abstract = {This study investigates the impact of providing teacher feedback on
   answers to guiding questions in the online environment of a flipped
   classroom setting. Participants were second year bachelor students
   enrolled in the ``Invertebrates{''} courses (N = 104) at the School of
   Education in CanTho University (Vietnam), and were randomly assigned to
   two research conditions: (1) With extra feedback (WEF,n = 52) and (2) No
   extra feedback (NEF,n = 52) in a flipped classroom setting. One way
   repeated measure ANOVA was used to analyze learning performance,
   self-efficacy beliefs, and appreciation of feedback. The findings
   reflect significantly higher learning performance of students studying
   in the WEF-condition. In addition, significant changes were observed in
   their self-efficacy beliefs and appreciation of feedback.},

Journal = {ETR\&D-EDUCATIONAL TECHNOLOGY RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT},
Abstract = {The objective has been to know the impact of the flipped classroom
   methodology on the academic performance of students during their
   training process in relation to the traditional methodology over time,
   in order to establish baselines in the academic grades in both models.
   The research is of a quasi-experimental type of non-equivalent groups,
   with a longitudinal trend design in the data collection process. The
   entire available population has been selected, with 1.236 students
   participating, exploring the grades as an analytical resource, from the
   2010/2011 to the 2019/2020 academic years. The results show
   statistically significant differences in the improvement of academic
   performance with the flipped classroom methodology. Furthermore, the
   results reinforce that the flipped teaching model effectively promotes
   students' interest, their capacity for autonomous learning and personal
   and cooperative relationships.},

Abstract = {In a flipped classroom, students engage in active learning during class
   time and have individual information-transmission outside class time.
   University students need to complete the pre/post-class activities to
   fully benefit from flipped classroom. It is important that teachers
   adopt practical methods including teacher-student out-of-classroom
   communication (OCC) to help students manage their time effectively and
   stay on task. This research examines the practice of OOC in a flipped
   first-year postgraduate Business Law course at an Australian university
   that comprises a large overseas student cohort. By means of a
   questionnaire, the researcher collected data about student perceptions
   of OCC, their motives for engaging in OCC, and the change of the motives
   in a flipped classroom. Student demographics, online participation, and
   academic performance data were exported from the university database.
   The student answers, participation, and performance were measured and
   compared with t-tests. The preliminary results show that in a flipped
   classroom, students were more motivated to engage in OCC. Moreover, the
   short-term online participation improved for the students who were
   communicated by the teacher outside classroom. However, an analysis of
   the data indicated no statistically significant difference in students'
   academic performance. In the concluding sections of this paper, the
   limitations of this study are acknowledged, followed by several
   recommendations for future research.},

Abstract = {Flipped classroom is an educational methodology whereby students
   complete the most theoretical part of a lesson at home, usually by
   viewing educational videos or using other similar tools. This allows
   them to dedicate more class time to developing higher order thinking
   skills via the completion of practical tasks. Since its introduction in
   the classroom few years ago, the number of primary education teachers
   using the method has increased steadily, but teachers sometimes lack
   reliable data on its effectiveness. The objective of this research was
   to address this by analysing how the methodology affects primary
   education students' self-concept. To this end, data were collected on
   822 students (Age = 10.84; SD = .873), who were divided into a control
   group (437 students) and an experimental group (385 students). The
   experimental group underwent a 7-month flipped classroom intervention.
   Both groups completed the AF-5 scale before and after the intervention.
   The results suggest, firstly, that the flipped classroom methodology
   neither significantly improved nor significantly worsened any of the
   dimensions of self-concept more than the group that did not apply this
   methodology. Meanwhile, however, both groups did show improvements in
   the social, emotional and family dimensions of their self-concept. The
   paper concludes with a discussion of these outcomes and suggestions for
   future research topics.},

Title = {Teaching cross-cultural management: A flipped classroom approach using
   films},
Journal = {INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF MANAGEMENT EDUCATION},
Year = {2018},
Volume = {16},

Abstract = {A film, as a tool for classroom learning, can be an effective teaching
   method to introduce experiential learning in the cross-cultural
   management classroom. In cases where actual exposure to other cultures
   is not feasible, films can be a medium of simulation to immerse oneself
   in a different culture. This paper explores the use of popular feature
   films for teaching cross-cultural management using the flipped classroom
   approach. Along with listing the process and structure of the flipped
   classroom, we provide a list of 101 films that can be used to teach
   cross-cultural skills. Using content analysis, we provide a short
   summary and the intercultural themes depicted in each of the films.
   Additionally, every film is also mapped across one of the GLOBE clusters
   of cultures. This enables not only teaching of intercultural concepts,
   but also allows instructors to choose a particular societal culture to
   explore. Additional recommendations are provided to customize the
   classroom procedure as per the teaching constraints and the learning
   objectives.},

Abstract = {Research has revealed the positive effects of flipped classroom
   approaches on students' learning engagement and performance compared
   with conventional lecture-based classrooms. However, because of a lack
   of out-of-class learning support, many students fail to comprehensively
   prepare the provided lecture materials before class. One promising
   solution to this problem is recommendation systems in the educational
   area, which have been instrumental in helping learners identify useful
   and relevant lecture materials that satisfy their learning needs. Thus,
   in this study, we propose a summarized lecture material recommendation
   system, which is integrated into an e-book reading system as an
   enhancement of the flipped classroom approach. This system helps
   students identify pages that contain essential knowledge that must be
   thoroughly studied before class. The proposed system was constructed on
   the basis of our previous work. In this study, a quasi-experiment was
   conducted in a graduate course that implemented the flipped classroom
   model: experimental group students learned with the proposed system,
   whereas the control group students had no access to the additional
   features. The findings of this study suggest that students who learn
   with the proposed recommendation system significantly outperform those
   who learn without the system in a flipped classroom in terms of their
   learning outcomes and engagement in preclass preparation.},

Abstract = {Flipped Classroom methodology has strongly introduced in the classrooms
   of different educational levels, but above all in the University. This
   methodology could be defined as the reversal of roles in the classroom,
   where the student acquires theoretical knowledge outside of the
   classroom and becomes a space for resolving doubts and cooperative work.
   Thus, this paper analyzes the experience carried out at the University
   of Granada with students of the Master's Degree in Secondary School
   Training where Flipped Classroom methodology has been applied. The
   research methodology used is quantitative, so that an ad hoc
   questionnaire on a Likert scale was used to obtain the data. Among the
   obtained results, it is observed that the students perceive an
   improvement in their academic performance and the improvement of the
   different personal and social skills. Finally, it can be concluded that
   this kind of experiences where the Flipped Classroom methodology is
   applied favors the development of skills depending of subject taught and
   the field of knowledge.},

Abstract = {Many proponents of flipped classrooms have sought to develop innovative
   approaches in order to advance the knowledge base of effective
   practices. In this study, a gamified flipped classroom approach is thus
   proposed to help teachers design and incorporate classroom activities
   that can be engaging to students. The proposed approach combines the
   advantages of flipped classrooms and game-based learning, leveraging the
   use of technology-enhanced board games (TEBGs) to nurture student
   engagement. What distinguishes the TEBGs from common board games is the
   integration of Quick Response (QR) codes to deliver digital content via
   mobile technology. The research results suggest that the proposed
   approach is beneficial for English-language learners by reducing their
   anxiety about speaking English in class and enhancing their motivation
   to take part in classroom activities. It is thus hoped that more
   enthusiastic teachers will become early adopters of the gamified flipped
   classroom approach.},

Abstract = {The learner-centered teaching concept and the flipped classroom teaching
   method are effectively combined to become an important mode for today's
   mixed teaching reform. The ``rain classroom{''} has provided an
   effective platform for the combination of the two. First of all, we use
   the ``rain classroom{''} teaching platform and take a course as an
   example to study the learner-centered flipped classroom teaching reform
   design. The main teaching methods are grading of ability level,
   after-school study group, case study, and online and classroom
   interactive Q\&A. Secondly, through the investigation of students'
   learning ability and willingness to learn, the teaching framework is
   designed to be suitable for students to learn and for teachers to teach
   students according to their aptitude. Finally, by paying attention to
   the real-time feedback of the effect of students using the flipped
   classroom, this paper proposes problems that should be paid attention to
   when implementing the flipped classroom. The results show that the
   course has been successful after its setup and implementation. The
   learner-centered teaching method, which respects the ability level
   classification of learning initiative, can complement the after-class
   content with the classroom content, and effectively improve the teaching
   and learning effects.},

Abstract = {In this research, it is aimed to examine the graduate theses done about
   flipped classroom model in Turkey according to some variables. The data
   of this descriptive study which was conducted by a qualitative research
   approach was obtained from 105 master's and doctoral theses accessed
   from CoHE National Thesis Center database. The data were collected
   through document analysis and the data were analyzed by content analysis
   technique. According to the findings, it is determined that the theses
   were mostly done in 2019, most of the theses were made at Gazi
   University, the number of master's theses was more numerous, the studies
   conducted to examine the effect of flipped classroom model applications
   on various variables predominate, the model is mostly called as
   ``Flipped classroom model{''} as in this study and mostly preferred in
   foreign language education, and in the part where the model is applied
   at home the most preferred online software is Edmodo. In addition, it
   was determined that mostly mixed methods were preferred as the research
   method, university students as sample group, interview form/questions as
   data collection tool, and ``t test{''} in data analysis. At the end of
   the research, suggestions were made for researchers and for
   practitioners.},

Abstract = {This study explored the effect of learning strategies in a student
   organization on cake art creativity. The participants were 27 student
   members of a cake decorating art club from one central university in
   Taiwan. A quasi-experimental pretest-posttest design was adopted, with
   90 h of experimental teaching over 16 weeks. The results, which included
   the use of a questionnaire, classroom observation, and in-depth
   interviews, suggest that in terms of creativity, the group participating
   in flipped classroom learning significantly outperformed the group using
   traditional learning strategies. Furthermore, flipped classroom learning
   promoted learner motivation and satisfaction.},

Abstract = {Despite the popularity of the flipped classroom, its effectiveness in
   achieving greater engagement and learning outcomes currently lacks
   substantial empirical evidence. This study analyzed the contributions of
   54 students who participated in an inverted teaching environment in the
   Double Degree in Physical Activity and Sports Sciences (Melilla,
   University of Granada), specifically in the subject of Biomechanics of
   Human Movement. A study with a qualitative approach was selected based
   on the contributions of the students through a reflective diary
   completed throughout the semester and semi-structured interviews. In
   general, students reported a more positive learning experience and
   greater participation in the flipped classroom. The analysis revealed
   six categories that students highlight as especially conducive to their
   learning; engagement with peers, being recognized, relationship with the
   teacher, physical learning environment, learning with peers and using
   videos to learn new content. The results indicate that the affective
   dimension of student participation is particularly prominent when
   students reflect on learning in the flipped classroom.},

Abstract = {This article aims to report on an experiment of the flipped classroom in
   language learning at the ISSAE-Cnam of the Lebanese University. It was
   to realize three macro-tasks: a capsule, an HTML page, a presentation
   via Google Slides, by following three steps: the discovery phase
   (distance-learning), the analysis and deepening phase (face-to-face and
   as a group) and the production, evaluation and readjustment phase
   (face-to-face and distance-learning individually and in groups).The
   results are conclusive: the students are involved in the project. They
   became aware of how they learned and carried out tasks in a spirit of
   sharing and collaboration. These observations, however, do not prevent
   us from deducing that the flipped classroom is a double-edged sword: it
   can motivate young people curious about novelties, addicted to new
   technologies, but it can also be a source of trouble if it is poorly
   prepared. and misused. Indeed, the investment in energy and time from
   the protagonists is hardly neglected. Therefore, the conventional class
   can not be substituted by the flipped classroom, it is the right balance
   between these two approaches that will make all the difference.},

Abstract = {Today, technologies are utilized extensively to support the process of
   learning according to learner needs. Hence, the advances in technology
   and ideology have prompted new directions in the second language (L2)
   instructional practices. This study is carried out in regard to the
   usage of infographics in a flipped classroom learning environment called
   ?Flipped Classroom Instructional Infographics?. The goal of the research
   is to assess the perceptions and evaluate the achievements of ESL
   students in learning English language through flipped classroom
   instructional infographics. The study is designed as a case study and
   uses a mixed research method (quantitative and qualitative) in order to
   obtain the result in a more consistent manner. The data are gathered
   from 130 students by means of a questionnaire and a focus group
   interview is conducted to explore the ?students' perceptions of
   infographics?, ?students' perceptions of the FCII learning environment?
   and ?students' academic achievements level?. The findings of the study
   indicate that students' motivations in the experimental group compared
   to the control group are more triggered by the engaging and
   comprehensive nature of flipped classroom instructional infographics,
   meaning that they could absorb the concepts easier, memorize the
   information faster, and become more confident in the educational
   process.},

Abstract = {In a flipped classroom model, learning of basic content is shifted
   before class while in-class time is used for concept application.
   Empirical and controlled research studies are lacking on the best
   strategies to provide the necessary pre-class content instruction. In
   this study, we tested three methods of pre-class content
   learninginteractive online tutorials, video lectures, and textbook-style
   readingswhile holding the content and the in-class application
   activities constant. Identical introductory, non-majors biology classes
   were manipulated at both a public, open-enrollment institution and a
   private, highly selective institution. We found that video lectures
   offer a small advantage to overall student learning over interactive
   tutorials or textbook-style readings. Although our two populations
   differed in their ability to effectively learn from pre-class
   activities, through a student-centered flipped classroom approach,
   students at both institutions demonstrated equal learning gains by the
   final assessment. Potential reasons for some observed differences are
   suggested.},

Title = {Designing flipped classroom using Kemp's instructional model to enhance
   deep learning and self-directed collaborative learning of basic science
   concepts},

Abstract = {BACKGROUND: The flipped classroom pedagogy allows students to introduce
   a topic and gather their own meanings outside of the classroom, then
   explore the topic and create their meanings or exclude their
   misconceptions during class. Our aim was to enhance the ability of
   self-directed learning (SDL) among medical undergraduates. Pedagogical
   benefits of the model are highlighted along with potential challenges to
   its use. Material and Methods: Kemp's Instructional model was used to
   design flipped classroom. Need analysis was done to assess the
   perceptions of the students on the current teaching practices and their
   expectations for adoption of innovative methods. Validation of content
   was done by Delphi method by subject experts across the institutions.
   Content included objectives; case scenarios and extended multiple choice
   questions. Students were divided into two groups. Group A and Group B,
   50 in each. A topic was given 1 week prior and both groups were
   subjected to a pretest to identify their self-study performance. Group A
   was exposed to 4 sessions of flipped classroom. They were provided with
   PowerPoint slides with voice recordings. In the classroom, first 30 min
   was meant for quiz and next 30 min was meant to clarify the doubts.
   Group B were exposed to the 4 regular lecture sessions. Both the groups
   were subjected to the posttest and test after 4 weeks. Later with
   another topic, flipped classroom was conducted for all the 100 students
   and the feedback was taken from all the students and faculty using a
   validated questionnaire. RESULTS: Posttest scores of students who were
   flipped were statistically significant (p < 0.001). Most (98\%) students
   opined that these interactive sessions evoked interest in the topic.
   Flipped classroom sessions were found to be effective in improving
   students' learning behavior toward SDL, collaborative learning skills
   and critically analyzing the basic concepts. CONCLUSIONS: By following a
   systematic process (Kemp's instructional Model, it is possible to design
   need-based flipped classroom sessions. They are found to be effective in
   improving students' learning behavior toward deep learning,
   self-efficacy, SDL, collaborative learning skills, critically analyzing
   the basic concepts. In a flipped classroom, ``the learning environment
   transforms into a dynamic and more social space where students can
   participate in critiques or work through problems in teams.},

Abstract = {The flipped classroom has gained much attention for its pedagogical
   success in higher education. However, continued use of this
   technology-supported instructional approach has been problematic. To
   support the success and continuation of flipped classroom
   implementation, this study employs structural equation modeling
   techniques to examine the relationships between five key factors of
   influence (computer self-efficacy, perceived technological pedagogical
   content knowledge, perceived ease of use, perceived usefulness,
   perceived organizational support) and instructors' continued use
   intention. The results identify that instructors' perceived
   organizational support and perceived technological pedagogical content
   knowledge are the only factors examined that directly impact continued
   use intention. Instructors' technological pedagogical content knowledge
   also mediates between perceived organizational support and computer
   self-efficacy to continued use intention. These findings provide
   empirical evidence of such relationships and indicate that personal
   beliefs regarding technology itself are not the strongest factors
   influencing the continued use of flipped classroom instruction. Rather,
   instructors' beliefs relating to their environmental surroundings and
   personal knowledge regarding technology usage for instructional purposes
   are the key factors of instructors' continued use intention in Chinese
   higher education.},

Title = {Flipped classroom frameworks improve efficacy in undergraduate practical
   courses - a quasi-randomized pilot study in otorhinolaryngology},
Journal = {BMC MEDICAL EDUCATION},
Year = {2018},
Volume = {18},
Month = {DEC 4},
Abstract = {Background: Curriculum design and specific topic selection for on-site
   practical courses in clinical disciplines with limited teaching time is
   challenging. An electronic learning supported curriculum based on the
   flipped classroom principle has a high potential to effectively gain
   knowledge and education along with improving practical experience. Here,
   we demonstrate the introduction of a flipped classroom curriculum for
   practical courses in Otorhinolaryngology (ORL) in real world practice to
   improve the on-site time management and students' experience.
   Methods: Educational aims of our practical curriculum were analysed and
   rearranged into a flipped classroom (FC) framework. Core knowledge was
   taught preliminary based on a moodle platform in predominantly
   interactive formats. Two quasi-randomized groups were formed with 212
   participants either receiving or not receiving access to the e-learning
   program to reduce a potential allocation bias to the e-learning group.
   All students completed a questionnaire with learning related items.
   Focusing the study on the intervention group, we investigated if
   students using the flipped classroom more often felt better prepared for
   the practical course.
   Results: The online learning platform was highly accepted and frequently
   used by 66\% of participating students in the e-learning group. Students
   with frequent use of our e-learning platform significantly felt better
   prepared for the practical course (p = 0.001). The far majority of all
   students supports the idea of further development of e-learning. More
   than 70\% were generally interested in ORL. Handouts were the overall
   most important learning resource and more than 50\% relied solely on
   them.
   Conclusions: Flipped classroom curricula can save time and help
   improving the on-site experience in practical courses especially in
   smaller surgical disciplines. The acceptance of digital learning is
   high, and most students rely on handouts for learning ORL, emphasizing
   the need for guidance by the teacher e.g. through electronic learning.
   Our results underline the high potential of FC to address teaching
   challenges for smaller medical disciplines with limited teaching time
   like ORL.},

Abstract = {As a result of the confinement due to the COVID-19 pandemic, various
   educational institutions migrated their face-to-face teaching modality
   to a virtual modality. This article presents the implementation of the
   Flipped Classroom model in a completely virtual format to develop
   grammatical competency in Spanish. The model used videos from YouTube,
   one of the leading global social network platforms, and the
   videoconferencing system Zoom, the tool selected by the studied
   educational institution to continue academic operations during the
   health confinement. The model was enriched with the Index for Learning
   Style test to provide more differentiated teaching. This study showed
   considerable improvement in the academic performance of high school
   students taking a Spanish course at the Mexico City campus of
   Tecnologico de Monterrey. Of the total sample, 98\% increased their
   score by between 2 and 46 points, from a total of 100, in their
   grammatical competency in Spanish. Additionally, the student
   satisfaction survey showed that more than 90\% considered the course
   methodology beneficial for developing their grammatical competency in
   Spanish. This study demonstrates the potential of the Flipped Classroom
   model in a virtual format. This teaching structure using the Flipped
   Classroom model could be replicated in various educational settings and
   for different areas of knowledge.},

Abstract = {Universities are facing many challenges with growing student numbers and
   a need to modify the traditional lecture and tutorial-based face-to-face
   pedagogical style both for students who work full-time while studying
   and for international students who may have language difficulties. To
   address these challenges, a flipped classroom pedagogical model was
   trialled in a second-year module in a Construction Management
   undergraduate degree program. The model consisted of preclass online
   quizzes, in-class face-to-face lectures, group tasks, active learning
   spaces, adaptive online tutorials and a case-based assessment.
   Evaluation findings suggest that preclass activities are an important
   feature of a flipped classroom to actively engage students in
   independent learning and to help them construct their own knowledge.
   Findings also highlight the significance of physical space to facilitate
   collaboration and interactions between students, improve their learning
   experience, and inspire students to learn in an active environment. The
   findings have implications for both educational developers and academics
   to support the development of open, online, and blended learning courses
   and to deploy, implement, and evaluate higher education courses.},

Abstract = {To stimulate classroom interactions, this study employed two different
   smartphone application modes, providing an additional instant
   interaction channel in a flipped classroom teaching fundamental computer
   science concepts. One instant interaction mode provided the students (N
   = 36) with anonymous feedback in chronological time sequence, while the
   other showed their feedback by ``like{''} ranking (N = 26). The
   behavioural patterns of undergraduates using these two different modes
   were compared. The results showed that the like-ranked feedback deepened
   the interaction between asking and answering questions, reduced the
   number of irrelevant messages, and increased attention to questionable
   messages. The students using the like-ranking mode also received more
   encouragement during the flipped classroom discussion activities.},

Abstract = {This paper chooses 144 students as subjects to conduct a flipped
   classroom experiment teaching. The results show that before the
   experiment students from the experimental class and control class
   universally lack English learning interest, have no habit of preparing
   lessons before class and are short of consciousness of autonomous
   learning. However, after the experiment, it is found that score of the
   experimental class is significantly higher than that of the control
   class. Furthermore, students' learning attitude, interest and habit,
   autonomous learning ability, cooperative learning consciousness and
   degree of satisfaction for learning English in the experimental class
   are higher than those of the control class. Therefore, it suggests that
   the flipped classroom teaching mode can effectively stimulate students'
   interest in learning English, develop their autonomous and cooperative
   learning abilities, enhance their English learning proficiency and
   influence the development of English learning attitude and habit
   actively.},

Abstract = {Many studies have explored the benefits of flipped classrooms in
   language learning, but a further investigation on the link between
   mobile-assisted flipped classrooms and EFL teacher candidates'
   engagement in learning in an Indonesian context is needed. This research
   aimed at elaborating on how the implementation of mobile-assisted
   flipped classroom engaged EFL teacher candidates. With this goal in
   mind, we employed a case study design aiming at giving a holistic
   description of the case. It included multiple sources of data from
   online archives, observations, questionnaires, and Focus Group
   Discussion (FGD). We investigated the roles of the teacher and the
   students in the implementation of a mobile-assisted flipped classroom.
   The data from online archives, observations, questionnaires, and FGD
   show that a flipped course leads to EFL engagement. The discussion
   reveals how EFL teacher candidates experience different levels of
   emotional, behavioral, cognitive, social, and reflective engagements in
   various modes of learning and interactions. The study elaborates on the
   positive impact of mobile-assisted flipped language learning on engaging
   teacher candidates. This study also offers some implications and
   recommendations for teaching practitioners and future research.},

Journal = {INFORMATION TECHNOLOGIES AND LEARNING TOOLS},

Abstract = {The article presents the Flipped Classroom approach and its application
   at the Faculty of Techniques and Technologies (FTT) - Yambol, based on
   the training in the subjects ``Programming and Use of Computers{''},
   ``Food Contaminants{''}, and ``Object-Oriented Programming{''} in the
   2016-2018 academic years. For the students, the problem is to filter
   some sources that are not reliable. In the new digital age, the
   lecturers expect them to be creative and to prepare their assignment
   using new approaches. When students follow their lecturers' instructions
   concerning the literature and resources their projects tend to be more
   successful. This is one of the issues we encounter in preparing students
   for their classes. The second problem that we want to solve is the
   presentation of information using the ``pouring in the bank{''}
   approach, where students are offered lectures and tutorials without
   being able actively to participate in the learning process. The students
   are trained to acquire knowledge without placing and solving problems
   and looking for new solutions. The article goals are to analyze the
   approach that we apply to the students' training to stimulate their
   activity in learning the material and filling the gaps in their
   knowledge. The first part of the article reviews the theory and the
   application of the Flipped Classroom approach by other authors in
   different subject areas. We present different taxonomic models and
   qualities that they build for the student's learning process. The
   following part analyses the application of the approach in the mentioned
   fields of study for students of Bachelor's and Master's degrees. In the
   article, we present steps for Flipped classrooms. We discuss also the
   key elements of The Flipped classroom and the benefits and limitations
   of using it. In conclusion, the article outlines the results achieved
   and the prospects for enhancing the engagement of the students in
   learning.},

Abstract = {The active learning concepts of the combined roundtable discussion and
   flipped classroom have been explored and implemented in various formats
   in K-12 and colleges and universities. Round tables include a discussion
   and debate on a specific topic. Each person is given an equal
   opportunity to participate. In a ``flipped classroom{''} the teacher
   delivers lectures before class in the form of various readings and
   activities. The teacher spends class time engaging students in learning
   activities that involve collaboration and interaction. Though the
   combined roundtable discussion and flipped classroom have become widely
   used approaches, there is still an opportunity for more research to
   analyze the perceptions of students on these approaches and to measure
   the impact of both approaches. This qualitative case study examines if
   the combined round table discussion and flipped classroom curriculum
   model impacts the student engagement of junior special education majors
   and doctoral level occupational therapist majors in a university
   setting. Rubrics, focus groups, and instructor documentation of student
   responses were used to collect data in this study. The results indicated
   that student engagement and participation were positively impacted using
   these models. The active learning strategies of discussion and peer
   instruction were important to the success of the model.},

Title = {Existing contradictions and suggestions: flipped classroom in radiology
   courses of musculoskeletal disease under Chinese medical educational
   mode from medical imaging student perspective},

Abstract = {Background Flipped classrooms have already begun to be used in many
   universities aboard, and they now make up for some of the short comings
   of the traditional classroom. We introduced the concept of flipped
   classrooms into a radiology class in China and evaluated the students'
   performance to find out whether it was a better learning method.
   Furthermore, we have attempted to identify the problems of application
   of flipped classrooms (as practiced under the Chinese education system)
   and make suggestions. Methods Facilities made videos and prepared
   clinical cases and short lectures for the flipped classroom. A total of
   55 undergraduate radiology students were asked to finish pre-class
   learning and pre-learning assessment, participate in a flipped classroom
   about bone malignant tumours, and complete questionnaires. Teachers were
   also need to finish the survey. Results
   The students showed good performances in the pre-learning assessment.
   The mean scores for three pre-learning assessment were 89.77, 96.54, and
   93.71, respectively; the median scores were 90, 97.5, and 94,
   respectively. After they attended the flipped classroom, their mastery
   of knowledge (case-solving skills, basic feature command, comparison
   ability, and overall knowledge command) showed improvements; after
   flipped classroom, the scores for these knowledge factors improved to
   81.25, 85.42, 85.42, and 85.42\%, respectively, compared to the scores
   they obtained before taking the flipped classroom (1.25, 68.75, 64.58,
   and 72.92\% respectively). The students' discussion time and
   student-teacher-communication time increased, and the students'
   questions were solved satisfactorily. CTDI-CV showed no improvement in
   critical thinking skills after taking the course. The time spent in
   previewing (pre-class video watching, material reading, and pre-learning
   assessment) increased significantly. Conclusions Flipped classrooms,
   when tested in a radiology classroom setting, show many advantages,
   making up for some inadequacies of didactic classrooms. They provide
   students with better learning experiences. We can continue to practice
   flipped classroom methods under the curriculum, but we still need to
   make improvements to make it more suitable for the Chinese medical
   education mode.},

Title = {Quasi-experimental study on the effectiveness of a flipped classroom for
   teaching adult health nursing},

Abstract = {AimThe effectiveness of flipped learning as one of the teaching methods
   of active learning has been left unexamined in nursing majors, compared
   to the frequent attempts to uncover the effectiveness of it in other
   disciplines. The purpose of this study was to reveal the effectiveness
   of flipped learning pedagogy in an adult health nursing course,
   controlling for other variables.
   MethodsThe study applied a quasi-experimental approach, comparing pre-
   and post-test results in learning outcomes. Included in this analysis
   were the records of 81 junior nursing major students. The convenience
   sampling method was used to select the participants. Those in the
   experimental group were exposed to a flipped classroom experience that
   was given after the completion of their traditional class. The students'
   learning outcomes and the level of critical thinking skills were
   evaluated before and after the intervention of the flipped classroom.
   ResultsAfter the flipped classroom experience, the scores of the
   students' achievement in subject topics and critical thinking skills,
   specifically intellectual integrity and creativity, showed a greater
   level of increase than those of their controlled counterparts. This
   remained true even after controlling for previous academic performance
   and the level of creativity.
   ConclusionThis study confirmed the effectiveness of the flipped
   classroom as a measure of active learning by applying a quantitative
   approach. But, regarding the significance of the initial contribution of
   flipped learning in the discipline of nursing science, carrying out a
   more authentic experimental study could justify the impact of flipped
   learning pedagogy.},

Abstract = {This article discusses the reasons for flipping a classroom in an
   Engineering course and for including cooperative learning, supported by
   the literature. The case study then notes the challenges in changing the
   teaching mode, for example, in building front-loaded resources, and in
   coaxing students into using them. Bloom's taxonomy enables constructive
   alignment, adding a significant third pedagogic adjustment. Evidence
   from students shows what worked and what didn't. Findings were likely to
   alert other lecturers attempting greater student engagement to what is
   entailed and to the commonality of time-expense when improving learning
   outcomes. Then student feedback on the learning experience was analysed
   to show their perspective on the changes, and to be used to fine-tune
   the course for a second cycle of action research. The results showed
   that flipped classroom helped to develop and improve students' learning
   and critical analysis skills. Furthermore, cooperative learning improved
   students' communication skills and enabled them to build their teamwork
   and problem-solving skills. More than 90\% of students agreed that
   flipped classroom with cooperative learning enabled them to extend their
   skills. Nonetheless, we show how much work is required to achieve this,
   and what pitfalls lie in the way. (C) 2018 Institution of Chemical

Abstract = {While some studies indicate that flipped classrooms offer many positive
   educational outcomes, other studies draw attention to limitations
   associated with flipped classroom (students' limited preparation prior
   to class, students' need for guidance at home, students' inability to
   get immediate feedback while they study at home, and little research has
   focused on students' learning outcomes, such as: satisfaction and
   motivation). This paper attempts to address several of these limitations
   through exploratory studies conducted in an Algerian University. The
   approach proposed in this paper called Flipped classroom based on
   Context-Aware mobile learning system (FC-CAMLS) aims to provide learners
   with an adapted course content format based on their feedback and
   context. The latter has a significant influence on multimedia content in
   adaptive mobile learning. The system was implemented in an English
   Language course. It was expected that the FC-CAMLS increased the
   management of students' heterogeneity. A quantitative analysis by means
   of structural equation modeling was performed to analyze the causal
   relationships between knowledge, skills, motivation and students'
   satisfaction. The results show that the system has positive effects on
   students' knowledge, skills, and motivation. Finally, our research
   provides useful results that the use of the context dimensions and
   learner's feedback in adaptive mobile learning is more beneficial for
   learners especially in the flipped classroom.},

Abstract = {This meta-analysis (25 articles, k = 44 independent data sources. N =
   2,323) examines the effectiveness of flipped classroom on student
   achievement in secondary education.The flipped classroom model refers to
   an instructional approach in which students watch educational videos at
   home and homework assignments are done in class. Effect sizes were
   calculated for the research designs ``post-test only',
   ``pre-test-post-test (time){''} and ``pre-test-post-test with control
   group (treatment){''}. The meta-analytical findings for the condition
   ``treatment{''} confirm the effectiveness of flipped classroom on
   student achievement in comparison to traditional instruction (Cohen's d
   = 0.42, 95\% CI {[}0.20 - 0.63], Z = 3.81, p < .001). Moderator analyses
   on the effect sizes ``time{''} show stronger effects for subjects in the
   STEM area (science, technology, engineering, mathematics) than for
   foreign languages and humanities. The effect sizes were also higher for
   shorter intervention studies than for longer ones and if quiz at home
   had been left out. Moderator analyses on the effect sizes ``post-test
   only{''} and ``treatment{''} make clear that the effect sizes for
   intervention studies without a learning management system are higher
   than with a learning management system. Findings are discussed in terms
   of their implications for educational practice.},

Abstract = {Most emergency medicine (EM) residency programs provide an orientation
   program for their incoming interns, with the lecture being the most
   common education activity during this period. Our orientation program is
   designed to bridge the gap between undergraduate and graduate medical
   education by ensuring that all learners demonstrate competency on Level
   1 Milestones, including medical knowledge (MK). To teach interns core
   medical knowledge in EM, we reformulated orientation using the
   flipped-classroom model by replacing lectures with small group,
   case-based discussions. Interns demonstrated improvement in medical
   knowledge through higher scores on a posttest. Evaluation survey results
   were also favorable for the flipped-classroom teaching format.},

Abstract = {Based on the elaboration of online learning, blended teaching and
   differences between the flipped classroom teaching and blended teaching,
   this paper addresses the fundamental principles that should be observed
   in the design of blended flipped classroom, and constructs a
   ``three-stage asynchronous{''} teaching mode of online autonomous and
   collaborative learning before class, offline presentation and
   performance in class, and online consolidation and improvement after
   class. On this basis, a mixed research method of qualitative,
   quantitative and tracking observation to verify the effectiveness of
   this teaching mode is utilized. Findings showed that it contributes to
   improving academic performances of learners, developing their autonomy,
   strengthening their consciousness of collaborative inquiry, initiating
   their enthusiasm for learning, improving their classroom engagement,
   disciplining their attendance and enhancing their self-efficacy.},

Abstract = {The adoption of the Flipped Classroom methodology is a new trend in the
   field of education, with a growing number of publications showing
   significant impacts on student behavior and performance. This
   methodology encourages the student to study the curricular content
   before attending the classroom, whereas the classroom becomes a place
   for active learning that focuses on discussions, questions and practical
   activities. In the Flipped Classroom, the student's performance is
   dependent, mainly, on activities outside the classroom conducted at a
   distance. These activities require a more active posture of the student
   in the management of their studies and, because of this requirement,
   research on Flipped Classroom points to the need to develop approaches
   that promote Self-Regulated Learning. In this sense, this study aimed to
   evaluate the usability of a Learning Analytics resource dedicated to
   Self-Regulation Learning in Flipped Classroom. The adopted method
   contemplated the convergence of multiple sources of evidence, with the
   triangulation of data collected through the SUS questionnaire and
   observation. According to the opinion of thirty-nine users who
   collaborated with the research, even with some suggestions for
   improvement, the usability of the evaluated resource is satisfactory
   and, in addition, the artifact stimulates the reflection of the student,
   offering information that favors the self-regulating processes in the
   Flipped Classrom.},

   of discipline development and social needs. From the perspective of
   reforming teaching practice, a small private online course (SPOC)-based
   flipped classroom teaching mode ofInstallation Engineering Costin Hebei
   Agricultural University based on the OBE concept was built, following
   the basic process of teaching goals-teaching activities-learning
   evaluation. These teaching activities including pre-class, in-class, and
   after-class steps had run for 2 school years on big and small class
   scales. A questionnaire survey was conducted to analyze the teaching
   effect after 2 school years of teaching practice. The results showed
   that through the SPOC-based flipped classroom teaching mode, final exam
   scores of students in the Urban and Rural Construction Institute were,
   on average, 11.11 points higher than those in the Modern Science and
   Technology Institute in 2017-2018 school year, and 8.32 points higher
   than those from traditional classroom teaching, indicating that the
   SPOC-based flipped classroom teaching on the small class scale had a
   positive effect on mastery of knowledge. Questionnaire results showed
   that students' awareness, participation, and satisfaction in flipped
   classrooms were higher than in traditional classrooms. Compared to the
   big class teaching, the implementation of small class teaching was more
   conducive to the cultivation of students' comprehensive abilities. The
   SPOC-based flipped classroom teaching mode provides a reference for
   blended teaching in the future.},

Journal = {RESEARCH IN LEARNING TECHNOLOGY},

Volume = {28},
Abstract = {A flipped classroom lecture approach was utilised in an engineering
   mathematics course (118 students). This article reports on student
   viewing habits based on 104 videos over a period of 12 weeks. The video
   statistics indicate that many students waited until the last day before
   assignments to watch the required videos. There are also indications
   that the students would try to reduce the heavy workload induced by
   watching all videos on a single day by skipping videos perceived as less
   valuable. The data show a strong negative correlation between the length
   of a video and how much of that video the students watched per viewing
   setting. However, although students watched less of longer videos, the
   data also indicate that the students still watched, to a large degree,
   every part of the videos, just not in a single viewing session. Based on
   these results, recommendations on video creation and flipped classroom
   implementation are given.},

Title = {Comparing the effects of traditional lecture and flipped classroom on
   nursing students' critical thinking disposition: A quasi-experimental
   study},
Journal = {NURSE EDUCATION TODAY},
Year = {2018},
Volume = {71},

Abstract = {Background: One of the most principal key aims of nursing education is
   to promote nursing students' and nurses' critical thinking. Therefore,
   nursing education needs to develop an appropriate curriculum and use
   effective instructional strategies for critical thinking promotion.
   Flipped classroom is a teaching method which substitutes individual
   learning for group learning in a dynamic, interactive environment where
   the teacher guides students to understand and use concepts.
   Objectives: The present study aimed to compare the effects of
   traditional lecture and flipped classroom on Iranian nursing students'
   critical thinking disposition.
   Methods: This nonequivalent control group pretest-posttest
   quasi-experimental study was done in 2016 on 85 second-year bachelor's
   nursing students who had signed up for the Musculoskeletal
   Medical-Surgical Nursing theoretical training course. Because of their
   large number, students had been divided at the beginning of the first
   semester of their four-year program into two 42- and 43-student groups
   and attended separate theoretical training classes. These two classes
   were randomly allocated to either a traditional lecture or a flipped
   classroom group. The instructional strategies in these groups were the
   traditional lecture and the flipped class strategies, respectively. A
   demographic questionnaire and Ricketts' Critical Thinking Disposition
   Inventory were used for data collection.
   Results: After the intervention, the mean scores of critical thinking
   disposition and its engagement domain in the flipped class group were
   significantly higher than the traditional lecture group (P < 0.0001).
   Conclusions: This study shows the positive effects of flipped classroom
   on nursing students' critical thinking disposition. It is recommended
   that future studies assess the effects of flipped classroom on other
   nursing education outcomes.},

Abstract = {The purpose of this study is to explain how performances are used within
   a flipped classroom environment in a university educational psychology
   class. This instructional approach also incorporates the concept of
   ``integrated assessment{''} where assessment and instruction are
   intimately connected. Examples of student-led instruction using
   performances are provided. Results of a teacher-developed assessment
   administered during the past several years to elicit student evaluations
   of these instructional practices have provided evidence that using this
   instructional approach is effective for most but not all students.},

Title = {A quantitative analysis of the short-term and mid-term benefit of a
   flipped classroom for foundational engineering dynamics},
Journal = {RESEARCH PAPERS IN EDUCATION},
Abstract = {The flipped classroom is an emerging strategy for the delivery of
   technical threshold content within tertiary engineering programs. In
   this study, we measure the effect that the approach has on the immediate
   and ongoing academic success of four cohorts of engineering dynamics
   students in New Zealand. Two cohorts (N = 865) received traditional
   lectures and two cohorts (N = 123) received a flipped classroom
   delivery. Both the Wilcoxon ranksum and the Kolmogorov-Smirnov tests
   noted a lack of significant contrasts across the performance in the
   first year dynamics class due to the teaching approach used (p > 0.05).
   In a follow-on dynamics class, N = 303 students previously undertook
   traditional lectures and N = 35 previously undertook flipped classrooms.
   When follow-on marks were compared across groups, there were no
   statistically significant differences observed across those that took
   the foundational class via traditional or flipped teaching approaches.
   This outcome implies that the flipped approach has a negligible effect
   on student academic achievement. However, these outcomes must be
   considered in context of the qualitative benefits of the flipped
   classroom approach.},

Abstract = {The flipped classroom continues to garner increasing interest in nursing
   education; however, few research studies fully document faculty
   experiences with its implementation. This study's purpose was to explore
   undergraduate nurse educators' transition from traditional
   teacher-centered, content-driven strategies to the flipped classroom and
   describe perceived successes and challenges during the process. A
   qualitative approach using interpretive description gave voice to a
   purposive sample of sixteen undergraduate nurse educators across the
   United States and Canada. Semistructured interviews, audio-recorded and
   transcribed verbatim, yielded a set of experiential themes. Participants
   revealed marked challenges as they rethought classroom design in
   relation to evidence-based educational principles, and met a surprising
   level of resistance from students and faculty colleagues. Still, faculty
   observations reflected increased student problem solving,
   self-determination and a greater correlation between teacher-made and
   standardized test scores. Participants advocated continued integration
   of flipped classrooms into nursing curricula and recommended greater
   collegial and administrative support from academic environments.},

Abstract = {With the arrival of new technologies to the educational world, the
   Flipped Classroom is a methodology that is gaining more and more
   importance in primary education classrooms. In this sense, the main
   objective of this study was been to determine the effects of this
   methodology on the social climate of the classroom. For this purpose,
   852 students (Age = 10.82, SD = .867), divided into a control group (437
   students) and an experimental group (415 students), took part in the
   study. This latter group took part in a Flipped Classroom intervention
   lasting two terms. Both groups completed a survey on perceived social
   climate (Villa, 1992) at the beginning and at the end of the
   intervention. The results showed that the experimental group did not
   present significant differences with respect to the control group in any
   of the analysed dimensions, with the exception of the case of the
   interpersonal context. Here, the decrease in scores in the experimental
   group was milder than in the control group. These findings support the
   idea that the Flipped Classroom methodology by itself does not help to
   significantly improve the social climate of the classroom. In view of
   these results, possible reasons are discussed and future research topics
   are presented.},

Abstract = {Nowadays, there are quite a few experiences of the use of the flipped
   classroom (FC) in engineering education due to their advantages in
   comparison with the traditional methodology. The possibility of
   promoting students' active learning under the FC can lead to
   improvements in the learning outcomes. Nonetheless, there are several
   issues that arise when using the FC (such as the students' need of
   preparing the face-to-face lesson) that must be addressed. To take
   advantage of the whole potential of the FC, we propose the application
   of learning analytics (LA) to improve the FC. In particular, we define a
   methodology that proposes a set of recommended actions to be done to
   enhance a specific type of flipped classroom through LA. Moreover, we
   present a LA tool designed and implemented specifically for this
   methodology. This tool allows teachers to obtain relevant information
   needed to improve their FC experiences. The information is provided
   using several visualizations that are analyzed and explained in detail.
   We illustrate the use of the tool with students from engineering
   courses.},

Title = {Exploring Student Motivation and Performance in the Flipped Classroom: A
   Case Study of Nursing Students},
Journal = {ELECTRONIC JOURNAL OF GENERAL MEDICINE},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {19},
Number = {3},
Month = {JUN},
Abstract = {Introduction \& Background: Technological progress has transformed all
   areas including the field of education and training. This has allowed us
   to take advantage of the functionalities offered by information and
   communication technologies to improve learning experiences. This
   research aims to explore the motivation and performance of nursing
   students in the flipped classroom compared to the traditional method.
   Methods: This pre-experimental study was conducted on a single group
   pretest-posttest with twenty students using two distinct teaching
   methods (the traditional method and the flipped classroom) in the
   community health planning course. In pre-test and post-test, motivation
   and performance scores were calculated, respectively, from the motivated
   strategies for learning questionnaire and the results of the performance
   tests. Pretest and posttest scores were compared using the Wilcoxon
   signed-rank test.
   Results: The findings showed that the motivation scores of all students
   (n=20) were positively improved in the flipped classroom compared to the
   traditional method. Specifically, extrinsic goal orientation (p=0.021),
   control beliefs (p=0.019), and self-efficacy for learning and
   performance (p=0.016) were the motivational subcomponents that were
   significantly improved. However, intrinsic goal orientation (p=0.055),
   task value (p=0.866), and test anxiety (p=0.6) did not show a
   statistically significant. On the other hand, student performance was
   significantly improved in the flipped classroom (14.4 +/- 2.57 vs. 17.7
   +/- 1.28, p<0.001).
   Conclusion: This innovative approach is an essential alternative for
   improving the quality of nursing education.},

Abstract = {Medical statistics is one of the most important courses for medical
   students. It requires tremendous practice opportunities to fully master
   the learning contents. The in-class lectures inevitably reduce students'
   practice opportunities and the possibility of getting timely feedbacks.
   More importantly, a passive learning experience made by traditional
   class may eliminate any sense of autonomy or competence in learners.
   Thus, the present study attempted to redesign medical statistics course
   in a Chinese medical school by using the flipped classroom approach and
   examined the effectiveness of this approach on learning interest,
   self-regulated learning ability, and academic performance. The results
   showed both learning interest and academic performance experienced
   significant increase within the traditional class and flipped class;
   however, the changes in the flipped class were significantly larger than
   the traditional class. As for self-regulated learning, it significantly
   increased only within the flipped class, no significant change was found
   within the traditional class. The change of self-regulated learning in
   the flipped class was not significantly different from the traditional
   class. In general, the effectiveness of flipped classroom approach for
   medical statistics was verified. Further studies should examine whether
   the flipped classroom approach for medical statistics is benefit to
   self-regulated learning or metacognition.},

Abstract = {Learning to write computer programs and engaging students in
   introductory programming subjects are difficult tasks. This study
   presents the results obtained when using flipped classroom and peer
   instruction methodologies in an introductory course of programming.
   Before the lecture, out-of-class study and on-line homework
   questionnaires were applied, and peer instruction was used in the
   classroom to encourage students' participation and discussion, assisted
   by an on-the-fly assessment app. The main academic results, the degree
   of involvement in the course activities, and the students' feedback were
   collected and compared with similar data from previous academic years.
   Significantly better pass (chi(2) = 12.94, p < .001) and dropout rates
   (chi(2) = 7.08, p < .01) were obtained when using flipped classroom and
   peer instruction. Laboratory attendance also improved significantly
   (chi(2) = 27.62, p < .001). Our results showed significant positive
   correlations between the work performed at home and the grade obtained
   in the final exam (rho = 0.51, p < .001). According to the students'
   opinions, class preparation at home increased significantly (chi(2) =
   46.59, p < .001) by 33\% due to the new methodologies used. These
   results, based on a sample of six offerings of the same programming
   course, suggest that the application of flipped classroom and peer
   instruction improves the quality of the autonomous work of the students
   as well as their involvement in the lectures, and therefore, their
   knowledge acquisition improves.},

Title = {Learning outcomes of a flipped classroom teaching approach in an
   adult-health nursing course: a quasi-experimental study},
Journal = {BMC MEDICAL EDUCATION},

Abstract = {Background New teaching strategies must be developed not only to enhance
   nurse's competence but also to allow nurses to respond to the complex
   health care needs of today's society. The purpose of this study was to
   explore the learning outcomes of a flipped classroom teaching approach
   in an adult-health nursing course for students in a two-year Bachelor of
   Science in Nursing program. Methods The study had a quasi-experimental
   design. An 18-week flipped classroom teaching approach was applied in an
   adult-health nursing course. In total, 485 nursing students enrolled in
   the study, with 287 in the experimental group and 198 in the control
   group. The Self-Evaluated Core Competencies Scale, Metacognitive
   Inventory for Nursing Students, Self-Directed Learning Readiness Scale,
   and self-designed learning satisfaction questionnaire were used to
   evaluate the students' learning outcomes. Results The experimental group
   showed a statistically significant increase in the overall scores for
   self-evaluated core competencies, the ``self-modification{''} subscale
   of the Metacognitive Inventory for Nursing Students, and in overall
   self-directed learning readiness; further, they also showed high levels
   of course satisfaction. Conclusions A flipped classroom teaching
   approach had a positive impact on student's learning motivation and
   contributed to better learning outcomes in an adult-health nursing
   course. The flipped classroom combined with hybrid teaching methods is a
   suitable and effective learning strategy for a registered nurse (RN) to
   Bachelor of Science in Nursing (BSN) program to tackle today's complex
   revolution in nursing curricula, and may enhance nursing students'
   abilities to address numerous challenges.},

Abstract = {Preparing residents for the on-call experience in Radiology is one of
   the most important aspects of education within a training program.
   Traditionally, this preparation has occurred via a combination of case
   conferences and didactic lectures by program faculty, daily teaching at
   the workstation, and precall assessments. Recently, a blended curricular
   model referred to as the flipped classroom has generated a lot of
   attention within the realm of graduate medical education. We applied
   this technique to resident precall education in the subspecialty of
   Neuroradiology, and surveyed the participants about their perceptions of
   the course. The structure, implementation, and web-based platform used
   to create the flipped classroom experience is described herein.

Abstract = {This research analyses the effectiveness of the flipped classroom
   pedagogical model on the performance and satisfaction of future teachers
   studying towards a master's degree in teacher training in a completely
   online environment. It uses a quantitative methodology with a
   quasi-experimental design and a non-equivalent control group. The
   control group comprises 103 students and the experimental group 119. The
   academic performance of both groups before and after the intervention is
   compared through a knowledge questionnaire and evaluation of the results
   of their learning throughout the semester. In addition, it considers
   their opinions on the experience through a satisfaction questionnaire at
   the end of the course. Although both groups display equivalent levels of
   knowledge at the pretest stage, we found differences upon completion of
   the intervention, where the experimental group achieved higher levels,
   with a medium effect size (r = 0.66). The activities used to evaluate
   the results of the learning show the existence of statistically
   significant differences, with higher mid-ranges in the experimental
   group in all activities, with a very large effect size in three of them
   (r = 0.89, r = 0.90, and r = 0.96) and large in another (r = 0.68). In
   relation to the students' degree of satisfaction with the process that
   was implemented, all of the dimensions analysed have scores above 3.56
   (on a scale of 1 to 4). We observed a highly positive effect after
   implementing the flipped classroom model with improved student learning,
   both in performance and in motivation, commitment, and interaction
   between students and teacher. We conclude that there is a need to
   incorporate the flipped classroom model in the initial training of
   teaching staff.},

Abstract = {Some of the new teaching models that have emerged, including the Flipped
   Classroom, can be key to reversing traditional educational practices.
   However, it is necessary to analyse in detail how these educational
   experiences are being implemented in the classroom, and how this is
   affecting students' learning. The present research uses a case study
   methodology. The objective is to analyse a higher education course
   taught using flipped classroom methodology and to assess the impact of
   the implementation of said pedagogical model on the students' formative
   process. The study used a data collection instrument based on a
   structured interview and a data analysis strategy based on the Grounded
   Theory. In general, the results show that students tend to express
   positive opinions and a good degree of satisfaction with their
   experiences with this pedagogical method. Most students confirm that the
   method successfully stimulates cooperative learning and favours the
   practical acquisition of knowledge, stimulating in turn the development
   of a series of key competences in the educational process, along with
   capabilities such as organisation, autonomy and responsibility, among
   others.},

Title = {Effects of online flipped classroom on foreign language classroom
   anxiety and reading anxiety},
Journal = {COMPUTER ASSISTED LANGUAGE LEARNING},
Abstract = {In this study, we aimed to integrate the flipped classroom model into
   ``Advanced Reading and Writing{''} course and to investigate the effect
   of the flipped classroom model on pre-service English language teachers'
   foreign language classroom anxiety (FLCA) and foreign language reading
   anxieties (FLRA). This study involved two groups (34 in the flipped
   group and 32 in the non-flipped group) of first-year English language
   teachers in Turkey. Within this framework, Foreign Language Classroom
   Anxiety Scale and Foreign Language Reading Anxiety Scale were employed
   to determine pre-service English language teachers' FLCA and FLRA levels
   before and after the treatment in the flipped and the non-flipped groups
   comparatively. There was a significant decrease in the FLCA and FLRA
   levels in the flipped group. However, there was no significant change in
   the non-flipped group. Supplemental data for this article is available

Abstract = {Higher education enrollment has declined recently. New recruiting
   strategies and student-centered learning environments with challenge,
   enthusiasm, and joy are required to boost enrollment and engagement.
   Thus, the student-centered teaching approach, which one of the
   approaches under implementation and observation, are increasingly
   needed. Gamification and flipped classroom are cutting-edge educational
   approaches to motivate students. Nevertheless, the effectiveness of both
   methods has not yet been explored. The aim of this experimental study is
   thus to investigate and compare the effectiveness of these approaches.
   Student-led activities are designed and the perspectives from both
   participants and activity conductors are collected. The results show
   that these techniques successfully shift students' perceived usefulness
   and engagement intention. Gamification gains slightly better results
   than flipped classroom from the participants' viewpoints.},

Title = {STUDENTS' CONCEPTUAL UNDERSTANDING AND SCIENCE PROCESS SKILLS IN AN
   INQUIRY-BASED FLIPPED CLASSROOM ENVIRONMENT},

Abstract = {Purpose: The purpose of this study is to determine the impact of an
   Inquiry-based Flipped classroom model on the conceptual understanding
   and science process skills of junior high school students in the
   Philippines.
   Method: A two-group pretest/post-test design was conducted on 55 Grade 9
   students for the study. One group received instruction using the flipped
   classroom format while the other group serving as control was taught in
   the conventional format. A Conceptual Understanding Test (CUT) and a
   Science Process Skills Test (SPST) were used to measure the impact of
   instruction on the two groups. Independent samples t-test was used to
   determine if there was a significant difference between the groups while
   paired samples t-test was conducted on both groups to determine if the
   groups improved significantly after a 7-week intervention. Linear
   regression was performed to determine if science process skills was a
   positive predictor of conceptual understanding.
   Findings: Inquiry-based flipped classroom did not make students perform
   better than the non-flipped inquiry-based learning environment in the
   Conceptual Understanding Test (CUT) and Science Process Skills Test
   (SPST) except on one biology topic (non-Mendelian Genetics) where the
   Hipped Inquiry Group scored significantly higher than the control in the
   CUT Students' science process skills positively predicted their
   conceptual understanding in biology.
   Significance: Inquiry-based flipped classroom can be as effective as the
   non-flipped inquiry-based instruction in improving students' conceptual
   understanding and science process skills but can be made even more
   effective depending on the content, the manner the content is uploaded
   and the choice of LMS for uploading the online content. The study also
   showed the importance of science process skills in enhancing students'
   conceptual understanding in biology.},

Abstract = {The flipped classroom, with its focus on student-centered learning and
   active student engagement, is a growing trend in social work education.
   This article presents an innovative way of delivering practice content
   through the flipped classroom model, which can be adapted for any level
   of social work education. It walks readers through the steps of
   developing the course and the successes and challenges of the flip,
   particularly with an incorporated skills lab component. Additionally,
   this article shares student reflections on the development and execution
   of the course, with specific feedback on the experiential learning
   environment, discussions surrounding instructor workload and
   preparation, and implications for future iterations of the course from
   students who had very little prior technologically centered learning
   experiences.},

Title = {Flipped Classroom in Teacher Education: A Scoping Review},
Journal = {FRONTIERS IN EDUCATION},
Year = {2020},
Volume = {5},
Month = {NOV 12},
Abstract = {Although flipped classroom (FC) has been popular in education since the
   2000s, there is a lack of reviews on how the teaching approach has been
   applied and what has been gained in the field of teacher education. Most
   reviews focus either on implementation and learning outcomes with
   students in higher education and disciplines other than education or on
   the latter approaches with primary and secondary school pupils. This
   article presents a scoping literature review of 33 studies published
   between 2014 until 2019 on flipped classroom (FC) in teacher education.
   Our analysis points out that studies were mainly conducted in the United
   States, with an increased implementation in European and Asian
   countries, and with adoption primarily in the disciplines pedagogy,
   science, and language arts. Moreover, a majority of studies employed
   mixed methods with surveys being the most commonly used instrument to
   collect data. Two main foci were identified across the reviewed studies:
   student perceptions and academic performance. The analysis of the former
   revealed six outcomes (1. Attitude, motivation, and emotion; 2. Content
   delivery; 3. Learning environment; 4. Learning experience; 5. Instructor
   and student presence; 6. Engagement). Based on our synthesis, we discuss
   current trends and future development in the research field, FC's
   pedagogical value added in teacher education, and potential knowledge
   gaps in the research literature.},

Title = {The utility of a flipped classroom in secondary Mathematics education},
Journal = {INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF MATHEMATICAL EDUCATION IN SCIENCE AND
   TECHNOLOGY},
Abstract = {Flipped classrooms serve as a new pedagogical approach for teaching and
   learning, which involves switching from the traditional teacher-centred
   academic agenda. Unlike the traditional classroom model, the flipped
   classroom enables students to understand the lesson better while
   learning at their own pace and enhancing their communication skills
   among peers. At the same time, lecturers are provided with an
   opportunity to extend the discussion time in class through a more
   interactive session between students. While research works regarding the
   success of implementing flipped classrooms have been widely undertaken
   in the literature, only a few of these works considered exposing such
   models to secondary students. Engaging secondary students in the flipped
   classroom and investigating its impact on students paves the way for
   preparing an academic environment for students' advanced courses in the
   future. In this work, a case study was conducted at Barstow High School
   (Barstow, California) to evaluate the implementation of flipped
   classrooms in Mathematics education from an interplay of factors such as
   gender, ethnicity, and students' attitude. The students showed positive
   usability of the model from the end-activity evaluation and further
   noted an improved communication channel inside the classroom, allowing
   them to pace their own learning.},

Title = {The effects of the flipped classroom in teaching evidence based nursing:
   A quasi-experimental study},
Journal = {PLOS ONE},

Abstract = {Background
   Evidence-based nursing (EBN) has been an important training mechanism
   for improving the quality of clinical care. At present, the pedagogy
   focuses on the application of e-learning and team-based learning to
   enhance learners' engagement and learning effectiveness.
   Objectives
   This study applied the flipped classroom approach to conduct
   evidence-based nursing (EBN) teaching. The aim of this study is to
   elevate the learning effectiveness of the flipped classroom group to the
   traditional teaching group in terms of knowledge and self-efficacy in
   practice.
   Design
   A pretest-posttest nonequivalent control group with a quasi-experimental
   quantitative design.
   Methods
   The study recruited 151 nurses, of whom 75 were in the control group and
   76 were in the experimental group. During the EBN course, the control
   group received training via traditional pedagogy while the experimental
   group engaged the flipped classroom approach. The learning effectiveness
   of EBN knowledge and self-efficacy in practice were evaluated across the
   three time points: pre-course, post-course, and one month after the
   course.
   Results
   In both group the scores of the EBN knowledge and self-efficacy in
   practice improved after training. The scores of the experimental group
   increased significantly than in the control group. However, the scores
   declined in both groups one month after the course. Even so, the
   experimental group's score of self-efficacy in practice was still higher
   than that of the control group.
   Conclusion
   The implementation of the flipped classroom approach and team-based
   learning effectively enhanced the learners EBN knowledge accumulation
   and self-efficacy in practice. The research results can be used as an
   important reference for improving clinical nursing teaching quality.},

Abstract = {This study aims to analyze the practical application of the flipped
   classroom or reverse class in various groups of the 5th year of Primary
   Education in order to check what differences exist between the
   implementation of a traditional teaching model and an active teaching
   model in the classroom. For this, a discussion group was held among the
   teachers in order to collect information on the characteristics of the
   students and the operation of each group. This allowed two of the three
   participating groups to implement this methodology, one of them being
   considered the control group. The design of the teaching unit required
   the creation of a web portal with information and videos on the content
   addressed, in this case, related to the practice of handball.The
   evaluation results show a higher performance in the groups in which the
   flipped classroom has been implemented compared to the group that does
   not apply it. Furthermore, high participation in the reverse class
   favors the development of new motor skills and an improvement in social
   competence. From these results, it is concluded that the application of
   the flipped classroom favors the strengthening of the ties between
   teacher-student, as well as an approach of families towards the study of
   their children, promoting cooperation and collaboration between families
   and the educational center. Likewise, motor and social competence have
   improved, in addition to the involvement and motivation of the students,
   making the student an active agent of their learning.},

Title = {Artificial Intelligence-Based Simulation Research on the Flipped
   Classroom Mode of Listening and Speaking Teaching for English Majors},
Journal = {MOBILE INFORMATION SYSTEMS},
Year = {2021},
Volume = {2021},
Month = {OCT 27},
Abstract = {Information technology has become an important carrier for the
   implementation of flipped classrooms, giving full play to the role of
   modern education technology and transforming the traditional classroom
   teaching form into an important form in today's education reform. This
   article mainly studies the simulation of the flipped classroom model of
   listening and speaking teaching for English majors based on artificial
   intelligence. A total of 31 English majors were selected for the
   experiment, including 7 boys and 24 girls. After obtaining the consent
   of school leaders and teachers, 16 weeks of experimental teaching were
   carried out in the class. The experimental subjects had not been exposed
   to the flipped classroom teaching mode before the start of the
   experiment, and they were willing to participate in this experiment.
   After the phased flipped classroom teaching mode was carried out in the
   experimental class, the teaching objects in the experimental class were
   selected in the form of interview questionnaires to understand students'
   attitudes and acceptance of the flipped classroom teaching mode in
   English listening and speaking classes. Adjust and improve the poststage
   flipped classroom teaching model to provide reference. During the
   experiment, the control class adopted the multimedia courseware-assisted
   oral teaching method and, in the experimental class, flipped the
   classroom oral teaching mode. Teachers integrate resources when
   preparing lessons to design flip-flop classroom oral English teaching,
   and teachers guide students to use the internet to search for resources
   and preview independently. The average value of the English
   self-management learning ability of the students of this major was 27.48
   points before the experiment started. After passing the experiment, the
   score increased to 38.90 points, and the average value increased
   significantly (t = -20.189, P<0.01). A comparatively complete comparison
   of English listening and speaking teaching results was carried out.
   Before the implementation of the flipped classroom, the students'
   average professional English score was 76.23 points, and the average
   score after the launch was 84.39 points. The overall average score
   increased by 8.16 points. With regard to students' English learning
   scores, there has been some improvement. The results show that, through
   the implementation of flipped classrooms, students have exercised their
   ability to self-manage their learning and strengthened their ability to
   make learning plans, implement them, and reflect on the effectiveness of
   learning.},

Title = {Developing Sound Knowledge of Basic Science Concepts in Children Using
   Flipped Classroom: A case of simple repeated measures},
Journal = {EDUCATION AND INFORMATION TECHNOLOGIES},
Abstract = {Due to the advent of coronavirus disease in most nations throughout the
   world, the manner of education altered from traditional face-to-face to
   remote or online teaching. As a result, the new normal necessitates the
   adoption of an online teaching and learning platform for all levels of
   education. The study tested the effectiveness of a flipped classroom
   instructional technique on children's development of sound knowledge of
   Basic Science concepts. Thirty-one primary three children took part in
   the treatment session, which was conducted using a simple repeated
   measures design. The study collected data using the Basic Science
   Achievement Test (BSAT), which was adequately validated and
   trial-tested. The children were given two distinct pretests before the
   treatment and two different posttests afterward. The data were analyzed
   using a mixed-design repeated-measures analysis of variance. The
   findings demonstrated that using a flipped classroom instructional
   technique boosted children's development of a good understanding of
   Basic Science significantly (p = 000) with an effect size of 0.953. The
   implementation of a flipped classroom instructional technique in
   teaching and learning Basic Science was advocated as a result of these
   results.},

Title = {Utilising database-driven interactive software to enhance independent

   engineering concepts to ensuring formative assessment},
Journal = {EUROPEAN JOURNAL OF ENGINEERING EDUCATION},

Abstract = {The concept of formative assessment is considered by many to play an
   important role in enhancing teaching in higher engineering education. In
   this paper, the concept of the flipped classroom as part of a blended
   learning curriculum is highlighted as an ideal medium through which
   formative assessment practices arise. Whilst the advantages of greater
   interaction between students and lecturers in classes are numerous,
   there are often clear disadvantages associated with the independent
   home-study component that complements timetabled sessions in a flipped
   classroom setting, specifically, the popular method of replacing
   traditional classroom teaching with video lectures. This leads to a
   clear lack of assurances that the cited benefits of a flipped classroom
   approach are echoed in the home-study arena. Over the past three years,
   the authors have sought to address identified deficiencies in this area
   of blended learning through the development of database-driven
   e-learning software with the capability of introducing formative
   assessment practices to independent home-study. This paper maps out
   aspects of two specific evolving practices at separate institutions,
   from which guiding principles of incorporating formative assessment
   aspects into e-learning software are identified and highlighted in the
   context of independent home-study as part of a flipped classroom
   approach.},

Abstract = {A more effective math education has never been more pressing than in
   today's world. However, it is no mystery that students continue to
   struggle with basic mathematics concepts, let alone more advanced math
   such as Pre-Calculus. Thus, in the present study, two Pre-Calculus math
   classrooms were randomly assigned to either a flipped classroom model of
   instruction or one that employed traditional lecture. Data on two
   aspects of Pre-Calculus-matrices and vectors (operations and
   application)-were collected at pretest and again at posttest. Results
   revealed that students who were exposed to the flipped classroom model
   outperformed students in the control classroom but only on matrices
   items. We discuss implications and recommendations for math education.},

Abstract = {The aim of this study is twofold. First, it aims to investigate the
   impact of the Flipped Classroom (FC) Model on students' academic
   achievement. Second, it reveals the students' opinions about the model
   itself. For four weeks, the students in the experimental group were
   taught in a blended learning context where the FC Model was applied,
   while the lessons in the control group were carried out through
   traditional blended learning. Both groups were administered a test
   before and after the Flipped Classroom sessions. To analyze the data, a
   two-way ANOVA for Mixed Measures was conducted to compare the means of
   test scores of each group. The results showed that there were no
   statistically significant differences between the scores of the two
   groups. Coming to classes prepared and completing the assignments in
   class, so that students did not need to do assignments at home, were
   among the positive aspects of the FC Model. The problems encountered in
   this model, however, are categorized under three main titles:
   Motivation, Content, and Learning. At the end of the study, the
   advantages and disadvantages of the FC Model are identified in
   accordance with the participants' opinions, and necessary suggestions
   made.},

Abstract = {This study provided a novel flipped classroom model with a detailed
   combination of in-class and out-of-class activities to teach a
   Vietnamese-English Translation module. The study aimed to (1) provide an
   in-depth insight into how the model was actually implemented in a
   specific scenario to make the teaching-learning process more interesting
   and meaningful, and (2) investigate the effectiveness of the flipped
   classroom model towards learners' translation performance through
   various assessments. 39 English-majored juniors at Banking University of
   Ho Chi Minh City, Vietnam participated in the study during the second
   semester of the 2018-2019 academic year. The study implemented a
   case-study mixed method design, applying assessment analysis and content
   analysis of one specific learning scenario to clarify how the flipped
   learning model contributed to the training process. Results show that a
   careful design of the flipped model contributed to the relevant
   literature on how to implement flipped learning in actual classroom
   settings, but also effectively improved learners' performance in
   translation studies.},

Abstract = {The present article is aimed at analyzing the effects of learning
   analytics on students' self-regulated learning in a flipped classroom.
   An experiment was conducted with 96 engineering students, enrolled in a
   subject offered in the Flipped Classroom model. The students were
   divided into two groups: an experimental group (N = 51) and a control
   group (N = 45). After each learning unit, while the control group did
   not have access to any learning analytics resources, students from the
   experimental group received a bulletin with feedback to support
   Self-Regulated Learning. The levels of student self-regulation were
   measured through questionnaires at the beginning and the end of the
   course. The analysis of the collected data revealed that the bulletin
   promoted significant effects in self-regulated learning in the
   experimental group, stimulating the self-reflection and colleague's
   support search for clarifying doubts. These results demonstrate that
   learning analytics can be used to promote self-regulated learning in
   flipped classrooms, helping students identify strategies that can
   increase their academic performance.},

Abstract = {Flipped classroom is an approach that has been increasingly used in K-12
   and higher education. Many studies on the flipped classroom have focused
   on student behaviors, with inadequate attention to student thinking,
   which is crucial to learning. Meanwhile, prior studies have examined the
   effects of visualization tools, such as concept map, on improving
   student learning through in-depth thinking. Another related approach is
   knowledge graph, which presents a set of entities and their
   relationships in a graph as well as in a machine language for further
   processing and reasoning. It has a potential to support collaborative
   knowledge construction by automatic combination of individual knowledge
   graphs. To compare the effects of knowledge graph and concept map on
   student learning in a flipped classroom, we conducted an experimental
   study in fifth grade class at an elementary school. Students in the
   experimental group used a knowledge graph tool in the Learning Cell
   System, while those in the control group used a concept map tool, XMind,
   to support their learning of ancient Chinese poetry. The results showed
   that learning with knowledge graph resulted in better performance in the
   breadth and depth of subject knowledge as reflected in the students'
   learning products (ie, concept maps or knowledge graphs).},

Abstract = {The flipped classroom model has created a great interest in primary
   education as it is based on a student-centered approach and the
   promotion of active and meaningful learning. In addition, this model
   allows teachers to more effectively involve primary pupils in their
   learning experience by developing their scientific and technological
   knowledge and skills. On this basis, this study examines the results
   obtained in the subject of Social Science by sixth-grade pupils in the
   school year 2018-19 once the model was applied. For this aim, a new
   digital platform is used for online activities with an educational
   approach based on the promotion of reflective practice and active
   learning. After experiencing most of that school year with this online
   platform, the results of the students were, on average, much more
   positive following the flipped classroom approach. In particular, there
   has been a significant improvement in academic performance along with a
   positive evaluation of the model developed in this area. Given the
   positive results, this study recommends more research on this model to
   expand its knowledge in all disciplines of this educational stage.},

Title = {IMPLEMENTING THE FLIPPED CLASSROOM: A CASE STUDY OF TEACHING ESP TO THE
   BACHELORS IN AUTOMATION AND COMPUTER-INTEGRATED TECHNOLOGIES},

Abstract = {The paper describes the experience of flipped classroom application in
   teaching ESP. The study was held at the National Aviation University and
   involved 46 undergraduate students majoring in ``Automation and
   Computer-Integrated Technologies{''}. In-class learning was organized
   according to the university schedule and out-of-class activities were
   conducted by using Google Classroom and a set of digital learning tools.
   Our observations during teaching with their further analysis and a
   designed questionnaire were used to reveal the benefits and drawbacks of
   the flipped classroom. The analysis of the students' responses has shown
   that it allows students to study at their own pace, meet their needs,
   develop their organizational, communication and time management skills
   and increase their independence and creativity. The paper specifies
   three main phases of the flipped classroom and determines what skills
   are developed at each of them. Remembering and understanding are
   developed at the first phase and the freed classroom time is devoted to
   developing the skills of applying and analyzing. The higher-order
   thinking skills of evaluating and creating can be formed both in the
   classroom and during the post-class phase. The authors have selected
   digital learning tools which can be recommended for learning ESP in
   order to facilitate students' out-of-class activities. Their use can
   help to shift the emphasis from the teacher to the student, increase
   students' engagement in learning and make the course versatile and
   appropriate to students' needs. A student survey was conducted at the
   end of the academic year, and the analysis of students' responses
   revealed that they had a positive attitude to implementing the flipped
   classroom in teaching ESP. As shown by the results of the study, the use
   of the flipped classroom for teaching ESP is effective as it saves much
   in-class time for communicative tasks enhancing the development of
   higher-order thinking skills, unites in-class and out-of-class learning,
   controls students' achievement not only in the classroom but outside it
   and makes the learning process more engaging.},

Abstract = {Purpose - This paper aims to examine the impact of the learning
   management system (LMS), in promoting students' self-directed
   experiential learning using the flipped classroom approach. This study
   further evaluates the effectiveness of integrating video lectures,
   perceived as a social interface, for students to watch, prior to their
   class session conducted in class.
   Design/methodology/approach - This is a case study that investigated a
   group of undergraduate students of English as a foreign language (EFL)
   to identify the impact of the LMS TES BlendSpace in fostering their
   self-directed learning capacity, using a flipped classroom approach.
   Data were gathered through a qualitative approach from student
   interviews and observations of student activities and video-recordings
   uploaded on TES BlendSpace.
   Findings - Flipped classrooms have begun to redesign learning spaces and
   promote active learning through video-enabled instructional practices.
   This study provides an overview of flipped classrooms and the benefits
   students' gain from the wealth of online content posted on the LMS. The
   flipped classroom model has clearly shifted the learning paradigm,
   enabling students the autonomy of their self-directed learning pace and
   to become acquainted with the currency of video lectures that promote
   efficacious learning. This study concludes with implications for further
   research in this area.
   Originality/value - This study has the potential to contribute towards
   the advancement of students' self-directed learning and proposes its
   continued application for future EFL classes in this institution, as
   well as across all courses, to enable self-direction for all students.},

Abstract = {This article introduces the results of an experimental intercultural
   English class (IEC) using the flipped classroom methodology. Thematic
   units were developed with the 5 E's instructional model (Engage,
   Explore, Explain, Elaborate, and Evaluate) based on the constructivist
   approach to learning. A mixed-method research approach collected data
   from 20 students at Atlantico University. The questionnaires used in the
   analysis of the 2 survey rounds rate Students' responses in relation to
   learning of contents, methodology of the class and autonomy. Results
   based on the second round led to four major conclusions: (i). There is
   satisfaction with the use of the Flipped Classroom strategy, in terms of
   time management and freedom to prepare classes. (ii). Practical
   activities are more engaging to work collaboratively. (iii). Teachers
   have a subtle presence which provides more opportunities for students to
   negotiate control and participation. (iv) Although autonomous learning
   is possible, teacher support is pivotal to increasing it. These findings
   are discussed within the framework of the didactical component of
   teaching and its implications for this public university.},

Abstract = {In current information society students should be educated under
   different learning strategies from those used with previous generations.
   Educators are reconsidering methodological strategies fostering active
   learning strategies instead of direct instruction. Among active learning
   strategies we find Flipped Classroom, which switchs traditional learning
   order. Direct instruction is transferred out to the class and in class
   time is dedicated to tasks, discussions or problems solving.
   On this article, we show the results of the application of Flipped
   Classroom in a teaching unit of economics in upper secondary school.
   After its design and implementation of the teaching unit ``Money and
   monetary policy{''}, we applied a questionnaire and we used teacher's
   observation during the process. After the analysis of collected data,
   our main conclusion is that students show a positive opinion, specially
   about the improvements in the attention paid by teachers in the class in
   comparison with the traditional classes.},

Abstract = {Introduction: In 2017, a revamped bachelor of pharmacy program was
   introduced at Monash University and incorporated a predominantly flipped
   classroom-based pedagogy. The attitudes and preferences of students
   towards this program had yet to be assessed using a reliable instrument.
   Since no instrument was readily available, the objective of this study
   was to identify, contextualize, and validate a suitable instrument.
   Methods: We conducted a literature search to identify and adapt a
   validated instrument. Cognitive interviews were conducted to examine
   students' understanding of scales and definitions of items. The
   instrument was then evaluated by education experts for further
   refinement. The reliability of the final instrument was assessed in a
   cohort of students, and unsuitable items were removed.
   Results: Students had issues understanding the scales and specific terms
   used in the original instrument, potentially due to differences in
   terminologies used in the university's context and variance in English
   proficiency levels and exposure. In the preference domain, wording of
   the instrument to present exclusively traditional classroom or
   exclusively flipped classroom statements greatly influenced its
   reliability. This could be due to exposure of students to a
   predominantly flipped classroom environment since inception. The final
   instrument optimized in this study had alpha = 0.85, 0.86, and 0.9 for
   the pre-activities, in-class lectures, and in-class workshops attitude

Abstract = {This study aimed to determine the effects of the traditional classroom
   model, distance education model and flipped classroom model designed
   according to ARCS (attention, relevance, confidence and satisfaction)
   motivation strategies on motivation and academic achievement levels. For
   this purpose, the study was conducted by using an experimental
   pretest-posttest control group design. Purposive sampling was used to
   determine the participants. Frequency, percentage, mean, dependent
   groups t-test and ANOVA test were utilized for data analysis. The
   results indicated that the academic achievement levels of the students
   in the flipped classroom model using ARCS motivation strategies were
   significantly higher than those of the students in the distance
   education classroom model and the traditional classroom model. In
   addition, the training process did not lead to a significant change in
   the motivation of the students in the traditional classroom model and
   distance education classroom model, but did lead to a significant change
   in the motivation of the students in the flipped classroom model. In
   response to the results of the study, various suggestions were made.},

Abstract = {Introduction: The objective of this study was to review and critically
   appraise the medical education literature pertaining to a
   flipped-classroom (FC) education model, and to highlight influential
   papers that inform our current understanding of the role of the FC in
   medical education.
   Methods: A search of the English-language literature querying Education
   Resources Information Center (ERIC), PsychINFO, PubMed, and Scopus
   identified 296 papers related to the FC using either quantitative,
   qualitative, or review methods. Two reviewers independently screened
   each category of publications using previously established exclusion
   criteria. Eight reviewers then independently scored the remaining 54
   publications using either a qualitative, quantitative, or review-paper
   scoring system. Each scoring system consisted of nine criteria and used
   parallel metrics that have been previously used in critical appraisals
   of education research.
   Results: A total of 54 papers (33 quantitative, 4 qualitative, and 17
   review) on FC met a priori criteria for inclusion and were critically
   appraised and reviewed. The top 10 highest scoring articles (five
   quantitative studies, two qualitative studies, and three review papers)
   are summarized in this article.
   Conclusion: This installment of the Council of Emergency Medicine
   Residency Directors (CORD) Academy Critical Appraisal series highlights
   10 papers that describe the current state of literature on the flipped
   classroom, including an analysis of the benefits and drawbacks of an FC
   approach, practical implications for emergency medicine educators, and
   next steps for future research.},

Abstract = {The objective of this mixed research is to analyze the impact of flipped
   classroom in the educational process on the Design of Graphic
   Communication. The sample is made up of 20 students who took the Formal
   Expression I course at a public university in Mexico City during the
   2020 school year. This research proposes the consultation of the videos
   before the class and use of the Sketchbook application during the
   face-to-face session through the mobile devices. The Sketchbook
   application allows analyzing the images of the human face, draw and
   check the dimensions of the objects through the mobile devices. At home,
   the students consulted the videos about the Sketchbook application in
   order to learn the use of this technological tool. The results of
   machine learning (linear regression) indicate that the use of the
   Sketchbook application and mobile devices in the learning process
   positively influence the active role of the students. Flipped classroom
   allows the construction of new educational spaces where students
   actively participate during the educational process. Finally, flipped
   classroom is a pedagogical model that is transforming the organization
   and implementation of the activities in the 21st century with the
   support of technology.},

Title = {Use of a flipped classroom in ophthalmology courses for nursing, dental
   and medical students: A quasi-experimental study using a mixed-methods
   approach},
Journal = {NURSE EDUCATION TODAY},
Year = {2020},
Volume = {85},
Month = {FEB},
Abstract = {Background: Traditional teaching is associated with dilemmas, such as
   low motivation to learn and passive learning. In contrast, use of a
   flipped classroom with the proper learning design has the potential to
   promote accelerated learning, bolster transmission of competencies (Le.,
   critical thinking, communication and problem-solving skills) and improve
   teamwork capacity, all of which are of great significance in
   professional healthcare practice, including nursing, dentistry and
   medicine.
   Objective: The aim of the study was to examine the effects of using a
   flipped classroom in ophthalmology courses for undergraduate nursing
   students, dental students and higher vocational medical students.
   Design: A quasi-experimental design was used with an intervention (n =
   100) and a comparison group (n = 100), pre-/post-testing measures and a
   mixed-methods approach.
   Setting: A university in China.
   Participants: A total of 200 students were included.
   Methods: Students' self-rated learning ability was measured before and
   after the courses, and skill exams were performed after the courses. In
   addition, interviews were conducted with the clinical medical students
   concerning their experiences of the flipped classroom.
   Results: Students' self-rated learning ability improved significantly
   more in the intervention than in the comparison group, for the total
   scale and the three factors `learning goals', `self-efficacy and social
   learning' and `problem-solving'. Skill exam scores were statistically
   significantly better in the intervention than in the comparison group.
   On the whole, the clinical medicine students felt the flipped classroom
   had a positive impact and improved their learning ability as well as
   knowledge in ophthalmology.
   Conclusions: Use of a flipped classroom for nursing, dental and clinical
   medical students in ophthalmology courses shows promising results in the
   form of students' skill exam scores and self-rated learning ability.},

Abstract = {Transport Phenomena is a core subject in Chemical Engineering studies.
   Its fundamentals need significant effort to be understood. Furthermore,
   students must apply theory to solve practical engineering problems, and
   it is usually problem resolution which has the largest weight in course
   assessment. However, due to the high amount of theory that must be
   covered in Transport Phenomena courses, usually little classroom time is
   reserved for practice and problem-solving skills are not worked in
   class. This constitutes a serious misalignment between learning
   activities, expected outcomes and evaluation. In this article, we
   propose the flipped classroom as a suitable methodology to solve this
   issue. As a pilot study, we flipped one unit of the Transport Phenomena
   course of the Bachelor's Degree in Chemical Engineering. Theory was
   provided through whiteboard animated video before the classroom
   sessions. Classroom time was mainly dedicated to participative
   discussion and problem solving in small groups. Satisfaction
   questionnaires were used to monitor student perception of learning
   quality before and after the methodology update. Student judgement on
   the interest of the subject and the value of the learnt concepts boosted
   about 20\% on average with the flipped classroom. Around 70\% of the
   surveyed students reported that the new methodology increased their
   motivation and that it helped them to learn both theory and practice.
   These results indicate that the flipped classroom is suitable for
   highly-technical classes with a large amount of complex theory, and it
   helps in the understanding and application of such theory. (C) 2018

Abstract = {We present the results of a training program with future Primary
   Education teachers on the impact on motivation and perception of
   learning achieved through strategies and techniques associated with
   gamma and flipped-classroom. The program was run in four classroom
   groups (n = 210) at the University of Murcia (Spain) and the aim was to
   analyze the effect that the gamification-based and flipped-classroom
   program has on motivation and learning. Information was collected
   through a perceptions questionnaire. Descriptive statistics are shown;
   mean tests (t of Student and ANOVA of a factor) and Pearson correlations
   between subscales. The data show a very positive impact on motivation,
   the learning achieved, and the strategies applied in the program. Some
   differences between group-class and gender are discussed, and some
   future improvements of the program are put forward.},

   The need for mental health nursing care touches every nursing specialty.
   The concepts are abstract and complex, with many unknowns concerning the
   mind. The flipped classroom (FC) provides an opportunity for students to
   explore the concepts prior to classroom learning. This article describes
   an initiative to integrate an FC approach with a population of

Title = {Self-determination theory and the flipped classroom: a case study of a
   senior secondary mathematics class},
Journal = {MATHEMATICS EDUCATION RESEARCH JOURNAL},
Year = {2021},

Abstract = {Teaching senior secondary mathematics presents a number of challenges,
   such as provision of a prescribed curriculum, homework expectations and
   preparing students for externally imposed high-stakes assessment tasks.
   In order to address these challenges, an increasing number of senior
   secondary mathematics teachers are incorporating a flipped classroom
   approach into their teaching. While enactments of the approach vary, it
   typically involves delegating the more routine instructional
   mathematical content as homework videos, allowing for more targeted
   in-class teaching. Traditionally in the domain of tertiary teaching, it
   is becoming more common in secondary school settings and seems to
   address students' needs for competence, autonomy and relatedness, which
   comprise self-determination theory (SDT). This paper looks at a case
   study undertaken with an Australian grade 12 class where the teacher
   utilised a flipped classroom approach to teach mathematics 2. Data were
   collected through an online survey, interviews and classroom
   observations. The results showed that SDT was an appropriate lens to
   analyse participants' experiences of the approach, with the teacher
   being a particularly strong influence on students' motivation for
   engaging with the approach. The study adds to the limited literature on
   examining enactments of the flipped classroom in senior secondary
   mathematics contexts and has implications for practice in terms of
   identifying the practices and factors which influence students'
   motivations for engaging in mathematics classes.},

Title = {The Effect of Using Flipped Classroom Strategy on the Academic
   Achievement of Fourth Grade Students in Jordan},
Journal = {INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF EMERGING TECHNOLOGIES IN LEARNING},
Year = {2018},
Volume = {13},
Number = {2},
Pages = {110-125},
Abstract = {This study aimed at investigating the effect of flipped classroom
   strategy on the academic achievement in the subject of science among
   fourth grade students in Jordan. The study population consists of all
   fourth grade students in the Directorate of Private Education in Amman
   area, totaling 2134 students during the second semester of the academic
   year 2015-2016. The study sample consists of 44 male and female students
   who were chosen purposely from the study population. The study sample
   was distributed into two groups: the experimental group that consisted
   of 22 students, who has studied according to flipped classroom strategy,
   and the control group that consisted of 22 students, who has studied in
   the ordinary method. To achieve the objectives of the study, an
   achievement test was prepared and its validity and reliability were
   checked. ANCOVA, Means, and Standard Deviations were used to analyze the
   collected research data. The study deduced the following results: 1)
   There are statistically significant differences in the Means on the
   educational achievement test attributed to the teaching strategy, in
   favor of the members of the experimental group, and 2) there are no
   statistically significant differences in the Means on the academic
   achievement test attributed to gender. In light of the findings, the
   study recommended encouraging science teachers to teach students using
   teaching strategies emanated from the use of modern technologies,
   particularly the flipped classroom strategy. In addition, the study
   suggested that colleges of education should train prospective teachers
   on the use of teaching strategies stemming from modern educational
   theories and strategies such as the flipped classroom strategy during
   the period of preparing them to teach. Furthermore, the study
   recommended re-applying this experience and identifying its
   effectiveness at other schools stages and other subjects in other
   content areas.},

Abstract = {This research investigates whether a flipped classroom with
   Communicative Language Teaching (CLT) approach can lead students to
   increased gains in speaking skills within an undergraduate English class
   at the Royal University of Phnom Penh, Cambodia. This was designed to
   utilize pre-class online videos to replace live ``chalk and talk{''}
   lectures, with a variety of CLT activities implemented during class
   time, including discussion-based learning, pair and group work, role
   play, and games. A mixed method was used to analyze different sources of
   data, including pre- and post-tests on speaking, written one of grammar
   and vocabulary, and observations. The experiment was employed with 21
   freshmen of an academic year of 2017-2018 (n=21) to determine any
   differences in their speaking achievements that might be associated with
   a flipped classroom and CLT. The results from the observations and pre
   and post tests indicated that the participants not only enhanced their
   speaking ability but also changed their attiutde toward learning
   English. These results specified that the flipped instruction with the
   CLT activities were effective in improving the participants' speaking
   ability which significantly contributed to better learning outcomes.
   Therefore, it is recommended that English language teachers in Cambodia
   consider implementing a flipped classroom and CLT approach in their
   classrooms.},

Abstract = {Flipped learning is known to be an approach where learners take part in
   the learning process in a different way than in the non-flipped
   classroom and that in both they may deepen their knowledge and develop
   various competencies such as problem-solving and collaboration. Paying
   attention to the characteristics of flipped learning, the purpose of
   this study is to propose practical guidelines for the use of the flipped
   classroom by exploring the teaching and learning processes involved.
   Through a literature review, the 3 P model of teaching and learning was
   applied, and grit, professor support for fostering autonomy, learning
   engagement and perceived achievement were selected as variables for the
   process involved in learning via the flipped mode. In order to
   investigate the relationship between these variables, 121 students in a
   flipped classroom were surveyed. Data were analyzed by path analysis.
   The results showed that the support provided by the professor in terms
   of helping students to develop autonomy significantly predicted
   perceived achievement. Learning engagement mediated the relationship
   between grit and perceived achievement, and between the support given by
   the professor in terms of helping students to develop autonomy and
   perceived achievement. Based on the results, the specific strategies to
   enhance learners' grit, their autonomy and learning engagement are
   discussed for the successful flipped classroom.},

Abstract = {Educational practice and, in particular, the flipped classroom models
   have had a significant impact on higher education recently. Challenging
   students with questions and problem - solving activities to learn course
   material is the educational approach used in the course of ``Physics of
   Environmental Processes{''} that has been taught during the 2019-2020
   academic year within the teaching activities of the Master of Science in
   ``Geophysical Sciences for Seismic Risk{''} at the University of
   Messina. The study of complex systems, such as the relationship between
   aviation and the volcanic ash hazard, is highlighted in this paper. The
   particular subject being discussed in this paper presents the properties

Abstract = {Objectives: The study's objective was to determine students' perception
   of the traditional lecture and other methods of teaching and learning
   the students had already experienced, and to determine students'
   expectations and attitude towards the flipped classroom teaching method.
   Methods: Two focus groups were conducted with 11 undergraduate pharmacy
   students in two pharmacy schools in the United Kingdom. Focus groups
   discussions were audio-recorded, then transcribed verbatim and analysed
   thematically using the inductive method.
   Results: Six key themes were identified: 1) teacher characteristics and
   competence; 2) having the right tools to learn; 3) learning can be
   emotional; 4) group work: what is in it for me?; 5) scaffold the
   delivery of teaching; and 6) to prepare or not to prepare.
   Conclusion: The flipped classroom teaching approach was thought to
   tackle perceived limitations of the traditional lecture including
   limited student engagement and the inappropriate pace of instructions.
   It was also deemed to help students understand the taught subject and
   prepare for summative assessment.},

Title = {The Application of Flipped Classroom Combined With Locus of Control

Journal = {FRONTIERS IN PSYCHOLOGY},

Abstract = {This paper aims to explore the status quo and basic laws of
   entrepreneurship education at the stage of social development in China,
   thereby providing a theoretical basis and practical guidance for the
   cultivation of innovative and entrepreneurial talents in colleges.
   First, a college entrepreneurship education model based on lean
   entrepreneurship theory and flipped classroom was established to provide
   the development of entrepreneurship education with a theoretical
   framework while improving the students' autonomous learning ability.
   Based on the theoretical basis of the influence of the locus of control
   on entrepreneurial motivation in the entrepreneurial process of college
   students, the students who participated in the basic education of
   entrepreneurship among the sophomores in the first semester of the
   2018-2019 academic year of a college in Shanghai were selected as the
   research object. Then, the effect of lean entrepreneurship education
   under the flipped classroom mode was analyzed. Before the start of the
   entrepreneurial basic education course, there was no difference between
   the pretest scores of the research group and the control group students
   (P> 0.05). After the course, there was no difference between the
   posttest scores of the two groups of students (P> 0.05). It can be
   confirmed that, based on the flipped classroom education mode of halving
   the actual number of lectures by teachers, the effect of basic education
   on entrepreneurship for students is not different from the traditional
   teaching effect. Based on the flipped classroom mode, the number of
   people who have reached the level of ``understanding{''} of the text
   target task is the highest, and the number of people who can reach the
   ``comprehensive application{''} level of the high-order target is almost
   0. It means that the realization of the high-order target still needs to
   be strengthened. Lean entrepreneurship education mode is based on lean
   iteration, which is conducive to promoting the development of
   entrepreneurship education in China. Therefore, the application of
   flipped classroom combined with locus of control analysis in lean
   entrepreneurship education for college students can ideally achieve the
   goal of deep learning, which is greatly significant for improving the
   effectiveness of entrepreneurship education.},

Abstract = {This current study aims to investigate the use of multimedia-assisted
   learning in a flipped classroom for fostering the students' autonomous
   learning at EFL University. The students are encouraged to learn
   independently by having multimedia learning sources and they are also
   stimulated to find their difficulties in the learning process.
   Meanwhile, the teacher and students are discussing the solution from the
   students' difficulties during their independent learning in the
   classroom. The successful completion of pre-learning depends on the
   students' responsibilities and enthusiasms. 15 students of the English
   Education department were involved as the participants in this study.
   The data were collected through observation, questionnaire, and
   semi-structured interview. The finding of this study showed that a
   flipped classroom by using multimedia-assisted learning helps the
   students stimulate their autonomous learning because the students feel
   free to explore their creativity through an independent learning
   atmosphere without any tension.},

Title = {Self-regulated learning: the effect on medical student learning outcomes
   in a flipped classroom environment},
Journal = {BMC MEDICAL EDUCATION},
Year = {2020},
Volume = {20},

Abstract = {BackgroundThe flipped-classroom model is increasingly being adopted in
   competency-based medical education. However, it poses a major challenge
   to students who have not mastered self-regulated learning strategies.
   This study explores which self-regulated learning skills affect student
   learning performance in the first 2 years of medical school at a
   university in the midwestern United States.MethodsSurvey data were used
   to assess how 146 first- and second-year medical students' use of
   self-regulated learning strategies affected their performance on
   standardized tests.ResultsBased on the results of regression analysis
   and content analysis, it was found that the use of peer learning and
   help-seeking positively affected the performance of first- and
   second-year students, respectively; whereas the use of rehearsal had a
   negative effect on student learning outcomes.ConclusionsThe study
   findings imply that during the transition period from traditional
   lecture-intensive learning to flipped-classroom learning, promoting peer
   learning and help-seeking could significantly improve students' academic
   achievement.},

Abstract = {Objective: To explore pharmacy students' experiences, barriers, and
   needs of first-year pharmacy students flipped classroom (FC) learning.
   Method: A qualitative study with focus groups was performed. Three focus
   group sessions with seventeen first-year pharmacy students were
   conducted. All sessions were audio-recorded, transcribed, and analysed
   for themes using an inductive thematic analysis approach. Results:
   Students, in general, found FC to be useful for learning and using a
   range of self-regulated learning strategies in the FC environment.
   Barriers identified were primarily to i-lectures and potentially
   hindered motivation and acceptance to pre-classroom preparation.
   Conclusions: There are students' reservations toward flipped classrooms
   attributed to individual motivation and barriers encountered. Students
   transitioning to flipped classroom approach require easy-to-learn and
   use pre-class learning materials tailored to students' level and
   preferences.},

Abstract = {College students' autonomous learning (AL) is becoming more important in
   the information era. The flipped classroom model is gaining great
   attention, for it is viewed as one of the most effective teaching
   strategies for accelerating students' AL. Undoubtedly, educators play a
   significant role in this process. Using a sociocultural lens, this
   qualitative case study focused on the complex and holistic nature of
   enhancing college students' AL and explored the mechanism and routines
   to improve their AL using a flipped teaching model. Qualitative
   interviews from 8 teachers about their experiences in improving
   students' AL in flipped classes, in addition to observations in both
   classrooms and teacher education workshops, and related artefacts, were
   collected and analysed by constant comparative coding. From this
   evidence, a TRACK effect model was constructed and presented via a
   visual circle to explain how college students gradually develop AL in a
   flipped classroom with scaffolds offered by their instructors.},

Month = {JUL},
Abstract = {Objectives: The purpose of this systematic review was to reveal the
   evidence of how the method of flipped classroom was applied in nursing
   education and examine the results associated with this teaching method.
   Data sources: Peer-reviewed studies published from 2013 to 2020 were
   selected from the PubMed, Web of Science, and Science Direct databases.
   Review methods: A systematic review was conducted according to the
   PRISMA Statement Guidelines. Electronic databases were searched using a
   range of keywords, and the findings were integrated into a narrative
   synthesis. Quality appraisal was undertaken.
   Results: In total, 7470 articles were retrieved including the 24 paper
   those were finally selected for the systematic reviews. The themes
   identified were: academic performance outcomes, student perceptions,
   activities, and structures.
   Conclusions: It was determined that the flipped classroom method
   supported learning effectively and increased the quality of teaching.
   Nursing courses are suggested to be structured as flipped classrooms.},

Title = {Application of WeChat-based flipped classroom on root canal filling
   teaching in a preclinical endodontic course},
Journal = {BMC MEDICAL EDUCATION},

Abstract = {Background This study was aimed to evaluate the application of
   WeChat-based flipped classroom in root canal filling teaching in a
   preclinical endodontic course. Methods A two-group comparative study was
   designed. The pre-class test, on-site quiz, and root canal filling on
   extracted premolars were performed by students from a lecture-based
   classroom group (LG, n = 30) and a WeChat-based flipped classroom group
   (WFG, n = 30). Results of the Pre-class test and on-site quiz were
   analyzed by independent samples t-test. Post-filling radiographs were
   taken and evaluated by a specialist in oral radiology who was blinded to
   grouping. Results of root canal fillings were analyzed by the Pearson
   chi-square test. Student responses in questionnaires were analyzed by
   Fisher's exact test. Results The students in WFG could get significantly
   higher scores in the on-site test and make better performances in root
   canal filling than those in LG. In terms of questionnaires, students
   from WFG were perceived to be more motivated to learn, better to
   understand the knowledge, better to improve communication and clinical
   skills, easier to perform root canal filling but spending more time.
   Conclusion The WeChat-based flipped classroom teaching can have a better
   effect than lecture-based teaching on root canal filling learning for
   students with limited endodontic experiences.},

Abstract = {Objective We aimed to develop and evaluate a mobile learning
   (m-learning) design for large group application learning based on
   flipped classroom approach within an integrated curriculum of medical
   faculty. Materials and methods Totally 359 students enrolled in a
   two-credit course during the 2017-2018 academic year. An instructional
   design called 5-Lecture-5 (5L5) was implemented via mobile application.
   This design is a blend of m-learning and flipped classroom approaches,
   with pre-, during-, and post-lecture elements. Data were analysed using
   Chi-square, Mann-Whitney U, and Kruskal-Wallis tests. Open-ended
   questions and course observations were analysed thematically and
   reported together. Results Of the participating students, 26.96\% who
   saw the first announcement examined pre-lecture materials and 55.43\%
   attended face-to-face lecture. Achievement test scores of those who
   attended lecture were significantly higher (p = 0.027). Correct response
   rates for each question were 99.30, 72.10, 58.70, and 94.40\%,
   respectively. Consequently, students demonstrated positive attitude
   towards m-learning (M = 170.15 +/- 28.48). The most preferred positive
   aspects were ``active learning,{''} ``interactive,{''}
   ``entertaining,{''} ``useful,{''} and ``repeatable.{''} Conclusions
   M-learning activities within a flipped classroom with instant feedback
   were found to increase participation and interaction levels of students
   in classroom setting, resulting in their increased enjoyment and
   engagement.},

Abstract = {The new educational perspectives that rely on the ICT and the Internet,
   has allowed the improvement and admission of different ways and models
   to learn. One of them is the flipped classroom, in which the educational
   processes are flipped. This research aims to systematize the
   bibliographic production during 2015-2020 period, regarding the flipped
   classroom application and its impact on the academic performance. The
   methodological design complies with the guidelines of the SALSA
   Framework. When applying the inclusion and exclusion criteria, the final
   sample consisted of 32 articles. The results reveal that 2017 was the
   year where more studies were conducted. Spain being the country with the
   highest incidence. The experiences were carried out to a greater extent
   at the university level and with quasi-experimental or experimental
   empirical designs. The review has concluded that most of the
   investigations show a positive effect or gain over the experimental
   group's academic performance.},

Abstract = {Multimedia-based information technology, especially the flipped
   classroom using micro video technology, has gradually changed the
   traditional classroom teaching and become a new teaching method to
   improve teaching quality. The ``five-ones{''} teaching model combines
   the theory of flipped learning, micro-video theory and learning target
   cognitive hierarchy. Visualization tools can create real-time,
   evidence-based, full-participating classrooms, generating a positive
   effect on classroom teaching reform. Therefore, with the focus on the
   course of Architectural Design of Housing, a number of students of
   X-university majoring in civil construction were involved in an
   experiment of face-to-face teaching in the flipped classroom supported
   by visualization tools under the ``five-ones{''} teaching model. The
   results show that face-to-face teaching in the flipped classroom
   supported by visualization tools under the ``five-ones{''} teaching
   model has a significant effect on improving the quality of course
   teaching, but it also puts higher requirements on the teaching
   environment, teachers' ability and students' self-control.},

Abstract = {The promotion of new teaching models like MOOC and SPOC has spurred an
   exponential growth in the amount of teaching resources. However, the
   current university education system fails to respond to the changing
   scenario. The curriculum teaching is in lack of penitence, timeliness,
   advanced methods and diverse evaluation means. Against this backdrop,
   this paper draws the merits of big data and ontology theory, and creates
   an automatic curriculum ontology construction technology. Coupled with
   new teaching models like SPOC and flipped classroom, the author
   developed a new SPOC-based flipped classroom teaching model driven by
   curriculum ontology. Then, the new teaching model was applied in the
   design of a teaching plan, and verified in the course of Electronic
   Commerce. After a semester of teaching practice, the results show that
   the proposed method is more efficient and universal than the traditional
   ontology construction method; more importantly, our method promotes the
   teaching effect and enhances the students' overall abilities like
   autonomous learning, collaborative research. The research findings
   provide reference for hybrid teaching in the future, and shed new light
   on the reform for individualized and diversified university curriculum
   teaching.},

   Pharmacy Students Blood Pressure Measurement Skills},

Abstract = {For reliable blood pressure measurement, various potential sources of
   inaccuracies need to be considered to avoid incorrect decision-making.
   Pharmacy students should be sensitized and taught the skill accordingly.
   One strategy to teach students' blood pressure measurement skills might
   be through a blended learning approach in a flipped classroom-like
   setting. With a randomized two-arm study among pharmacy students in
   their eighth semester, the required extent of in-class session in the
   scope of a blended learning approach in a flipped classroom-like setting
   was evaluated. Participants' self-confidence and self-perceived
   proficiency were evaluated through a survey, and participants' blood
   pressure measurement performance was assessed by objective structured
   clinical examination (OSCE). Participants' satisfaction with, and
   perception of, the flipped classroom were also surveyed. The extended
   in-class activities did not result in a significantly higher increase of
   participants' OSCE score and self-assessment score when compared to the
   brief in-class session. Both in-class sessions yielded a significant
   increase in the OSCE scores as well as in the self-assessment scores.
   Moreover, the teaching approaches were predominantly well-received by
   the students. The use of both flipped classroom-like approaches improved
   pharmacy students' blood pressure measurement performance, though the
   brief in-class session was sufficient. Students'
   self-confidence/self-perceived proficiency in blood pressure measurement
   skills increased similarly in both settings.},

Abstract = {Aims and objectives To explore the on-campus activities of the flipped
   classroom and their role in nursing students' experiences of mastering
   physiology.
   Background A nurse must be confident in their knowledge of physiology to
   feel confident as a nurse. However, many nursing students do not believe
   in their ability to master physiology. The flipped classroom design
   could facilitate active learning and promote students' confidence and
   competence in physiology.
   Design A design-based research design was employed.
   Methods Twenty-three nursing students enrolled in an anatomy and
   physiology course participated in two focus group interviews and wrote
   two individual reflective notes. The data were analysed by means of
   systematic text condensation and activity theory. Reporting was guided
   by the Consolidated Criteria for Reporting Qualitative Studies (COREQ).
   Results The study findings underscore the importance of careful design
   of on-campus activities within the flipped classroom to support
   students' experiences of mastery in physiology. Four themes were
   identified: (a) preparation which builds a foundation for learning; (b)
   the use of digital tools; (c) learning through dialogue with peers; and
   (d) experience of the expected learning outcomes.
   Conclusions On-campus learning activities within a flipped classroom
   design could support students' experiences of confidence in and mastery
   of physiology. However, the study participants found learner-centred
   activities challenging and described feeling doubtful of their ability
   to master physiology. A didactic framework could take into account the
   circumstance that students perceive educational technology differently.
   When designing on-campus activities, emphasis should be placed on
   collaboration rather than competition to help students develop
   confidence in their knowledge of physiology.
   Relevance to clinical practice It is important to support nursing
   students' knowledge acquisition in bioscience and their development of
   confidence as these skills could enhance their clinical judgment in
   practice. Comprehension of bioscience is necessary to provide safe
   patient care and competent nursing.},

   different Degrees about the relationship between the Flipped Classroom
   methodology and the improvement of attitudinal and motivational aspects,
   and the skills acquired with its implementation. The opinion of the
   students (before and after the implementation of the methodology) has
   been collected using an ad hoc questionnaire. Responses from students in
   different contexts have been considered in order to be able to
   generalize the results, given the interdisciplinarity of the sample. The
   results positively endorse the experience, especially in the perception
   of the competences acquired. However, in relation to the attitudinal and

Title = {The polarizing effect of the online flipped classroom},
Journal = {COMPUTERS \& EDUCATION},
Year = {2020},
Volume = {147},
Month = {APR},
Abstract = {Against the background of the burgeoning use of online learning in
   higher education, and more recently the online flipped classroom, this
   study sets out to evaluate the efficacy of the online flipped classroom.
   To this end, a campus-based course in applied physics for master and
   doctoral students was transformed into an online flipped course. We
   analyse how this transformation and student participation in specific
   asynchronous and synchronous learning activities affect performance for
   the online flipped format. Results reveal that, while there was no
   statistically significant difference in average performance between the
   campus-based and online flipped format, the online flipped format led to
   a significantly larger spread - a polarization - in performance.
   Further, drawing on transactional distance theory, we attribute this
   polarization to a higher oscillation in transactional distance for the
   online flipped format. This link between transactional distance and
   performance constitutes the main theoretical contribution of this paper.
   Our findings speak to the importance of analysing shifts in
   transactional distance across learning activities to better understand
   their potential to bolster student learning. Future research would do
   well to focus on how students experience such shifts in transactional
   distance, and online instructors need to consider how to scaffold
   students during these shifts.},

Abstract = {While ``flipping{''} a classroom has gained attention in K-12 and
   Secondary school programs, there has been relatively no explicit focus
   on its effectiveness as a teaching method for instructional media design
   courses in Higher Education. The purpose of this quasi-experimental
   study was to determine the effectiveness of the flipped classroom
   approach to teaching instructional media design subjects by comparing
   students' academic performance and training satisfaction in traditional
   lecture-based instruction with those in a flipped classroom. A total of
   128 undergraduate students participated voluntarily and were divided
   into a control (n = 62) and an experimental (n = 66) group,
   respectively. The study findings indicated substantial differences in
   both academic performance and training satisfaction between the two
   groups, with the students in the experimental group performing
   significantly better. Specifically, the results showed some determining
   factors associated with training satisfaction that explain why students
   in flipped classes achieved notably higher mastery in the learning
   objectives than their control group peers. This study adds to the
   literature by providing evidence on how a flipped classroom can
   potentially benefit students' academic performance, leading to higher
   training satisfaction and deeper disciplinary understanding in
   instructional media design courses.},

Abstract = {The purpose of this study was to compare community college students'
   learning experiences and performance for lecture-based, active learning,
   and flipped classroom teaching approaches. Participants were
   second-semester computer programming students (n = 103) at a mid-sized
   college of applied arts and technology. Garrison's (2011) Community of
   Inquiry (CoI) framework informed our analysis of students' learning
   experiences within each approach. Overall, active learning resulted in
   the highest mean scores for teaching, social, and cognitive presence. In
   particular, students rated teaching presence significantly higher for
   the active-learning approach than the lecture-based approach. Students
   rated social presence significantly higher for the active-learning and
   flipped classroom approaches compared to the lecture-based. There were
   no significant differences among the three approaches with respect to
   cognitive presence or learning performance. Student comments indicated
   that all three approaches had distinct benefits and challenges regarding
   teaching, social and cognitive presence. Regardless of the teaching
   approach employed in this study, five desired learning characteristics
   emerged based on student feedback including clarity, flexibility,
   opportunities for application, timely guidance and feedback, and
   cognitive engagement.},

Title = {Physiology education for intensive care medicine residents: A 15-minute
   interactive peer-led flipped classroom session},
Journal = {PLOS ONE},
Year = {2020},
Volume = {15},
Number = {1},
Month = {JAN 24},
Abstract = {Introduction
   In acute care medicine, knowledge of the underlying (patho)-physiology
   is of paramount importance. This may be especially relevant in intensive
   care medicine, where individual competence and proficiency greatly
   depend on knowledge and understanding of critical care physiology. In
   settings with time constraints such as intensive care units (ICUs), time
   allotted to education is often limited. We evaluated whether
   introduction of a short, interactive, peer-led flipped classroom session
   is feasible and can provide ICU residents with a better understanding of
   critical care physiology.
   Materials and methods
   Using the flipped classroom concept, we developed a 15-minute peer-led
   interactive ``physiology education{''} session to introduce a total of
   44 residents to critical care physiology. Using a nine-item electronic
   survey with open questions and a five-point Likert scale, we analysed
   the overall concept with regard to feasibility, motivation, and
   subjective learning of critical care physiology.
   Results
   The overall rate of response to the survey was 70.5\% (31/44). The
   residents reported that these sessions sparked their interest (p =
   0.005, Chi square 10.52), and that discussion and interaction during
   these sessions had promoted their knowledge and understanding. Both
   novice and experienced residents reported that new knowledge was
   imparted (both p< 0.0001, Chi-square 32.97 and 25.04, respectively).
   Conclusions
   In an environment with time constraints such as the ICU, a 15-minute,
   interactive, peer-led flipped classroom teaching session was considered
   feasible and generally appeared useful for teaching critical care
   physiology to ICU residents. Responses to questions on questionnaires
   indicated that teaching sessions sparked interest and increased
   motivation. This approach may theoretically induce a modification in
   professional behaviour and promote self-directed learning. We therefore
   support the use of peer-led flipped classroom training sessions in the
   ICU. Whether these sessions result in improved ICU care should be
   addressed in subsequent studies.},

Title = {South African students' perceptions of the flipped classroom: A case
   study of higher education},
Journal = {INNOVATIONS IN EDUCATION AND TEACHING INTERNATIONAL},
Abstract = {Universities have traditionally made use of the face-to-face model of
   lectures and tutorials as a passive mode of course instruction. When
   lectures are made available online and class time is used for conceptual
   understanding and cognitive skills among students, the approach is known
   as `flipping' the classroom. The purpose of this study was to explore
   students' perceived experiences of flipped classrooms at a South African
   university. A quantitative survey method was used in this research study
   to elicit students' perceptions about a flipped classroom. A structured
   questionnaire called the Student Perception of Instruction Questionnaire
   was used to collect data from 130 students enrolled for a Database
   course over a 4 week period. The results show that the students'
   experienced the flipped classroom as positive and enjoyable. Even though
   they worked harder in the course and needed more technical assistance,
   most would opt for a similar course in the future.},

Abstract = {The development of Internet technology has injected new impetus into the
   reform of education, and also posed new challenges to the traditional
   teaching mode. In recent years, as an extension of educational
   informationization, the flipped classroom has developed rapidly, and
   academic attention has increased year by year. At present, the flipped
   classroom in Colleges and universities in China has penetrated into many
   disciplines. Dance teaching should conform to the development of the
   times, optimize the teaching mode of dance education, open up innovative
   consciousness, and form a multi-channel teaching pattern. On the basis
   of discussing the theoretical and practical research on the mode of
   flipping classroom teaching in the dance teaching, this paper puts
   forward and designs the structure map of the pattern of the teaching
   mode of the flipped class in the ordinary university, and carries out a
   4 month teaching experiment for the dance students. Through the analysis
   and verification of the data from the investigation and feedback, the
   conclusion is that the teaching mode of the dance flipping classroom has
   significant effect on improving the students' basic dance quality, dance
   performance and autonomous learning ability.},

Abstract = {The flipped classroom method is beginning to redefine the classroom
   paradigm. It combines the deductive and the inductive paradigms and, as
   such, it is an emerging hybrid inductive/ deductive methodology. The
   advantages of using such methodology include facilities for the
   application of a higher cognitive process in which students take up
   greater responsibility for their learning, among others. The goal of
   this paper is to characterize the flipped classroom as an innovative
   educational method and to understand its nature, benefits, limitations
   and reach in higher education, and its contribution to the breakup of
   traditional paradigms. It examines the challenges faced by educators who
   teach the new generations that make intensive use of technology to
   communicate daily, as well as those faced by the students. It explores
   the paradigm shift in relation to traditional and linear education,
   seeking more efficient education alternatives. The study involved a
   review of the literature, aiming to establish the state of the art of
   the phenomenon under study. Among the findings, it is important to
   highlight that students in flipped classrooms tend to achieve learning
   results that are significantly better than those of students in
   traditional classrooms, and to feel equally satisfied with the learning
   environment.},

Abstract = {The transfer of educational activities to the online environment within
   blended learning, which was also accelerated by the COVID-19 pandemic,
   increases the risk of growing student procrastination. This article
   describes the design of the flipped class, which is designed so that
   students are supported and motivated to continuously perform individual
   tasks. Great emphasis in the described design of the flipped classroom
   is placed on supporting students in their activities outside the
   classroom. It is in this part of blended learning that procrastination
   is a frequent cause of students' failure, not just in mathematics. The
   effectiveness of our proposed inverted class design has been
   experimentally verified. Statistical analysis of the data showed that
   students had a statistically significant reduction in procrastination
   behavior during the course of the experiment. The proposed flipped
   classroom design has the potential to increase students' self-regulatory
   skills, which has been reflected in a change in their approach to
   learning responsibilities. Students' approach to online learning outside
   the classroom has changed, and thus their probability of successfully
   completing the combinatorics course has increased statistically
   significantly.},

Abstract = {This article details a training programme in Flipped Classroom
   methodology offered to university teachers. The training activity was
   part of a strategic teaching innovation project at the Universidad
   Pontificia Comillas in Madrid. The aim of the project as a whole was to
   contribute to the improvement of teaching and learning processes at the
   university via new educational models using ICT. The article describes
   the implementation of a training programme in the Flipped Classroom
   model aimed at university professors and the subsequent assessment of
   the programme by the participants. Data were collected via a
   questionnaire that was completed by 23 university professors from a
   range of disciplines. The results showed that although the professors
   employ new educational models with the support of digital technologies,
   they face time and space difficulties in the design, creation and
   implementation of tasks in the classroom. However, the students were
   interested in new ways of learning.},

Abstract = {The flipped model assisted with technologies has an edge over the
   non-flipped model. Through collecting, generalizing, systemizing, and
   summarizing around 70 publications from SSCI, A\&HCI, and EI Compendex
   databases, it was concluded that the flipped approach could assimilate
   and adapt learners' schemata before class. In class, the pre-class
   schemata activation and construction have laid a solid foundation for
   students' in-class learning activities. Students could achieve
   successful schemata modification and reconstruction with the assistance
   of both their partners and teachers through collaborative learning. In
   the non-flipped classroom, however, they not only lacked the preclass
   round of schemata assimilation and adaptation but also could not
   successfully activate their existing schemata. After class, students in
   the flipped model with technology could communicate with teachers
   through the online platform to continue their schemata adaptation
   process. Future empirical studies are needed to identify the
   effectiveness of flipped classrooms assisted with technologies.},

Abstract = {The inclusion of active learning methodologies in university degrees,
   such as Flipped Classroom and Role-playing require a higher degree of
   student involvement, greater dynamism in learning and increased content
   interaction. The main objective of this study is to evaluate the
   effectiveness of the Flipped Classroom and Role-Playing (FC + RP)
   methods as compared to the traditional lecturer-based (LB) method, on
   the academic performance of social work students. It also aims to
   evaluate the effectiveness of the FC + RP in terms of satisfaction with
   the subject and the method used, and finally, with respect to the
   perceived difficulty of each theoretical topic. The hypotheses stating
   that students using FC+RP methods obtained a higher academic
   performance, and a lower perception of difficulty of the content as
   compared to students using the traditional LB method were verified.
   However, it was not verified that students using FC + RP methods have
   greater satisfaction with the subject and the method used.},

Abstract = {The following paper reports the results of a quantitave research study
   sought to analyze the incidence of closed Facebook communities to
   enhance English vocabulary development in high school students by using
   the Flipped classroom method. Technological tools are a fundamental part
   of the English teaching learning process. The use of virtual strategies
   facilitate teaching and give students virtual learning environments
   where they can have real contact with the English speaking world.
   Therefore, the need of studying different virtual resources and their
   effectiveness in 21st century teaching practices. Low vocabulary level
   mainly in matching strategies and completing sentences was detected
   after the results of the KET diagnostic test applied to students. The
   results evidenced the need of implementing a didactic sequence based on
   the Flipped Classroom method. Thus, a series of ten sessions by means of
   the implementation of closed Facebook communities were developed.
   Quizlet tool was also used, in order to keep track of students'
   participations and classroom scoring. After the implementation, a final
   KET test was applied. The final results showed 34\% improvement in
   matching and 33.5\% completing sentences components. Similarly, the
   final test results evidenced students' ability to find an unknown word
   in reading paragraphs. The data proved the positive incidence of
   Facebook closed groups and flipped classroom to develop vocabulary level
   in English as a foreign language.},

Abstract = {The teaching-learning process in the university requires a continuous
   adaptation to the new methodological proposals. The master classes have
   given way to active students, open to developing the necessary skills
   for their professional future. The flipped classroom model acquires
   greater importance in the university classrooms because of its
   constructivist approach, transferring the teacher's focus to the
   student. Some of the most relevant aspects of this learning model are
   described based on a literature review. The results are in line with the
   search for skills such as autonomy, interpretative analysis and

Abstract = {New Technologies of Information and Communication in the university
   classrooms have promoted the development of alternative pedagogical
   modalities to the traditional ones. The Flipped Classroom, has been
   considered as a suitable model for teaching engineering subjects, due to
   it is useful for optimizing the time of work in the classroom and
   preparing materials for students learning outside it. In this study, an
   experience based on the Flipped Classroom model developed with 151
   engineering students is presented. Through an ad hoc designed
   questionnaire, their perceptions about the experience have been
   collected experience with materials and resources, teaching aids and the
   role of the student. The main results suggest that the model favors an
   active role for the students, and demands a greater effort and daily
   follow-up. Likewise, some proposals for improvement are presented for
   its future development.},

Abstract = {The advent and exponential evolution of the Internet, with the
   democratic availability of access to information in enormous volume and
   the diversified existing digital technological resources, have presented
   great challenges to Teaching and to traditional teaching models, through
   the emergence of new educational paradigms. Within this broad context,
   the purpose of this article is to reflect on the methodology of teaching
   b-learning and its methodological variant called the flipped classroom,
   with the center of reflection being the teachers and students in a
   discussion about such as information and communication technologies
   (ICT) are used in these methodologies and what are the possible impacts
   that are involved the people involved in the teaching and learning
   process. In the context of an ongoing PhD research on the potential and
   challenges of implementing the flipped classroom in Higher Education,
   this article is finished with the presentation of partial results
   obtained with field experiments, carried out with 81 students, through
   the methodology of action-research, using as instruments: an experiment
   protocol, a instructions to learners, an observation grid and a

Abstract = {Assuming the evident relationship between innovation and technology, and
   the corresponding impact in the educational field, this article
   contemplates a systematic review on the resource on flipped classroom
   model in non-tertiary education. 181 studies were reviewed with the
   purpose of establishing and apprehending the connections between the
   flipped learning and its potential to promote curriculum innovation.
   Data analysis allowed the building of a three-level model in which the
   relations of the flipped classroom model and curriculum are organized in
   terms of (i) outcomes support, (ii) institutional change and (iii)
   classroom instruction modus operandi. Results suggest substantial
   potential of the flipped model to flip the curriculum and even the
   school culture. To meet such end, innovation must be perceived as an
   institutional strategy, making sure all stakeholders hold a part in the
   adaptative process of fostering change. Moreover, there is evidence that
   the model can ease the articulation and consolidation of constructivist
   approaches in schooling, a perspective that enhances the movement for
   student-centred logics in education. The review novelty lies on its
   building of a model that can work as a guide for reflecting on the
   approach and for underpinning future action.},

Abstract = {In order to improve the existing problems in the teaching process of IT
   English courses and improve the quality of IT English, this paper
   conducts a research on the flipped classroom teaching mode of IT English
   based on SPOC. The present situation of IT English teaching is analyzed,
   and the problems existing in the teaching process are also analyzed. On
   the basis of the above thought, with the support of SPOC platform build
   IT turn English classroom teaching mode, namely, by setting the course
   target, learning for class in advance, choose high-quality class,
   learning information collection, upload the related resources, and do a
   good job in teaching design complete teacher preparation, and design the
   specific teaching unit of teaching process, teaching quality evaluation
   model was constructed. In this way, the teaching quality evaluation
   results of IT English flipped classroom are obtained, in order to
   further improve the teaching quality. The experimental results show that
   the flipped English teaching mode based on SPOC can effectively improve
   students' performance and increase students' average daily learning time
   and course satisfaction, and the practical application effect is good.},

Title = {Are first year students ready for a flipped classroom? A case for a
   flipped learning continuum},
Journal = {INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF EDUCATIONAL TECHNOLOGY IN HIGHER EDUCATION},
Year = {2019},
Volume = {16},
Month = {MAR 1},
Abstract = {In our first year science and sustainability education subject, how to
   best support pre-service teachers to meet the conceptual demands of
   understanding important socio-ecological challenges such as climate
   change is a key focus of our teaching practice. In this multi-method
   case study, we explore how a flipped classroom supported students'
   engagement and learning by way of an end-of-semester student survey, and
   a narrative account of our experiences, as educators, enacting the
   active learning strategies in class. Analysis of survey data showed that
   while students reported a high level of engagement with the videos and
   believed that they supported their learning, opinions were divided as to
   whether a flipped classroom was preferred over traditional lectures.
   Additionally, our reflections on how students engaged with the active
   learning strategies revealed that significant time was required at the
   start of class to review key concepts, as students appeared reluctant to
   engage independently with the planned activities-particularly those that
   involved more challenging science concepts. Informed by these findings,
   we propose a flipped learning continuum that fosters different levels of
   student-centred learning and autonomy, depending on students' learning
   needs and their readiness for a flipped learning approach. In the
   context of the first year experience, specifically, some teacher-led
   instruction may be appropriate in a flipped classroom to support
   students' transition to learning in higher education.},

Abstract = {The purpose of this quantitative study is to analyse the impact of the
   flipped classroom during the teaching-learning process of linear
   functions considering data science and machine learning (linear
   regression). The sample is comprised of 72 students in the basic
   mathematics class during the 2018 school year. The results of the
   machine learning show that watching audiovisual content before class,
   doing exercises collaboratively during class using the application
   GeoGebra, and doing laboratory practices after class using the
   application GeoGebra have a positive influence on the development of
   mathematical skills. Data science identifies three predictive models on
   the use of the flipped classroom and the student profile using the
   decision tree technique. Finally, the flipped classroom facilitates the
   creation of new educational spaces via the use of technology and allows
   creative activities to be organized before, during and after class.},

Title = {``Flipped classroom{''}-A future concept for student teaching in

Journal = {OPHTHALMOLOGE},

Abstract = {Background ``Flipped classroom{''} is a didactic teaching concept in
   which learning contents are prepared by self-study with arranged tools
   before the classroom session. The concept offers the advantage of a
   uniform knowledge base for the students at the beginning of the course
   and also the advantage of a greater theoretical knowledge, which creates
   more opportunities for practical exercises, application and
   consolidation in the subsequent joint teaching units. This study
   describes the establishment and application of such a model in student
   teaching in ophthalmology and analyzes the student's evaluation.
   Methodology For the winter term 2018/2019, a new teaching module was
   designed and established in a cooperation between the department of
   ophthalmology and the Institute for Education and Study Affairs (IfAS)
   at the medical faculty of the University of Munster. A uniform training
   of the lecturers as well as a preparation of the students for the
   restructuring took place. After the course the evaluation of the
   students was recorded and evaluated using a standardized online
   evaluation. Results Between the winter semester 2018/2019 and the winter
   semester 2019/2020, an average of 112.3 +/- 4.0 students were taught
   with the ``flipped classroom{''} model. Of these 93.7\% were able to
   give an assessment. In the previous semesters with the old teaching
   concept (summer semester 2015 to summer semester 2018), the average
   number of students was 115.4 +/- 15.1 with an assessment rate of 93.3\%.
   The new teaching concept achieved on average a better assessment than
   the old module. Conclusion With a ``flipped classroom{''} space and
   flexibility can be generated for a more individual course preparation
   and at the same time a higher practical part. Further studies are needed
   to analyze whether this also enables a sustainable transfer of
   knowledge.},

Abstract = {Flipped Classroom is a methodology that is being more common at
   university level, surely, due to the active role the students take on
   the learning process. In this research a systematic review of this
   methodology at university level in Spain is carried out. The analysis of
   109 research studies point out the gradual increment of the number of
   publications about this topic both, in Spanish and English, as time goes
   by that could be related to an increment of the use of this methodology
   at university classes. Despite the fact there are few universities that
   consider this methodology as part of their common praxis, almost half of
   Spanish Universities have had a preliminary contact with it. The vast
   majority of these experiences have been applied to social sciences and
   law area, as well as engineering and architecture, using fundamentally
   quantitative designs and techniques. The main objectives of these type
   of research studies were measure the impact on the academic performance
   and discover the satisfaction of the experience. Although there is not a
   clear conclusion about the effectiveness of Flipped Classroom on the
   students' academic performance, a large amount of research studies
   points out positive or positive and neutral general conclusions.
   Finally, in view of this results, recommendations and future research
   topics are discussed.},

Title = {Implementation of a ``Flipped Classroom{''} for Neurosurgery Resident

Abstract = {Introduction: Engaging residents across a multiyear training spectrum is
   challenging given the heterogeneity of experience and limited time
   available for educational activities. A flipped classroom model, in
   which residents prepare ahead of time for mentored topic discussions,
   has potential advantages. Methods: We implemented a curriculum
   consisting of topics distributed across the specialty. Weekly, each
   resident was randomly assigned to research a specific aspect of an
   assigned topic appropriate to his or her level of experience: junior
   residents about what characterizes each clinical entity, midlevel
   residents about when to intervene, and chief residents about how to
   administer treatment. Residents completed an anonymous survey 6 months
   after implementation. Board examination performance was assessed before
   and after implementation. Results: A total of 12 residents participated
   in the program. Weekly, 1.750.40 hours were spent in preparation, with
   senior residents reporting less time than junior residents. All
   residents indicated that the accumulation of experience across 7 years
   of residency was a major advantage of this program, and all preferred it
   to lectures. Performance on the board examination significantly
   increased after implementation (from 316 +/- 36 to 468 +/- 45, p<0.05).
   Conclusions: The flipped classroom is a viable approach to resident
   education and is associated with increased engagement and improved
   performance using validated knowledge-assessment tools.},

Abstract = {Background: The flipped classroom is an active method where information
   in delivered before class and the time allocated for it is dedicated to
   achieving more complex learning objectives. Diverse resources are used
   in each phase of the methodology. However, Web 2.0 or ``Social Web{''}
   tools allow greater personal and remote interaction. Aim: To describe
   the perception about flipped classroom methodology implemented using web
   2.0 tools in 48 medical students from the University Mayor. Material and
   Methods: The students were invited to view four video-classes available
   on Edpuzzl. During the activity, questions about the topic were inserted
   to promote understanding, research, and teamwork, then the topic was
   discussed using Case-Based Learning through the Quizizz program. A
   survey composed of 12 closed items and an open question was applied to
   analyze the perceptions of students. Data were analyzed using the SPSS
   and Atlas-Ti programs. Results A high satisfaction rate was observed
   about the way in which the content, discussion and communication of the
   information was presented. The methodology encouraged the development of
   generic competences, but it was not always positively perceived.
   Conclusions: The flipped classroom methodology developed with Edpuzzle
   was very well evaluated by students. This teaching method may be
   particularly useful in the epidemiological context of COVID-19 and other
   situations which require distant learning.},

   that, as researcher of the Business Law Section of the Department of
   Private Law of the University of Barcelona, I have developed in the
   Business Law discipline of the ADE Degree, taught at the Faculty of

   methodology of the flipped classroom, and its complementation with the
   resolution of practical cases. The application of this methodology has
   been particularly useful in order to correct the traditional
   demotivation on the part of the students in the classroom, their lack of
   attendance to class, as well as the lack of real involvement of
   university students in a learning process in which, each time moreover,
   they are called to assume a leading role under the guidance of the

Abstract = {The Advanced Cardiac Life Support (ACLS) training aims to help nurses
   establish the basic competence of the comprehension of
   electrocardiograms (ECG/EKG). However, learners usually have difficulty
   memorizing the meanings of different EKG waveforms, which could
   represent clinical symptoms or even the feeling of dying, via
   traditional instruction. Some serious problems could lead to death if
   the nursing staff do not make correct judgments and provide timely
   treatment. Thus, this paper reports an explorative study investigating
   the effects of a flipped classroom approach on nursing staffs' ACLS
   learning achievement. A 2-week experiment was conducted to compare the
   learning achievement of the nursing staff who learned with the ACLS
   situation-based flipped classroom approach to those who learned with the
   ACLS traditional flipped approach. The experimental results show that
   the nursing staff who learned with the proposed approach had better
   learning achievements, motivation, and satisfaction than those who
   learned with the ACLS traditional flipped approach.},

Abstract = {This study uses an integrated pedagogical tool for knowledge learning as
   an on-line tool for flipped classroom activities and as an off-line
   capability training tool. Theoretically, the Experiential Learning Cycle
   (ELC) plays a critical role in promoting students learning effectiveness
   and performance. However, a dearth of research has applied M-learning
   and flipped classroom in combination with the ELC stages such as
   concrete experience, reflective observation, abstract conceptualization,
   and active experimentation to examine the knowledge and ability learning
   outcomes for students. This study integrates the On line to Off line
   (O2O) classroom development and usage derived from the four stages of
   ELC based on on-line knowledge learning and off-line ability training in
   Microeconomics courses. The results revealed significant improvements in
   students learning outcomes after O2O mode was implemented. In comparison
   with traditional teaching methods, not only does O2O teaching
   significantly improve the students' learning result of professional
   knowledge, but O2O teaching also significantly enhanced the capabilities
   of the students. Furthermore, this study reports the findings from major
   activities of each ELC stage in O2O classroom practice along with the
   mapping of on-line learning and off-line training included in the
   aforementioned stages. Finally, the study provides pedagogical
   implications and future research directions.},

Title = {A flipped classroom model for inquiry-based learning in primary
   education context},
Journal = {RESEARCH IN LEARNING TECHNOLOGY},
Year = {2020},
Volume = {28},
Abstract = {A multi-case study will be presented in this publication which aimed to
   address an important gap in the current literature concerning the
   effective implementation of a flipped classroom (FC) model in a
   particular educational setting. There has been limited research focusing
   on utilising a FC model within the primary education context despite its
   potential benefits for young students, such as facilitating
   student-centred inquiry-based learning (IBL) and developing their higher
   order cognitive skills. This multi-case study has been drawn from
   authors' collaborative action research project with other teacher
   participants, during which the authors explored the effective ways in
   which a FC model can be utilised to promote students' IBL in primary
   school settings. The authors first develop an inquiry-based flipped
   classroom (IB-FC) model and applied the model into five primary schools
   in Cyprus for a school year (2017-2018). A total number of five
   teachers, 77 students and 48 of their parents were invited to
   participate in the project. A large volume of qualitative data was
   collected mainly through classroom observations and interviews. Data
   analysis of teachers', students' and parents' experiences and
   perceptions led to the development of seven universal design principles.
   These principles can be used to support primary school teachers'
   attempts to design effective instructions using the IB-FC model.},

Title = {Multilevel factor analysis of flipped classroom in dental education: A
   3-year randomized controlled trial},
Journal = {PLOS ONE},
Year = {2021},
Volume = {16},
Number = {9},
Abstract = {Purpose Previous studies have rarely attempted to test the confounding
   factors that may affect learning outcomes of the flipped classroom. The
   purpose of this study was to assess how flipped classrooms affect the
   acquisition of knowledge in clinical dental education based on
   multilevel factor analysis. Method The authors conducted a 3-year (2017,
   2018, and 2019) randomized controlled trial in a series of introductory
   prosthodontics courses in dental education. A total of 137 participants
   were randomly assigned to flipped classroom (n = 70, 51\%) or lecture (n
   = 67, 49\%) formats. The flipped group was instructed to self-learn
   knowledge-based content through online preparation materials, including
   videos and text, while the lecture group was given text only. Both
   groups were provided with the same study content and opportunities for
   different styles of learning. The session attendance rate and number of
   times the materials were accessed were monitored. Individual and team
   readiness assurance tests (IRAT/TRAT) were conducted to evaluate
   knowledge acquisition. A multilevel linear regression analysis was
   conducted on both instructional styles (flipped vs. lecture) as an
   intervention factor, and confounding factors that could affect the
   outcomes were implemented. Results The average number of online accesses
   was 2.5 times per session in the flipped group and 1.2 in the lecture
   group, with a significant difference (p < .05). The average IRAT score
   was significantly higher in the flipped than in the lecture group
   (effect size {[}ES] 0.58, p < .001). The number of online accesses was
   significantly and positively correlated with IRAT scores (0.6 {[}0.4,
   0.8]). The instructional style was significantly and positively
   correlated with TRAT scores (coefficient {[}95\% confidence interval]:
   4.6 {[}2.0, 7.3]), but it was not correlated with IRAT (4.3 {[}-0.45,
   9.0]). Conclusions The flipped classroom was more effective than the
   lecture format regarding knowledge acquisition; however, the decisive
   factor was not the instructional style but the number of individual
   learning occasions. The employment of the flipped classroom was the
   decisive factor for team-based learning outcomes.},

Title = {Fast-track flipping: flipped classroom framework development with
   open-source H5P interactive tools},
Journal = {BMC MEDICAL EDUCATION},
Year = {2021},
Volume = {21},
Number = {1},
Month = {JUN 22},
Abstract = {Background The availability and popularity of laptops, tablet PCs and
   smartphones in private and work environments offers considerable
   potential for reasonably integrating blended learning formats into
   structured medical learning environments. The promising educational
   principle of the flipped classroom (FC) provides the opportunity to
   effectively combine e-learning and face-to-face teaching within a single
   framework. However, similar to most blended learning formats, the FC
   requires a solid groundwork of structured digitized learning content. As
   rearranging a whole curriculum is intense and time consuming, physicians
   occupied simultaneously in clinical practice and teaching may be
   confronted with a lack of time during this process. Methods We developed
   two straightforward approaches to transforming a pre-existing,
   lecture-based otolaryngology curriculum into interactive videos within a
   Moodle learning management system. Special attention was given to
   reducing individual working time for medical professionals. Thus, while
   one approach was mainly guided by a medical professional to control the
   content-related quality of video processing, we investigated an
   alternative approach outsourcing work to a technician. Afterwards, the
   working time was analysed and compared. The resulting videos were
   revised with the H5P plugin for moodle to adjust the content where
   necessary. Results We identified a fast-track approach for creating
   structured e-learning content suitable for flipped-classroom-based
   lectures, other blended learning formats, or even providing a whole
   curriculum online. The alternative approach significantly reduced
   working time for medical professionals but did not impair the
   content-related quality significantly. Conclusions The use of H5P
   interactive tools via Moodle LMS provides a major procedural benefit by
   allowing the easy adjustment of pre-existing video material into
   suitable online content. Reasonably outsourcing work to technicians can
   significantly reduce the working time of medical professionals without
   decreasing the quality of learning content. The presented workflow can
   be used as a flexible approach for flipped classroom frameworks or other
   blended learning strategies where interactive videos are applicable.},

Abstract = {Higher education faces a new challenge after the entry into force of the
   European Higher Education Area and its evaluation by competences. The
   challenge focuses on adapting traditional teaching and learning
   processes to new methodological proposals. The Flipped Classroom model
   focuses its educational activity on the programming of tasks taught
   outside the classroom, while in the classroom there is an exchange of
   opinions and reflections guided by the teacher. The aim of this study is
   to provide relevant evidence on the application of this pedagogical
   strategy in higher education. The systematic review made it possible to
   analyze research that indicates that the application of active
   methodologies favors the development of autonomy, critical thinking and
   the acquisition of digital skills. The results show that the
   implementation of the inverted classroom in the university system finds
   collaborative and cooperative work among its strengths, and its success
   depends on both the student and the teacher.},

Abstract = {Students have different learning approaches and acquire knowledge in
   different ways owing to their varied perceptions and grasping abilities.
   Treating students equally, following the traditional teacher-cantered
   approach, may not be effective and calls for innovations in knowledge
   dissemination. This article takes a student-centric approach to
   implement a `flipped classroom' model in an engineering course for
   constructivism (i.e. experience-based learning), and students'
   personalized learning. The performance of the flipped classroom approach
   is compared with the traditional lecturing approach using four lenses:
   students' grades, students' reflection using three surveys at different
   stages during the semester, teacher's observation, and peer observation.
   In most of the existing approaches, analysis of the qualitative survey
   data is performed manually without computer assistance, and therefore
   these are criticized for being primeval and instinctive. In this
   research, a novel approach, based on fuzzy logic, is devised to evaluate
   the qualitative survey responses from the students. It is shown in this
   research, that the linguistic survey responses can be summarized in an
   index more meaningfully using a fuzzy logic-based approach. The results
   further showed that the flipped classroom model helped students to
   improve their grades and enhance engagements with their teacher and
   their peers. Increased interaction, during interactive class activities,
   was instrumental in evolving students' problem-solving and critical
   analysis skills towards better learning experiences. Furthermore,
   students' survey results, analyzed using the novel fuzzy indexing and a
   non-parametric statistical test showed that the intervention in the form
   of flipped classes was effective and found to be statistically
   significant. The findings of this study may help other academics,
   endeavoring for experience-based, and students' personalized learning.},

Abstract = {This article reports on a study which employed a flipped classroom
   strategy to increase the amount of peer dialogue among a group of
   Iranian EFL learners. The flipped strategy used in this study required
   the students to study some online materials provided for students via a
   social network called Telegram. Before attending the class, the
   participants watched videos related to the topic of each lesson, studied
   online texts that included the bolded vocabulary, and listened to audio
   clips related to the focus of every session's discussion. The analysis
   of audio-recordings of peer collaborative talk indicated that the
   flipped strategy, as compared to the traditional teaching, significantly
   increased collaborative peer dialogue among the learners. Finally,
   implications of the study for language teachers and researchers
   interested in this area of inquiry are discussed.},

Title = {Implementation of flipped classroom combined with problem-based
   learning: an approach to promote learning about hyperthyroidism in the
   endocrinology internship},

Abstract = {BackgroundWith the development of medicine, new teaching methods, such
   as flipped classroom and problem-based learning (PBL), have received
   much attention in medical education. However, the implementation of
   flipped classroom combined with PBL in endocrinology education has not
   been well investigated. Considering that both two teaching methods may
   complement each other, therefore, the aim of this study was to evaluate
   students' learning effectiveness acceptability of the pedagogy between
   traditional lecture-based teaching methods and the combination of
   flipped classrooms with PBL teaching methods in the endocrinology
   internship.Methods74 fourth-year medical students at the Bengbu Medical
   College were enrolled in the endocrinology internship. Hyperthyroidism
   was chosen for the content of this study. The participants were randomly
   allocated into either the combination group of flipped classroom with
   PBL (CG) or the traditional lecture-based classroom group (TG). Both a
   pre-quiz and a post-quiz were conducted before and after the classes,
   respectively. All questions in the quizzes were classified into two
   aspects, basic theoretical knowledge and clinical case analyses based on
   the Bloom's Taxonomy. The scores were compared and students were
   required to complete the questionnaire to evaluate their perceptions and
   experience.ResultsThe mean post-quiz scores of both the TG and the CG
   were higher than those of the pre-quiz. Additionally, the post-quiz
   showed that students in the CG had significantly higher scores in the
   TG. Further analysis found that after class, only the difference in
   clinical case analysis between CG and TG was significant. The scores of
   all items in the questionnaires were higher in the CG than in the TG.
   More students agreed that the combined teaching method could help to
   improve their performance, at the same time, it could increase their
   workload.ConclusionsThe combination of the flipped classroom and PBL
   teaching approach could be a better option over the traditional
   lecture-based classroom in the teaching of hyperthyroidism during
   endocrinology internship, although it can increase students' workload.
   To be widely accepted and implemented, further optimizations are
   required.},

Title = {A Learning Analytics Approach to Investigating Factors Affecting EFL
   Students' Oral Performance in a Flipped Classroom},
Journal = {EDUCATIONAL TECHNOLOGY \& SOCIETY},
Year = {2018},
Volume = {21},

Abstract = {Flipped classrooms have been widely adopted and discussed by school
   teachers and researchers in the past decade. However, few studies have
   been conducted to formally evaluate the effectiveness of flipped
   classrooms in terms of improving EFL students' English oral
   presentation, not to mention investigating factors affecting their
   flipped learning outcomes. In this study, an online community-based
   flipped learning approach was proposed for an EFL oral presentation
   course; moreover, a learning analytics approach was used to analyze
   factors affecting the students' oral presentation outcomes. An 18-week
   research design was implemented with the online community-based flipped
   classroom using Facebook as the platform for facilitating and recording
   peer-to-peer interactions during the flipped learning process. In
   addition, the students' learning performance and perceptions were
   collected in 3 learning stages during the 18 weeks. The experimental
   results reveal positive effects of the online community-based flipped
   instruction over the conventional video-based instruction. That is,
   first, the online community-based flipped instruction using mobile
   devices can enhance students' English oral performance. Moreover, it was
   found that the high improvers had a significantly higher frequency of
   online participation, as well as more interactive behaviors and greater
   satisfaction with the flipped classroom than the low improvers. These
   results imply that the online community flipped classroom could not only
   provide learning materials and out-of-class learning for students, but
   could also help them become more responsible and autonomous in their
   learning and communication. These findings could be valuable references
   for those who intend to conduct effective flipped classrooms with an
   online community to facilitate students' before-class learning
   participation and to improve their in-class learning performance.},

Abstract = {Background: Symptom assessment is difficult to understand and be
   retained by second-year bachelor's nursing students. A flipped classroom
   combined with scenario simulation (FCSS) is a new potential teaching
   model. This study compares the teaching effect and knowledge retention
   between the FCSS approach and the traditional flipped classroom (FC)
   approach. Method: Second-year bachelor's nursing students were selected
   as research participants. One group (n = 59) adopted an FCSS approach,
   whereas the other group (n = 68) adopted an FC approach. We evaluated
   student mastery and retention of knowledge through two tests: one before
   the next class, the other after 2 months. Results: Regarding knowledge
   mastery, the FC group had a higher score than the FCSS group both in
   total score (6629 +/- 1527 versus 59.42 +/- 10.76) and group learning
   score (46.06 +/- 13.25 versus 38.47 +/- 8.22) in the first test (p <
   .05). The retention of knowledge in the FCSS group was better than that
   in the FC group (p < .001), represented by the variable of test score
   difference before and after 2 months. Conclusion: When teaching
   symptomatology, FCSS is helpful to enhance self-learning and improve
   student long-term memory.},

Abstract = {The current study aimed at investigating the impact of Flipped Classroom
   Strategy by using E-Learning Systems (Blackboard) based on Critical
   Thinking Skills of the acquisition of fresh female students of the
   derivative concept of Calculus. To conduct this study, the researchers
   followed the explanatory sequential mixed-methods by dividing randomly
   the 54 fresh female students from the University of Bisha into two equal
   groups: the experimental group and the control group. The selection was
   based on their achievement in First Exam. To measure students'
   acquisition of the derivative concept, the researchers relied on a
   post-test, and semi-structured interview with some learners. The
   analysis of the obtained data showed that teaching Calculus using
   Flipped Classroom Strategy that based on Critical Thinking Skills is
   better than the traditional teaching methodology in the acquisition
   derivative concept. In fact, the interviews show that the fresh female
   students in the experimental group preferred the new strategy, and said
   that it makes learning mathematics interesting and easier.},

Abstract = {Receiving library instruction is essential for first-year students. In
   many colleges and universities, students enroll in an orientation-type
   class and receive library instruction. However, at William Paterson
   University, students taking this class do not have a research-based
   assignment - a challenge for librarians in making the content meaningful
   to students. To remedy this situation, the librarians implemented the
   flipped classroom in which students watched instructional videos prior
   to their library class and participated in active learning activities in
   class. This method proved to be an engaging way for students to learn
   information literacy skills, even in the absence of a graded research
   assignment.},

Abstract = {Along with technology advancements, the Malaysian education system needs
   to be transformed from a traditional system to an environment that is
   technology-based. In the Malaysian context, English is considered a
   second language to be acquired, thus barely practiced by students
   outside classroom or in daily life. Using Gagne's theory, this study
   aims to identify the teaching and learning (T\&L) processes carried out
   when using a flipped classroom (FC) approach. Findings show that
   students have positive responses toward the T\&L processes using a FC
   approach. Three themes emerged during the interview process - children's
   learning, video lectures and learning guidance. Thus, the contributions
   of the paper are to encourage the future English kindergarten teachers
   to implement FC in their T\&L practices.},

Title = {Effectiveness of flipped classroom as a teaching-learning method among
   undergraduate medical students - An interventional study},
Journal = {JOURNAL OF EDUCATION AND HEALTH PROMOTION},

Abstract = {BACKGROUND: Attempts to put the available teaching-learning time to
   better use and address the needs of students by increasing active
   involvement led to the evolution of the flipped classroom (FC). It
   involves providing study resources for students to use outside the class
   so that class time is freed up for instructional activities. This study
   was done to assess the effectiveness of flipped classroom activity as a
   teaching-learning method. MATERIALS AND METHODS: In this interventional
   study, 98 students were divided into two batches of flipped class and
   conventional small group teaching (SGT). An online Google group was
   created for the batch of FC. Brief introduction and prerecorded videos
   related to the assigned topic were posted in the Google group.
   Discussion was carried out in the form of solving cases and
   problem-solving exercises. Pretest and posttest were conducted at each
   session, and an end of module test was conducted for both the groups.
   RESULTS: There was a significant difference between the pre- and
   posttest scores and also the mean scores of summative test between two
   groups (P < 0.001). The perception of the students regarding FC was also
   evaluated. Eighty-two percent strongly agreed that FC was more engaging
   and interesting in comparison to traditional class. Seventy-six percent
   strongly agreed that more such classes should be conducted in the
   future. CONCLUSION: Flipped classroom improved the student performance
   and learning experience effectively as compared to conventional SGT, and
   students' response was also largely positive.},

Abstract = {Engineering courses typically follow a similar framework for content
   delivery: preread, lecture, and homework. Innovations are starting to be
   embraced that increase engagement, student learning, and success. One
   technique that is being experimented with is the use of the flipped
   classroom. In the flipped classroom model, students watch videos of the
   lectures and spend class time working on active learning activities. In
   this study, the flipped model was applied to a junior level civil
   engineering course, Structural Analysis, with the goal of increasing
   student learning and success. A statistical analysis of the attainment
   of the student learning objectives (i.e., student learning) determined
   mixed results. Of the seven learning objectives for the course: four
   increased, two decreased, and one decreased less than one percent. The
   study found that the flipped model had a positive effect on student
   success. There was a 7.9\% increase in students who earned a C grade or
   better in the course.},

Abstract = {By using unified modeling language (UML), the researchers design a
   cloud-based video discussion platform, named Flipnote, for students to
   ask questions at any point in an instructional video. Based on the
   digital learning theory of connectivism, knowledge is generated by mass
   discussion and experience sharing via a social network. The purpose of
   this study is to administer a pilot study to explore students'
   experience and outcome of using Flipnote. The results demonstrate that
   the four dimensions (e.g., diversity, openness, interactivity, and
   autonomy) of the connectivism model play important roles for the first
   half of the flipped class, which is the preview at home. However, more
   empirical research and data are needed to validate the parts played by
   cognitivism and constructivism in the flipped classroom.},

Abstract = {The use of recorded video in medical education is increasing. Video
   material may be assigned before scheduled sessions to create a flipped
   classroom. Here, the instructor may lead a session that is organized for
   discussion, interpretation, and reflection of the previewed content. We
   established conditions that lead to increased student participation and
   engagement with prerecorded content for a medical genetics section in a
   first-year medical school basic sciences integrated course. Preliminary
   analysis of an asynchronous video-based pre-professional program
   directed the design of video material to support a first semester
   medical genetics course. We compared student participation in, and
   opinion of, a flipped-classroom session based on written vs. video
   presentation of material. Student opinion was surveyed with audience
   response devices (clickers). Shorter videos that were created
   specifically for the course were preferred by students compared to
   recordings of previously delivered lectures. Students preferred videos
   to assigned reading material and consistent scheduling throughout the
   teaching semester increased student participation. Presentation of
   medical school content with previously recorded video material can be a
   useful teaching tool if properly implemented.},

Title = {Teaching orthodontic emergencies using the ``flipped classroom{''}
   method of teaching-A mixed methods RCT},
Journal = {EUROPEAN JOURNAL OF DENTAL EDUCATION},
Year = {2020},

Abstract = {Introduction In the United Kingdom, the General Dental Council requires
   newly graduated dentists to be competent in managing orthodontic
   emergencies. Undergraduate students typically receive limited exposure
   to orthodontics, with teaching primarily delivered via conventional
   lectures. Flipped teaching involves knowledge being acquired in
   students' own time, with class time focussing on construction of
   meaning. Methods A total of 61 undergraduate dental students were
   randomised into either a flipped or a conventional group. The
   conventional group (n = 30) attended a lecture describing the management
   of six common emergencies. The flipped group (n = 31) were given access
   to six videos via a virtual learning environment and later completed
   practical tasks related to the material. Both groups completed a single
   best answer assessment. Perceptions of flipped classroom teaching were
   explored via focus groups. Results For questions on orthodontic
   emergencies, the conventional group had a mean examination result of
   70.5\% (SD 8.0\%) compared with the flipped group of 72.8\% (SD 12.9\%).
   There was no significant difference between the groups (P = .532). For
   regular orthodontic questions, the conventional group had a mean
   examination result of 64.8\% (SD: 19.9\%) compared with 78.3\% (SD:
   21.7\%). There was no significant difference between the groups (P =
   .083). Thematic analysis identified the following themes: ways in which
   videos encourages more effective learning, improved engagement,
   awareness of learning needs and proposed teaching/curriculum changes.
   The overarching theoretical perspective was facilitating an experiential
   learning cycle using flipped classroom teaching. Conclusions In the
   context of this investigation, the flipped classroom method of teaching
   resulted in comparable examination performance and improved levels of
   satisfaction.},

Abstract = {With the arrival of the Internet and information and communication
   technologies (ICTs), today's society has driven many changes in which
   the digital channel is one of the main information consumption channels
   for young university students. Due to the turbulent landscape full of
   fake news and confusing information we have entered, there is a need to
   promote information literacy among quality students. To this end, the
   use of innovative strategies and methods such as Flipped Classroom can
   be a novel alternative to receive this content. Based on these ideas,
   the objective of this work was framed in the methodological design
   corresponding to the systematic review. Thus, empirical work was
   compiled to put into practice the Flipped Classroom methodology and to
   promote informational teaching from different knowledge disciplines at
   the university level. The results showed that the application of the
   methodology is multivariate, and that it can be administered to students
   in various ways (video-tutorials, animated videos, training modules,
   etc.) depending on the creativity of the teacher. Likewise, the results
   compiled in the review turn towards the improvement of the students'
   informational skills, as well as the increase in diverse personal and
   academic variables.},

Abstract = {Background A flipped classroom with team-based learning is a blended
   educational strategy that guides active learning inside and outside the
   classroom. This study aimed to verify the effects of this innovative
   blended educational strategy on knowledge, problem-solving ability, and
   learning satisfaction of undergraduate nursing students undergoing
   public healthcare education. Methods The subjects were undergraduate
   nursing students enrolled in H University in South Korea. The experiment
   was conducted over a period of 8 weeks in the public healthcare course.
   Two groups, blended learning (A flipped classroom with team-based
   learning) which was the experimental group and traditional lecture-based
   classroom group, the control group, were assessed. In the blended
   learning group, the students had pre-class, in-class (including
   team-based learning elements), and post-class learning elements. The two
   groups were compared on the following learning outcomes: knowledge,
   problem-solving ability, and learning satisfaction. Results Results
   showed that the blended learning instructional methods, in comparison
   with traditional lectures, enhanced the students' knowledge,
   problem-solving ability, and learning satisfaction in the public
   healthcare course. Conclusions This study supports the feasibility of
   the flipped classroom with team-based learning as a blended learning
   strategy, able to produce improvements in nursing students' learning
   outcomes. Blended learning approaches may be an effective alternative to
   conventional approaches in nursing education.},

Abstract = {Since the age of the Internet was coming, the smart teaching tool Rain
   Classroom provides new research ideas and directions for education
   reform. In this paper, the researchers analyzed the characteristics of
   Rain Classroom, studied the problems in flipped classroom teaching,
   designed a new flipped classroom teaching mode based on Rain Classroom,
   and practiced the new mode in a course on computer-aided landscape
   design. Significant academic differences were shown according to
   questionnaire surveys of students who experienced Rain Classroom
   learning compared with a control group learning through traditional
   lecture-based learning methods. Results suggest that a comparable group
   of graduate students who participated in the flipped class based on Rain
   Classroom scored significantly higher (p = .041 < .05) on the
   ``computer-aided landscape design{''} by an average of >3 percentage
   points than that of the control group. According to survey data,
   students learned more from the Rain Class than from a traditional
   lecture format, and the class also promoted teamwork skills. Our results
   show learning in the Rain Classroom can improve the students' learning
   interest, stimulate students' learning initiative, and promote better
   learning.},

Title = {Effectiveness of the flipped classroom model in university education: a
   synthesis of the best evidence},

Abstract = {This paper explores the historical origin of the flipped classroom (FC)
   model and synthesizes the literature on the FC effectiveness in
   incorporating more active learning and creating a student-centred
   educational environment in Higher Education (HE). To this end, the
   literature on the FC and other pioneering methodologies has been
   reviewed, paying special attention to the impacts of the FC on student
   involvement and academic performance. The FC model is based on different
   methodological approaches-applied in university teaching since the
   1990s- that encourage student preparation before classes: team-based
   learning, peer instruction and just-in-time teaching, where the teacher
   sends the information to his or her students through electronic means.
   This allows more class time to be devoted to active learning and
   formative assessment. The FC model became popular in secondary education
   with the use of videos to convey information to students. Recent
   research shows positive effects of the flipped classroom on multiple
   elements of the educational process. First, FC increases the motivation
   and involvement of students in activities outside and inside the
   classroom. Second, it improves overall comprehension and retention of
   the subjects taught, which results in an improvement in performance and
   a reduction in the failure rate. Third, it improves the development of
   competences and skills, and finally it increases the satisfaction of the
   students and teachers who put it into practice. These positive effects
   have been confirmed in many disciplines and geographical areas.
   In addition, the flipped classroom model creates opportunities for
   students to interact earlier and more sustainably with instructional
   materials, improving their readiness to apply their understanding to
   classroom activities. Thus, students with a higher level of completion
   of preparatory tasks are those who obtain higher performance in the FC.},

Abstract = {Background and Objective: The Flipped Classroom (FC) approach has become
   increasingly predominant and popular in medical education. This study
   aimed to explore the usefulness and the scope of FC based on medical
   students' experience, with their adaptation challenges.
   Methods: The present study was a mixed-method accomplished during the
   academic years 2019-20, involving fourth-year students at the College of
   Medicine in Riyadh, Saudi Arabia. A self-administered questionnaire was
   used to seek their first experience and opinion of the FC.
   Results: A total of 234 questionnaires were distributed to the students,
   and 214 students completed the survey (response rate of 91.45\%). Out of
   this total, 68.2 \% were males and 31.8\% were females. Most of the
   students agreed 156 (72.9\%) that the flipped classroom was more
   engaging than the traditional lecture, among them 100 (68.5\%) males and
   56 (82.3) females agreed. Almost similar to 79\% of students liked FC as
   it enabled them knowing the material in advance, and the class time was
   spent clarifying the facts and principles with active interaction, as
   commented during focus group discussion ``More chance for discussing
   with the doctors, and I got the chance to answer{''} (St. 6).
   Conclusion: The results showed that the students like the FC more than
   the conventional classroom. Suggestions were given by students to
   improve the active learning sessions within the FC modality.},

Abstract = {In this study, a flipped classroom strategy was integrated into a
   comparative experiment to report on the performance of classical Chinese
   learning in two learning scenarios, using both game-based and animated
   story materials or only animated story materials as pre-course preview
   supports. A total of 75 senior high school students participated in the
   experiment. Overall, the findings showed that integrating e-learning
   materials with physical activities fostered flipped classroom learning,
   and learners had a deep impression of the targeted classical Chinese.
   The use of the game-based learning materials for preview triggered the
   students, especially the low-achievement students, to become active
   learners. It was found that the game-based learning materials helped the
   students to have a whole view of the article quickly, so it would be
   beneficial to provide learners with game-based learning materials at the
   beginning of introducing new classical Chinese units to arouse their
   learning motivation. Meanwhile, the animated-story materials were
   helpful for enhancing learners' concepts of important classical Chinese
   sentences and wording, and could be provided to learners according to
   the schedule of the course. The issues of how to run a flipped classroom
   with e-learning materials and further research directions are also
   discussed.},

Abstract = {Introduction: Increasingly, emerging technologies are expanding
   instructional possibilities, with new methods being adopted to improve
   knowledge acquisition and retention. Within medical education, many new
   techniques have been employed in the undergraduate setting, with less
   utilization thus far in the continuing medical education (CME) sphere.
   This paper discusses the use of a new method for CME-the ``flipped
   classroom,{''} widely used in undergraduate medical education. This
   method engages learners by providing content before the live ({''}in
   class{''}) session that aids in preparation and fosters in-class
   engagement.
   Methods: A flipped classroom method was employed using an online
   image-rich case-based module and quiz prior to a live CME session at a
   national nuclear medicine meeting. The preparatory material provided a
   springboard for in-depth discussion at the live session-a case-based
   activity utilizing audience response technology. Study participants
   completed a survey regarding their initial experience with this new
   instructional method. In addition, focus group interviews were conducted
   with session attendees who had or had not completed the presession
   material; transcripts were qualitatively analyzed.
   Results: Quantitative survey data (completed by two-thirds of the
   session attendees) suggested that the flipped method was highly valuable
   and met attendee educational objectives. Analysis of focus group data
   yielded six themes broadly related to two categories-benefits of the
   flipped method for CME and programmatic considerations for successfully
   implementing the flipped method in CME.
   Discussion: Data from this study have proven encouraging and support
   further investigations around the incorporation of this innovative
   teaching method into CME for nuclear imaging specialists.},

Abstract = {The purpose of this study is to define the international students' use
   of flipped classroom and its effect on their academic performance,
   participation levels, learning attitudes and academic success during
   their foreign language learning. The participants were 2 lecturers and
   17 international students from the Preparatory School of Near East
   University in the academic year of 2017-2018 fall semester. This study
   is based on qualitative and descriptive research.
   As a result, it has been introduced that flip lessons were more useful
   instructional designs than non-flip lessons. The findings indicate that
   the students who use Edmodo to follow the flip class achieve better
   learning outcomes and promote better attitudes toward their learning
   experiences.},

Journal = {JOURNAL OF RESEARCH ON TECHNOLOGY IN EDUCATION},
Abstract = {The flipped classroom approach has been extensively adopted in STEM
   disciplines, while little empirical evidence has been found in language
   teaching and learning, especially in the English for Specific Purposes
   (ESP) context. This quasi-experimental study aimed to explore how the
   flipped classroom approach affected non-English majors' self-efficacy,
   study process, and learning performance in English learning. An 18-week
   semester-long flipped approach with pre-class materials and in-class
   interactive activities was implemented in a university ESP class in
   Taiwan. The results showed that the experimental group attained
   significantly higher self-efficacy, and outperformed the control group
   on the examinations. Moreover, the flipped approach promoted learners'
   higher-level skills and enabled them to scrutinize new ideas critically
   and connect them to their existing cognitive structures, and make
   numerous associations between ideas.},

Abstract = {Objectives: Skill competence is essential for nursing students and
   flipped-classroom teaching has become increasingly popular in China's
   nursing education. However, no studies have yet specifically examined
   the effect of a flipped classroom versus a traditional classroom on
   their skill competence.
   Design: A systematic review and meta-analysis of randomised controlled
   trials.
   Data sources: The China National Knowledge Infrastructure, Wanfang Data,
   VIP, Superstar, PubMed, and Web of Science databases were searched from
   their inception until 9 June 2018.
   Review methods: We screened the studies according to inclusion and
   exclusion criteria, extracted the data, and assessed the quality. Then,
   a meta-analysis was conducted.
   Results: Twenty-two studies were eligible after reviewing 484 citations.
   The flipped classroom increased the students' skills score compared with
   the traditional teaching method (standardised mean difference = 1.79,
   95\% confidence interval: 1.32-2.27, p = 0.000). Additionally, it
   improved the cooperative spirit and sense of teamwork (effect size =
   1.60, 95\% confidence interval: 1.15-2.06), practical ability (effect
   size = 1.47, 95\% confidence interval: 0.93-2.01), enjoyment of the
   course (effect size = 1.39, 95\% confidence interval: 0.81-1.97),
   expression and communication (effect size = 1.41, 95\% confidence
   interval: 0.69-2.12), the curriculum's effects (effect size = 1.32, 95\%
   confidence interval: 1.00-1.64), interest in participation (effect size
   = 1.58, 95\% confidence interval: 1.28-1.87), ability to think and
   analyse problems (effect size = 1.62, 95\% confidence interval:
   1.24-2.00), and resolution and resilience (effect size = 1.62, 95\%
   confidence interval: 1.29-1.94).
   Conclusions: The results suggest that the flipped classroom is more
   effective for the nursing students' skill competence than traditional
   teaching in China. However, due to heterogeneity and bias risk, a large
   sample and high-quality studies are needed in future to confirm its
   effectiveness.},

Abstract = {This study investigated the impact of the flipped classroom on grade six
   students' academic achievements and perceptions in science class.
   Participants (n = 39) were assigned to a control group (using
   traditional instruction) or an experimental group (using flipped
   instruction). Data analysis was done using Statistical Package for the
   Social Sciences (SPSS). Pre-test scores of both groups were compared by
   using independent t-test. The obtained ``t{''} value of 1.22 was found
   to be insignificant at p=0.229 (> 0.05) which revealed no significant
   difference between these groups at the beginning. After three weeks,
   their post-test scores in science were again compared to examine the
   impact of different instructional interventions. The obtained ``t{''}
   value of both groups' post-test score comparison was 2.646 which was
   found to be significant at p=0.012 (< 0.05). Likert Scale Questionnaire
   was also employed to explore if students had valued the experimental
   intervention. It was revealed that the students were highly satisfied
   with the flipped classroom. This confirmed the difference between the
   control and experimental groups. Mean scores of flipped and traditional
   instruction groups further assured that flipped instruction had an
   impact on students' learning performance and perceptions.},

Abstract = {The flipped classroom (FC) is a novel teaching mode combining
   traditional classroom and computer network technology. This paper
   attempts to design a FC-based education system for college English
   teaching, which is critical to the quality of English teaching in
   colleges. In our research, a college English education system is
   established based on SQL server and FC. The architecture and functional
   modules of the system were discussed in details. Specifically, the
   system architecture was created based on the browser/server (B/S)
   structure, the data management was realized by SQL server 2008, and the
   system functions were designed and achieved by JavaServer Pages (JSP).
   The proposed system was tested in an actual application. The results
   confirm that the system can meet the teaching demand, arouse the
   students' interest in learning and improve the effect of English
   teaching.},

Title = {Higher education dominance and siloed knowledge: a systematic review of
   flipped classroom research},
Journal = {INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF EDUCATIONAL TECHNOLOGY IN HIGHER EDUCATION},
Year = {2018},
Volume = {15},
Month = {MAY 24},
Abstract = {This structured review examined (academic) publications on flipped or
   inverted classrooms based on all Scopus database (n = 530) references
   available until mid-June 2016. The flipped or inverted classroom
   approach has gained widespread attention during the latest decade and is
   based on the idea of improving student learning by prepared self-studies
   via technology-based resources ('flips') followed by high-quality,
   in-class teaching and learning activities. However, only a few attempts
   have been made to review the knowledge of the field of interest more
   systematically. This article seeks to address this problem and
   investigates what constitutes the research on flipped classrooms and, in
   particular, to examine the knowledge contributions with the field so far
   in relation to the wider research topic of educational technology. This
   review found that the current state of flipped classrooms as a field of
   interest is growing fast, with a slight conference preference and a
   focus on higher education and STEM (science, technology, engineering and
   math) area contributions, with the US as the predominant geographical
   context. It is concluded that studies on flipped classrooms are
   dominated by studies in higher education sector and are relatively local
   in character. The research tends not to interact beyond the two clusters
   of general education/educational technology and subject-specific areas.
   This implies that knowledge contributions related to the flipped
   classroom approach are relatively siloed and fragmented and have yet to
   stabilise. Academically and socially, the research is quite scattered,
   and only local evidence and experiences are available. The knowledge
   contributions within this field of interest seem to be anecdotal rather
   than systematically researched. To a large extent, the research lacks
   anchoring in, for example, learning theory or instructional design known
   from educational technology traditions and which would have helped much
   of the flipped classroom research to examine aspects of the flipped
   classroom approach more fully.},

Abstract = {The main objective of the present study is to analyse the perceptions of
   Secondary Education Master's Degree students as teachers of Spanish
   language and its literature for native speakers on the future use of the
   flipped classroom. This mixed qualitative and quantitative study was
   carried out under an interpretive paradigm that shares characteristics
   with participatory action research. A non-probabilistic sample was
   selected from the students enrolled in a compulsory module of the
   program (n = 38). The questionnaire was validated and structured in 5
   items and 24 sub-items with open and closed questions. The majority of
   the participants (81.58\%) believe that they will use the flipped
   classroom methodology. On the other hand, lack of training in
   audio-visual production and of experience in their first years of
   teaching were the main reasons given by those who affirm that they will
   not use this methodology with their students. The proposal of flipped
   classrooms aroused in the participants a greater conviction of the
   suitability of its use, as well as a greater awareness of their own
   limitations regarding this method.},

Abstract = {The aim of this study is to determine the opinions of teacher candidate
   students regarding the application and their attitudes towards coding by
   conducting a Project Development course with the gamification supported
   flipped classroom approach during the coding period. Quantitative and
   qualitative methods were used together in this study, which aims to
   determine the attitudes and opinions of students regarding coding in a
   gamification supported flipped classrooms over a period of 14 weeks. In
   the qualitative dimension of the study, pre-test and post-test were
   applied as attitude measures to assess the students' attitudes towards
   coding. Furthermore, in the quantitative dimension, semi-structured
   interview forms and interviews were held in order to obtain more
   in-depth information. This study was conducted with 35 classroom
   students who were taking the Project Development course in Computer and
   Instruction Technology Teaching Departments at Near East University, of
   whom 3 were female and 32 were male. The results show that the vast
   majority of teacher candidates were satisfied with the activities
   implemented through the gamification supported flipped classroom and
   there were all increases in their motivation and in-class competition.},

Abstract = {This research investigates the effect of structured computer-assisted
   collaborative concept mapping (SCACCM) on student learning performance
   and motivation when it is used as an inclass auxiliary tool for flipped
   classroom teaching (FCT). This study adopts a quasi-experimental design.
   The teaching experiment is 3 h per week for 6 weeks, 114 students from a
   private university's hospitality management department in Taiwan. The
   experiment results show FCT strategy is helpful for enhancing students'
   learning motivation and academic achievements; using SCACCM as an
   auxiliary strategy for FCT is more effective in enhancing student
   learning motivation and achievements compared to a traditional exercise
   and discussion strategy.},

Abstract = {Teaching-learning processes in university degrees, and especially
   graduate degrees, are evolving towards a digital contents improvement
   and the use of learning platforms and academic management. In this
   sense, the ``flipped classroom{''} lies in turning the traditional
   lessons in order to make students the active protagonists of their own
   learning. In the subject called Contemporary Trends in Education studied
   on the second year of the Primary Education Teacher Degree, this
   methodology has been implemented. The objective of this work was to
   experience this subject and assess the degree of student satisfaction in
   this methodology. In order to do this, the questionnaire about student
   perceptions regarding the flipped classroom was used (Gilboy et al.,
   2015). The results demonstrate that students prefer to participate in
   class through active and group work rather than in a traditional class.
   The application of this educational model promotes a better exploitation
   of time in the classroom, the use of Information and Communication
   Technologies and collaboration between students, motivation and focus on
   students as the protagonists of their own learning.},

Abstract = {Taking cognizance of challenges of 21st century learning and the
   ubiquitous technologies available, a course applying flipped classroom
   model with a detailed combination of in-class and out-of-class
   activities was utilized to teach an academic writing module. The study
   aimed to (1) find out the effects of flipped classroom model towards
   improving learners' writing achievements and (2) investigate learners'
   attitudes towards this approach. 40 English-major freshmen at the
   Banking University of Ho Chi Minh City, Vietnam participated in the
   study during the second semester of the 2016-2017 academic year. Both
   quantitative and qualitative data were collected to ensure the
   reliability as well as the validity of the results. Analysis of this
   data revealed that this model was beneficial as it not only improved
   learners' performance in the final exam but also brought about positive
   attitudes towards the learning process. Finally, suggestions on how the
   model could be improved and better utilized are also discussed so that
   positive learning outcomes in academic essay writing could be obtain},

Abstract = {The aim of this study is to reveal perceptions of pre-service teachers
   about `LEGO robotic instructional practices,' `augmented reality' and
   `flipped classroom' concepts through metaphors. The study is descriptive
   research that was conducted as a survey model. The study group consists
   of 37 pre-service teachers studying the undergraduate programme of
   Science Teaching, Faculty of Education of a university in the Western
   Black Sea Region in the spring semester of the academic year 2016-2017.
   A form consisting of three open-ended questions was used as a data
   collection tool during the study. The data acquired were analyzed
   through content analysis method. Following the study, 15 different
   metaphors created in relation to the LEGO robotic instructional
   practices concept were categorized as `edutainment tool,' `a
   technological tool' and a `development tool,' while 24 different
   metaphors created in relation to the augmented reality concept were
   categorized as `Perception Of Reality', `A Technological Tool',
   `Change/Transformation Tool' and `Entertainment Tool'. Moreover, 25
   different metaphors created in relation to the flipped classroom concept
   were classified in two categories as a `form of education' and `an
   education shaping tool'. Moreover, almost all of the metaphors created
   were observed to have positive features.},

Abstract = {The research aimed to determine the influence of the flipped classroom
   as a tool for the achievement of autonomous learning in university
   students. The type of study that was used was applied and the
   experimental design of a quasi-experimental sub type. The sample
   consisted of 73 students distributed in 2 groups of which one was the
   control group (37) and the other the experimental group (36), students
   of both sexes, for which an intentional Non-Probabilistic sampling was
   used. In relation to the technique, this was the survey as instruments
   the questionnaire that was applied virtually which went through two
   phases before being applied to the study sample (validity and
   reliability), in relation to the reliability a value was obtained of
   0.864 according to KR20. The pre-test results in relation to autonomous
   learning 38.9\% and 43.2\% of the students in the control group (CG) and
   experimental group (EG) maintain a low level, likewise, 58.3\% and 43,
   2\% present a medium level, for their part, 2.8\% of the control group
   and 13.6\% of the experimental group were at the high level. It was
   concluded that the flipped classroom allows the student to learn
   autonomously, incorporating TIC as an innovative element in the
   transformation of the acquisition of new learning in a responsible
   manner.},

Title = {Understanding Student Behavior in a Flipped Classroom: Interpreting
   Learning Analytics Data in the Veterinary Pre-Clinical Sciences},

Abstract = {The flipped classroom has been increasingly employed as a pedagogical
   strategy in the higher education classroom. This approach commonly
   involves pre-class learning activities that are delivered online through
   learning management systems that collect learning analytics data on
   student access patterns. This study sought to utilize learning analytics
   data to understand student learning behavior in a flipped classroom. The
   data analyzed three key parameters; the number of online study sessions
   for each individual student, the size of the sessions (number of topics
   covered), and the first time they accessed their materials relative to
   the relevant class date. The relationship between these parameters and
   academic performance was also explored. The study revealed patterns of
   student access changed throughout the course period, and most students
   did access their study materials before the relevant classroom session.
   Using k-means clustering as the algorithm, consistent early access to
   learning materials was associated with improved academic performance in
   this context. Insights derived from this study informed iterative
   improvements to the learning design of the course. Similar analyses
   could be applied to other higher education learning contexts as a
   feedback tool for educators seeking to improve the online learning
   experience of their students.},

Abstract = {The emerging trend technologies imply the increase in the new role of
   the future of jobs. Most of them required Computer Science-related
   skills a lot, especially programming. However, there is a skill gap for
   it. Some previous studies showed that many students feel difficulties in
   learning programming. In the last decades, there are many approaches to
   improve student's learning achievement through active learning methods.
   One of those approaches is the Flipped Classroom (FC) method. This study
   presents a systematic literature review of the FC approach in the
   programming course. The aim of this study is to explore the strategy of
   FC implementation in the programming class. A total of 32 papers from
   ACM Digital Library and IEEE Xplore Digital Library are selected for
   this review. We found four types of implementation of FC in programming,
   with the variations of the in-class or out-class activities.},

Abstract = {This paper discusses about the versatility of the flipped classroom
   method, stressing its ability to adapt successfully to a diverse range
   of disciplines of different complexity and nature. The study builds upon
   the analysis of several international and successful experiences, and
   then focuses on a specific case: the implementation of this methodology
   in the first technical subject included in the Architecture degree
   taught at the Polytechnical University of Catalonia, as a mean to
   achieve a better comprehension of contents. The success of this
   experience can be measured through two short-term results: the increased
   interest among students towards the subject and the largest number of
   students passing the exam. In the long-term, with this experience it is
   expected to contribute to decrease the dropout rate (currently, around
   22\%1) among first year students enrolled in the Architecture Degree. In
   March 2020, the covid-19 swept across Spain, disrupting the traditional
   functioning of universities, and requiring an immediate switch from an
   in-person to an online teaching and learning environment. This situation
   has implied the rise of a new approach to the flipped classroom method,
   moving from the conventional b-learning implementation to an imposed
   e-learning one.},

Abstract = {This article presents a classroom experience in which Secondary School
   music students have worked on modern music themes under flipped
   classroom methodology using videos as a fundamental resource for
   instrumental practice. The results of a descriptive analysis show that
   students have a very positive assessment both of the methodology used
   (tasks in class vs explanations of the teacher at home; adaptation to
   the student's rhythm; interest in instrumental practice; better
   knowledge for group work) and of the videos designed (contents similar
   to an expository class; increase of confidence for face-to-face classes;
   motivation of use; duration; quality and independence of students with
   respect to their teacher). Although it is an exploratory study, it can
   be affirmed that the design of videos and their use under an adequate
   methodology can have a positive effect on instrumental practice inside
   and outside the classroom.},

Abstract = {In this work, was used the flipped classroom, an active learning
   methodology (ALM), to study the photochemical step of photosynthesis for
   teaching undergraduate students in Biological Sciences. Initially, was
   presented a lecture on ALM and its importance to the learning process. A
   month later, texts and videos about photosynthesis were made available
   to the students and one week later the subject was discussed by the
   students and teachers. This activity was followed by the dramatization
   of the phenomenon, which was guided by the teachers. The results were
   spontaneously evaluated by the students and revealed the importance of
   AML in the development of complex subjects. In classroom discussion it
   was evident that AML requires a great involvement of the teacher, not
   only to motivate the accomplishment of the activities before class, but
   also in conducting the class activities, discussions and in concluding
   the work.},

Title = {Applying ``First Principles of Instruction{''} as a design theory of the
   flipped classroom: Findings from a collective study of four secondary
   school subjects},
Journal = {COMPUTERS \& EDUCATION},

Volume = {118},

Abstract = {The flipped classroom approach is a type of technology-enhanced pedagogy
   that has grown popular in education settings. An increasing number of
   empirical studies have evaluated this approach, but there is still no
   adequate theoretical framework for guiding the design and implementation
   of flipped classrooms. Furthermore, few such studies have been conducted
   in secondary school contexts, and the effects of flipped classrooms have
   not been adequately compared with those of non-flipped classrooms. This
   study aims to address these research gaps by applying the meta design
   theory ``First Principles of Instruction{''} to design our flipped
   classroom approach. A two-stage study was conducted in two secondary
   schools, involving a total of 382 students and five teacher participants
   from four subject areas, namely mathematics, physics, Chinese language,
   and information and communication technology (ICT). Based on the
   experience of the pilot study (Study 1), we refined our flipped
   classroom model and examined its efficacy through a quasi-experimental
   design in the main study (Study 2). Although the students in the flipped
   ICT course had learning outcomes similar to those of students in the
   non-flipped ICT course, the levels of student achievement in the other
   three courses (i.e., mathematics, physics, and Chinese language) were
   improved after flipping, with a small to medium-sized effects. The
   design, benefits, and challenges of the model are discussed. We conclude
   by making several recommendations for practice, and suggesting ideas for
   further research.},

   Classroom: A Case of a Modern Educational Technology Course},

Abstract = {To analyze how variability changes over time can enhance the
   understanding of how learners' self-efficacy, motivation, and
   satisfaction is controlled and why differences might exist among groups
   of individuals. Therefore, this study compared the effect of variability
   on pre-service teacher students in the flipped classroom approach with a
   course named modern educational technology (MET). In total, 77 students
   in two groups participated in this study. Learners in the experimental
   group received the flipped classroom treatment. Learners in the control
   group received the traditional lecture-centered instructional approach.
   The learning outcomes were evaluated by practice assignment, transfer
   assignment, and student perception survey. The survey includes the
   evaluation of learning satisfaction, self-efficacy, and learning
   motivation. Pre-test and post-test were conducted by the two groups. The
   data analysis results applied analysis of variance (ANOVA) or analysis
   of covariance (ANCOVA) and revealed that the experimental group
   displayed a better learning achievement than the control group. The
   experimental group participants' perception also showed variability
   (i.e., learning satisfaction, self-efficacy, and learning motivation)
   was better than the control group. Considering the overall study
   results, the flipped classroom model can be applied in the pre-service
   teacher students' modern educational technology course.},

Abstract = {Physical education emphasizes learning sports skills, which is why it is
   usually conducted in a face-to-face manner. Instructors focus on
   explaining rules and demonstrating moves, which the learners are
   required to repeat and imitate. Flipped classrooms have become a trend;
   thus, the present study investigated their influence on physical
   education. A mobile application for novice and advanced basketball
   players was developed and tested in a course teaching 3-on-3 basketball
   and various teaching methods were implemented to test for the effects of
   gender differences on learning outcome. The participants were students
   enrolled in the aforementioned course in a university in central Taiwan.
   326 participants were included in the study, of whom 238 were male and
   88 were female. The duration of the experiment was 5 weeks between May
   and June 2017, during which the correctness of moves, maneuverability,
   teamwork, sense of balance, and adaptability of the participants were
   evaluated and graded as their learning outcome. The research team
   observed the participants each week to gather empirical data for
   analysis. The results indicate that a mobile flipped classroom is the
   optimal teaching strategy, followed by projecting teaching; therefore, a
   mobile flipped classroom is the recommended approach to be integrated
   into physical education.},

Abstract = {In K-12 schools, classes are forced to transform online due to the class
   suspension amid the COVID-19 pandemic. Educators began to design
   alternative ways to conduct some meaningful learning activities for
   their students. However, not all subject disciplines could be easily
   transformed online, especially for those requiring much social
   interaction and creation processes. In this article, we explore the
   learning processes through learning Shubailan, a form of music
   folk-talk-singing, with a mobile instrument application called muyu in
   an online flipped classroom among 122 secondary school students in Hong
   Kong. The opportunities can encourage students to learn music theories
   and instruments about Shubailan, and create a Shubailan piece through
   6-lesson music learning. To gain more online face-to-face time for
   collaboration, flipping the online classroom is adopted in this study to
   engage students in lesson preparations via preassigned recorded videos
   and collaborative activities during face-to-face online lessons. In this
   study, a mixed research method was employed with the use of a learning
   satisfaction survey, teachers' observations and semi-structured
   interviews. We found that this strategy could effectively motivate
   students to learn music and improve their music knowledge in Shubailan.
   This article presents evidence of implementing the online flipped
   classroom approach to enhance students' satisfaction and knowledge
   acquisition throughout Shubailan music making processes, and offers
   recommendations for online music educators. Results provide a set of
   innovative pedagogical approaches to teach music in an online
   alternative mode during the difficult times.},

Abstract = {Flipped learning have emerged in the last decade to make students'
   learning more active and to enhance learning performance and students'
   motivation and engagement. These new approaches have been applied to
   different subjects at different educational levels. Specifically, in
   higher education most studies have focused on STEM subjects (see Lundin
   et al., 2018). In this paper, we present an experience about flipped
   classroom in two courses related to business management in a Spanish
   university. Results show that students are very satisfied with the
   experience and with the summative-formative assessment that has been
   used. In addition, students consider that their learning process has
   been better with this new methodology. Certainly, academic results have
   been improved with flipping courses, compared with traditional lectures.
   However, this type of methodology implies several challenges for both
   professors and students (some of them demonstrate resistance) and some
   limitations must also be considered.},

Title = {Examining effects of the flipped classroom approach on motivation,
   learning strategies, urinary system knowledge, and urinary
   catheterization skills of first-year nursing students},
Journal = {JAPAN JOURNAL OF NURSING SCIENCE},
Abstract = {Aim In nursing education, innovative approaches are crucial to enhancing
   students' competence and preparing them to respond to the complex
   healthcare needs of society. The aim of the current study was to compare
   the efficacy of the flipped classroom and traditional educational
   approaches on the acquisition of urinary system knowledge and skill
   level, and on the motivation and learning strategies of first-year
   nursing students. Methods This study was implemented with a single blind
   and randomized controlled design in the nursing department of a
   university's faculty of health sciences between December 2018 and
   December 2019, with 94 first-year undergraduate nursing students (47 in
   the experimental group adopting a flipped classroom approach, 47
   students in the traditional approach control group). The study was
   conducted over pre-test and posttest phases for both groups. Results The
   experimental group had higher mean scores than the controls in intrinsic
   goal orientation, task value, self-efficacy, rehearsal, elaboration, and
   organization and effort regulation, but lower scores in test anxiety (p
   < 0.001). The theoretical and skill exam scores of the experimental
   group were higher than those of the control group (p < 0.001).
   Conclusion The flipped classroom approach was effective for improving
   urinary system knowledge and skill level, and for the motivation and
   learning strategies of nursing students. This innovative education
   approach can be recommended as a student-centered method in nursing
   education for teaching theoretical knowledge and evidence-based
   practices.},

Title = {Using a SPOC-based flipped classroom instructional mode to teach English
   pronunciation},
Journal = {COMPUTER ASSISTED LANGUAGE LEARNING},
Abstract = {As a concept established on MOOC, SPOC has been used by many instructors
   in universities. Although SPOC-based flipped classroom instructional
   modes have been applied in many disciplines including English learning
   in China, no empirical study has tried to disentangle the application of
   the modes in teaching English pronunciation. This study reports the
   application of an instructional mode combining SPOC and flipped
   instruction in teaching English pronunciation for college students
   majoring in English Education. The effectiveness of this mode was
   assessed in terms of students' mastery of knowledge in English
   pronunciation, accuracy of students' pronunciation and students'
   satisfaction to the class. The freshmen enrolled in a university in 2018
   were labeled as the controlled group and those enrolled in 2019 and 2020
   comprised the experimental groups. Results showed that the experimental
   groups significantly outperformed the controlled group in the mastery of
   knowledge and the accuracy of pronunciation. In addition, the
   improvement in students' pronunciation was not as much as that in their
   degree of mastering the knowledge. All students in experimental groups
   indicated a high degree of satisfaction to the teaching mode. These
   results prove that SPOC-based flipped classroom instructional mode not
   only can attain positive perceptions from students but also can be
   helpful for improving students' learning of knowledge in pronunciation
   and correctness of pronunciation. However, more input and practice
   opportunities are still needed to make a better enhancement in students'
   English pronunciation, which can be expected to be achieved by virtual
   simulation systems for English pronunciation training.},

Abstract = {Teachers now have a new teaching model to refer to with the emergence of
   the flipped classroom. The teacher-student interaction is thought to be
   influenced by teaching mode as a key indicator of improving teaching
   efficiency. We develop a research model based on a literature review to
   explain the drawbacks of teacher-student interaction in flipped
   classrooms with oral English instruction. SmartPLS software was used to
   analyze the survey data of 84 students from three classes. Emotional
   resistance has a significant negative impact on the effect of
   teacher-student interaction in the flipped classroom, whereas learning
   autonomy and video content quality have a significant positive impact.
   Our research adds to the body of knowledge in the field of flipped
   classrooms and provides theoretical support for teachers in colleges and
   universities who want to use this teaching method.},

Abstract = {In this action research study, a flipped and non-flipped college-level
   mathematics classroom were compared. Participants in the flipped
   classroom watched video lessons outside of class and engaged in
   classwork problems during class. The non-flipped classroom consisted of
   a lecture then assigned classwork problems during class. Descriptive
   statistics revealed that learners preferred a flipped classroom to a
   non-flipped classroom and that the video lectures helped them learn the
   course material. A one-way ANCOVA on posttest showed no difference
   between learners in the flipped classroom and non-flipped classroom with
   pre-test scores as a covariate. Although independent samples t-test did
   not reveal statistically significant differences on several in-class
   examinations between the two groups, small positive effects showed in
   the flipped classroom students' performance. Course evaluation of the
   two groups showed a small to large-size effect on five items, pertaining
   to this study. Learners in the flipped classroom perceived that the
   video lectures helped them to learn more mathematics compared to
   learners in the non-flipped classroom who did not use video lectures
   (p=.039).},

Title = {Considering mobile device constraints and context-awareness in adaptive
   mobile learning for flipped classroom},

Abstract = {Today, the mobile technologies and Information and Communication
   Technology development opened the door on new methods and pedagogies of
   learning. We are talking here about the mobile learning and the flipped
   classroom approaches. The flipped classroom means that the activities
   that have traditionally taken place inside the classroom now take place
   outside the classroom and vice versa. The mobile learning and as its
   name suggests is done in a mobile and changeable environment by mobile
   learners. Therefore, the context notion plays a significant role in this
   type of learning. Hence, the usefulness of the context-aware mobile
   learning systems. These systems take into account the different context
   dimensions to offer to the learners an adapted learning according to
   their situations. The approach proposed in this paper called Smart
   Enhanced Context-Aware for Flipped Mobile Learning ``SECA-FML{''} aims
   to provide learners with an adapted course content format based on their
   context by taking into account the different context dimensions and
   especially the mobile device context. The latter has a significant
   influence on multimedia content in adaptive mobile learning. The
   contribution was applied in the context of the flipped learning in order
   to manage the heterogeneity of context imposed by this approach. To
   validate our contribution, we have developed an Android mobile
   application. This application has been made available to learners to try
   and exploit it. At the end of the experimentation phase, the learner is
   asked to complete a questionnaire. Based on this questionnaire, we
   measured the reliability and effectiveness of our contribution, as well
   as the satisfaction of the learners towards the latter. The evaluation
   results showed that the use of the context dimensions and specifically
   the device context in adaptive mobile learning is more beneficial for
   learners especially in the flipped classroom.},

Title = {Development of a Screencast-Based Flipped Classroom to Enrich Learning
   and Reduce Faculty Time Requirements in an Animal Welfare Master's
   Degree},
Journal = {JOURNAL OF VETERINARY MEDICAL EDUCATION},
Abstract = {A new distance learning Master of Science (MSc) degree in Animal Welfare
   Science, Ethics and Law was established in 2016 within the Centre for
   Animal Welfare at the University of Winchester, UK. Our program
   recruited students worldwide, with enrollments increasing dramatically
   since its inception in 2016. However, despite rapid growth, our MSc has
   had only one full-time equivalent faculty member.With further projected
   sharp increases in student numbers, significant programmatic change was
   required for the MSc to remain viable. After consultation with our
   students and program team, we decided to transition to a flipped
   classroom teaching model. Piloting a screencast-based flipped classroom
   in one course, our objectives were to provide a more enriched, engaging,
   and effective student learning experience and to increase student
   satisfaction while concurrently saving staff time in future years. We
   aimed to provide a series of enriched screencast videos of short
   (similar to 20-minute) durations, with contents clearly signposted.The
   new teaching model was well received. Within our 2021 program survey,
   100\% of respondents expressed a wish to see our screencast-based
   flipped classroom approach continued, and 71\%-86\% wished to see it
   implemented in various additional courses. This model has greatly
   enriched students' learning experiences, increasing student engagement
   and satisfaction while also freeing staff time to engage in discussion
   fora and additional live sessions. Learning and achievement outcomes
   also appear positive.We plan to steadily integrate this model across
   additional courses, although initial time investment will be
   significant. Hence, this new model will be implemented over several
   semesters.},

Abstract = {Flipped classroom is a student-centered methodology that can help
   engineering students to acquire the cross-curricular skills demanded by
   society. However, its effectiveness relies on the commitment of both
   instructors and students. In particular, this strategy requires students
   to work on a number of proposed activities before face-to-face classes.
   Then, in order to follow the most appropriate path in those classes,
   instructors need a reliable way to know at which degree their students
   worked on those proposed activities, what issues they encountered while
   doing them and which concepts need to be reinforced in class. This paper
   presents a case study of a flipped-classroom undergraduate engineering
   course. By using data-driven learning design and learning analytics
   techniques we show that: (1) by delaying their work on the course
   activities our students actually drove the course towards the
   traditional approach; (2) despite directly asking students at the
   beginning of a face-to-face class might seem to be an appropriate way of
   getting reliable information about their previous work, it may lead
   instructors to erroneous conclusions; (3) our students were strongly
   mark- and deadline-oriented, but even a small grade encouraged them to
   work on the assignments; (4) the gathering and checking of students'
   learning data before the class can help instructors to tailor the lesson
   design; and (5) if students did not work on pre-class activities,
   dedicating a small amount of time of the in-class lesson to explain the
   most difficult concepts can help students to be more efficient with
   their work, at the cost of losing some of the spirit of the flipped
   classroom.},

Abstract = {The educational model is constantly improving and a change of paradigm
   is accepted. The educational process needs a new approach, whereby
   cooperative work is promoted and students are encouraged to take part of
   their classes. The broad aim is to facilitate an adaptation to different
   learning rhythms, with more practical and experimental classes, which
   promote autonomous learning, and hands-on learning. The ``flipped
   classroom{''} model has shown that it can provide for some of these
   needs, This study presents research findings which has been carried out
   at the Degree of Primary Education of the Faculty of Education,
   University of Malaga.
   The defined aim has been to analyse and understand the results of having
   carried out flipped classroom methodology, in two different subjects
   from two different courses, Didactics of Mathematics and Educational
   Information and Communication Technologies. The study is based on a
   triangulation of dates from a qualitative and quantitative analysis to
   get a complete picture of the real situations we analysed from two
   different methodological focuses. The information to analise, was
   obtained from questions, interviews, and surveys.
   The results which have been reached, conclude that students welcomes the
   introduction of this new methodology, because provides them
   participative lessons, providing access to didactic and closer format
   contents, that they can consult when and where they want. This
   methodology is adapted to different learning rhythms and requirements.
   Students consider that they have an efficient use of their in-class
   time, and effective learning, and they recognize their learning has
   improved. Similar results were seen in several other studies, in
   different educational stages.},

   professional literature the experience of a personal teaching initiative
   is going to be introduced, the basis of which was offered by the
   teaching organization method called, Flipped Classroom Model{''}. The
   purpose of this case study is to support non-traditional students in
   active learning. The phases of the case study are preliminary online
   questionnaire about learning from each other - mapping, getting to know
   earlier experience. Satisfaction survey after involvement, testing, the
   results of which were completed by oral, group interviews. The case
   study verified that the more successful the students think the
   collaboration and the collective reflection are with other group
   members, the more satisfied they are with the content of the

Title = {Effect of flipped classroom methodology on the student performance of

Abstract = {Background Physiology is a subject that is considered difficult; it is
   associated with academic failure and causes high levels of stress and
   anxiety in students. Methods This study compared the effectiveness of a
   traditional lecture-based methodology with that of a flipped classroom
   scheme focusing on cooperative ludic learning among gastrointestinal and
   renal physiology students. Two groups were subjected to these two
   different methods to teach gastrointestinal and renal physiology content
   divided into 14 topics. Additionally, two subgroups were identified in
   each group: entrants and repeaters. There were no differences in age or
   gender between the subgroups. Results Levels of self-perceived stress
   (measured by the SISCO scale), biological stress (measured by awakening
   salivary cortisol levels), and anxiety (measured by the Zung scale) were
   high in all of the students; the cortisol levels increased in the
   entrants and some of the scores in SISCO scale increased in the
   repeaters, throughout the study. The self-reported study time was longer
   in the students subjected to the flipped classroom-based method. The
   final exam results were better only in the new students facing the
   flipped methodology, but not in the repeaters, who scored lower on the
   final evaluation. The quantitative and qualitative assessments completed
   by the participants regarding the different aspects of the
   flipped-classroom-based methodology were favorable; however, the
   participants believed that traditional lectures should be maintained for
   specific topics. Conclusions A methodology based on flipped teaching was
   an effective strategy to improve academic performance ingastrointestinal
   and renal physiology, but only in new students.},

Title = {English Listening Teaching Model in Flipped Classroom Based on
   Artificial Intelligence Fusion Control Algorithm},
Journal = {MATHEMATICAL PROBLEMS IN ENGINEERING},
Year = {2021},

Abstract = {In our contemporary life, various information technologies are changing
   our lives, and the development of information technology has also
   provided a certain degree of convenience for the development of
   education. Now, every country attaches great importance to the
   development of the informatization of education. This article aims to
   study how to apply artificial intelligence content and control
   algorithms to the English listening mode of a flipped classroom. The
   main purpose of the article is how to make the flipped classroom more
   intelligent, enrich the content of the classroom, and devote itself to
   improving children's learning efficiency. This article proposes the
   application of the PSO algorithm in the flipped classroom to help
   students learn more intelligently and conveniently in this mode of
   teaching. They can help children improve their academic performance
   faster and learn more efficiently. The experimental results of this
   article show that nearly 65.63\% of students are familiar with the
   teaching method of using animation video to train English listening, and
   nearly 70\% of students are very willing to use this teaching method to
   learn; using more artificial intelligence fusion control algorithms for
   us, this teaching mode is used for some simplification and assistance.
   The average test score of the experimental class (82.95 points) is
   higher than the posttest score of the control class (79.9 points), the
   excellence rate of the experimental class is 38\%, the pass rate is
   100\%, and the control class has an excellent rate of 32\% in the
   posttest score. The passing rate was 86.7\%. Further analysis shows
   that, in the posttest scores of the experimental class, the excellent
   rate and the passing rate have increased, respectively. After the test,
   the scores of the students in the experimental class have improved
   greatly compared with the control class. The overall performance of the
   students has improved significantly.},

Journal = {JOURNAL OF NUTRITION EDUCATION AND BEHAVIOR},
Year = {2020},
Volume = {52},

Pages = {394-400},
Month = {APR},
Abstract = {Objective: To explore undergraduate students self-reported learning
   experience in a foundation nutrition education course/unit delivered
   using a flipped classroom approach (FCA), which requires students to
   complete independent learning before and after interactive in-class
   learning experiences.
   Methods: A descriptive cohort study design used selected items from a
   self-report flipped classroom student engagement questionnaire to assess
   Australian undergraduate student (n = 105) engagement in the course/unit
   and compared with nonflipped courses, preference for FCA, academic
   achievement, learning behaviors for 3 FCA learning phases, and more or
   less engaging aspects of the course/unit.
   Results: Most (66.5\%) students were engaged or very engaged, with half
   (55\%) more engaged in this course/unit compared with other nonflipped
   courses/units with a preference for the FCA (53\%). Almost half of the
   students agreed the FCA improved their academic performance (grade)
   (45\%) and other academic skills (ie, teamwork) (48.5\%). Most student
   comments related to the value of participate phase activities.
   Conclusions and Implications: The FCA engaged most students in learning
   and is an emerging learning and teaching approach appropriate for
   undergraduate nutrition dietetic education.},

Abstract = {In this work an experience of didactic intervention is exposed, which
   was implemented to face what the new virtual scenario, caused by the
   health emergency, imposes on the continuity of the educational process.
   The didactic intervention consists of the application of the inverted
   classroom model or flipped classroom in the course of Introduction to
   Civil Law, during the second semester of the year 2020. The development
   of this work consists of three parts: the first addresses the
   antecedents that require the modification of the educational process and
   the change of context or scenario that education faces; secondly, the
   main aspects are identified, together with the advantages of the flipped
   class method in higher education; while the third part describes the
   didactic intervention carried out in the first year course, in addition
   to exposing the results obtained in the application of a satisfaction
   survey carried out on the students who participated in the experience.},

Abstract = {Background: Medical education is evolving to emphasize trainee
   engagement. The impact of a flipped classroom curriculum and surgical
   simulation on dermatology resident education has not been evaluated.
   Objective: To assess the impact of video education and surgical
   simulation on dermatology resident procedural skills.
   Methods: We created a curriculum on foundational surgical skills for 31
   first- and second-year dermatology residents at 3 institutions. The
   flipped classroom approach replaces traditional in-person lectures with
   at-home viewing of instructional videos. After this self-directed
   learning, trainees had 3 hands-on sessions using simulated skin models.
   The Objective Structured Assessment of Technical Skills (OSATS)
   instrument was used to assess residents performing a simulated
   elliptical excision with intermediate repair before and after the
   curriculum. Residents completed precurriculum and postcurriculum surveys
   evaluating operative confidence and perceived value of the curriculum.
   Results: Residents' total OSATS score increased from a median of 27
   (interquartile range, 22-38.5) before the curriculum to 46
   (interquartile range, 39.5-51.5) after the curriculum (P < .001).
   Self-reported confidence in surgical performance significantly improved,
   and residents were highly satisfied.
   Limitations: Limitations include the small sample size and potential
   influence from concurrent learning on surgical rotations.
   Conclusions: Video education and simulation are effective for improving
   dermatology residents' procedural skills. We hope to serve as a template
   for other institutions and nondermatology trainees hoping to improve
   procedural skills.},

Abstract = {New teaching methods are designed and implemented to ensure student
   success and application of knowledge. One of these designs is the
   flipped classroom. Nursing programs are also integrating technology,
   including simulation, into nursing education in order to enhance student
   engagement. Although several research studies support flipped classroom
   methodology, no studies have compared traditional and flipped classroom
   teaching methods, as well as the use of a technology-enhanced classroom,
   in a baccalaureate nursing health assessment course. The purpose of this
   study was to compare learning outcomes and student satisfaction in an
   undergraduate health assessment course across three teaching methods:
   traditional lecture, flipped classroom, and a technology-enhanced
   interactive flipped classroom. All three methods incorporated virtual
   patient simulation. Using a quasi-experimental design, formative and
   summative assignment grades were compared. Student course evaluations
   were compared to assess satisfaction with each teaching method.
   Significant differences in mean grades were found in 12 of the 23
   assignments. The technology-enhanced interactive flipped classroom
   section outperformed the traditional and flipped classroom sections on
   most of these assessments. Only one difference was noted in student
   satisfaction. The results showed that a technology-enhanced interactive
   flipped classroom design supported student learning. A longitudinal
   analysis of student performance is recommended.},

Title = {Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) Learning Online: A Flipped Classroom
   Based on Micro-Learning Combined with Case-Based Learning in
   Undergraduate Medical Students},
Journal = {ADVANCES IN MEDICAL EDUCATION AND PRACTICE},
Year = {2021},

Abstract = {Background: During the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic,
   medical colleges in China had to use online teaching. This study
   explored the effect of COVID-19 knowledge learning online in a flipped
   classroom based on micro-learning combined with case-based learning
   (CBL).
   Methods: There were 74 undergraduate medical students who were randomly
   grouped to an observation group and a control group with 37 participants
   in each virtual classroom on the Network Teaching Platform. Students
   learning in the control group utilized face-to-face lecture with
   PowerPoint pre-provided, while students learning in the observation
   group were conducted in a flipped classroom based on micro-learning
   combined with CBL. We compared the effect of both formats of COVID-19
   knowledge learning online and the impact on clinical practice attitude
   in two groups.
   Results: All 74 students (100\%) responded pretest, posttest and
   retention test, and completed the questionnaire online. Both formats
   significantly improved COVID-19 knowledge acquisition at the conclusion
   of online COVID-19 curriculum. Students' knowledge test scores including
   total score and scores of five knowledge dimensions of COVID-19 were
   significantly higher in the observation group than those in the control
   group (P<0.05). Compared with students in the control group, students in
   the observation group performed better in retention test and had a
   significantly more positive clinical practice attitude (P<0.05 in all
   items).
   Conclusion: A flipped classroom based on micro-learning combined with
   CBL showed greater effectiveness in COVID-19 knowledge gain in
   undergraduate medical students and made their attitude toward clinical
   practice more positive.},

Abstract = {Objective: To assess usefulness of flipped style of teaching conducted
   as small-group format in Cardiovascular and Respiration module for
   Year-I undergraduate medical students at Aga Khan University.
   Methods: The study was planned and conducted over a period of eight
   months from March to October 2017 including the time taken for planning,
   mock run, execution followed by analysis and dissemination. It was
   carried out at the Aga Khan University Medical College, Karachi. Pre and
   post test scores of students after flipped class room sessions was
   compared. Moreover, perception of students was assessed on Likert scale
   (0-4) by a pretested validated questionnaire.
   Results: The mean pre-test scores of the students was 4.86 +/- 0.91
   which improved to 6.09 +/- 0.81 (p = 0.021) after attending the flipped
   class session. Students approved that the frame work helped to promote
   their learning motivation and engagement with improvement in
   understanding of the course materials and enhancement of learning during
   Face to Face activity.
   Conclusions: The flipped classroom approach showed promise in teaching
   and learning of `Pathophysiology of Shock' by clinical scenarios in
   small group discussions. Implementation of flipped class room activity
   on a wider scale however needs careful selection of course objectives
   and logistics.},

Title = {Development and validation of a measurement scale to assess nursing
   students' readiness for the flipped classroom in Sri Lanka},
Journal = {JOURNAL OF EDUCATIONAL EVALUATION FOR HEALTH PROFESSIONS},
Year = {2020},
Volume = {17},

Abstract = {Purpose: It aims to develop and validate a scale to measure nursing
   students' readiness to the flipped classroom in Sri Lanka.
   Methods: A literature review provided the theoretical framework for
   developing the Nursing Students' Readiness for Flipped Classroom
   (NSR-FC) questionnaire. Five content experts evaluated the NSR-FC, and
   content validity indices were calculated. Cross-sectional surveys among
   355 undergraduate nursing students from 3 state Sri Lankan universities
   were carried out to assess the psychometric properties of the NSR-FC.
   Principal component analysis (PCA, n = 265), internal consistency
   (through Cronbach's alpha, n = 265), and confirmatory factor analysis
   (CFA, n = 90) were done for construction validity and reliability test.
   Results: There were 37 items included in the NSR-FC for content
   validation and resulting in an average scale content validity index
   (S-CVI/AVE) of 0.94. Two items received item level content validity
   index (ICVI) less than 0.78. The factor structures of the 35 items were
   explored through PCA with orthogonal factor rotation culminating in the
   identification of 5 factors. These factors were classified as technology
   readiness, environmental readiness, personal readiness, pedagogical
   readiness, and interpersonal readiness. The NSR-FC also showed an
   overall acceptable level of internal consistency (Cronbach's alpha 0.9).
   The CFA verified a 4-factor model (excluding the interpersonal readiness
   factor) and 20 items achieved acceptable levels of acceptance
   (SRMR=0.08, RMSEA=0.08, CFI=0.87 and chi(2)/df =1.57).
   Conclusion: The NSR-FC, as a four-factor model, is an acceptable
   measurement scale for nursing students' readiness to the flipped
   classroom in terms of its construct validity and reliability.},

Abstract = {This study reported on a flipped classroom approach used in a Business
   Chinese (BC) course in the UK. The research methods were 36 hours of
   classroom observation, two focused-group interviews (n = 6, 50 minutes
   each), triangulated with students' feedback from National Student Survey
   (NSS). The class observation revealed that the
   Presentation-Practice-Production (P-P-P) model functioned well
   throughout the learning process: the presentation of new learning
   materials was digitalized in the form of PowerPoint in an official
   e-learning platform for students to preview before class. In-class hours
   were used for understanding, analyzing, evaluating, applying, and
   creating. Students analysed the positive and negative elements and
   applied the positive factors in practice. After class, students took
   their peers' constructive feedback into consideration and created their
   own companies. The interview results illustrated that although students
   felt it was more work, they welcomed the flipped structure in that the
   mode of instruction was no longer a one-way flow of information, but in
   a variety of media: audio, video, websites, links, etc., and by setting
   up and running their own companies, students were no longer passive
   learners, instead they made full use of the available resources to
   become active agencies, responsible for their own companies. Students'
   feedback from NSS showed students' positive learning attitudes, as
   flipped classroom enriched their learning experience by practising
   business skills both in and out-of-class, and running their own
   companies inspired them to devote more effort to the learning process.},

Abstract = {The teaching and learning process is highly determined by motivation and
   the learning environment. The motivation and the learning environment,
   within education, both of them depend a lot on the educational
   methodologies that are implemented in educational centers. The objective
   of this work is to compare the motivation and the state of Flow between
   the Flipped Classroom methodological strategy and a traditional
   methodology. For this reason, a quasi-experimental design study was
   carried out, with a selection of the non-probabilistic and intentional
   sample. 103 university students participated in the study, divided into
   an experimental group (Flipped Classroom) and a control group
   (traditional methodology). The motivation and the state of Flow were
   evaluated before the beginning of the lessons related to the subject:
   ``Physical Education Didactics{''} and at the end of it (four months
   later). The 2x2 achievement goal questionnaires (Guan et al., 2006) and
   DREEM (Herrera et al., 2015) were used. To determine if there are
   initial and final differences between the groups, the T-Student test was
   performed on independent samples. To observe intra-group differences
   (pre vs. post-test), a T-Student test was detected for related samples.
   The results found that there are differences between the control group
   and the experimental group in the variables approach/mastery (p <.001),
   teaching (p =.003) and learning (p =.05). With the Flipped Classroom
   methodology, students have higher levels of motivation and Flow status
   than students who teach a traditional methodology.},

Abstract = {OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the effectiveness of a simulation-based flipped
   classroom in gaining the laparoscopic skills in medical students.\&
   para;\& para;DESIGN: An intervention trial.\& para;\& para;SETTING:
   Taipei Medical University Hospital, an academic teaching hospital.\&
   para;\& para;PARTICIPANTS AND METHODS: Fifty-nine medical students
   participating in a 1-hour laparoscopic skill training session were
   randomly assigned to a conventional classroom (n = 29) or a flipped
   classroom approach (n = 30) based on their registered order. At the end
   of the session, instructors assessed participants' performance in
   laparoscopic suturing and intracorporeal knot-tying using the assessment
   checklist based on a modified Objective Structured Assessment of
   Technical Skills tool.\& para;\& para;RESULTS: Students in the flipped
   group completed more numbers of stitches (mean {[}M] = 0.47; standard
   deviation {[}SD] = 0.507) than those in the conventional group (M= 0.10;
   SD = 0.310) (mean difference: 0.37; 95\% CI: 0.114-582; p = 0.002).
   Moreover, students in the flipped group also had higher stitch quality
   scores (M = 7.17; SD = 2.730) than those in the conventional group (M =
   5.14; SD = 1.767) (mean difference = 2.03; 95\% CI: 0.83-3.228; p =
   0.001). Meanwhile, students in the flipped group had higher pass rates
   for the second throw (p < 0.001), third throw (p = 0.002), appropriate
   tissue reapproximation without loosening or strangulation (p < 0.001),
   needle cut from suture under direct visualization (p = 0.004), and
   needle safely removed under direct visualization (p = 0.018) than those
   in the conventional group.\& para;\& para;CONCLUSIONS: Comparing with
   traditional approach, a simulation-based flipped classroom approach may
   improve laparoscopic intracorporeal knot-tying skill acquisition in
   medical students. (C) 2017 Association of Program Directors in Surgery.

Abstract = {Flipped learning environments have found their way into business and
   entrepreneurship education. While most studies have found that flipped
   classrooms can enhance learning effectiveness, the instructors still
   struggle to implement flipped courses effectively. The instructors' and
   learners' low understanding of flipped learning benefits, in-class and
   out-of-class activities, its implementation challenges, and
   troubleshooting strategies are the issues that influence the
   implementation of the flipped classrooms. This article aims to enhance
   the understanding of these issues, especially to those new to the
   flipped classroom approach, by synthesising the current knowledge on the
   approach in business and entrepreneurship education using a systematic
   review approach. Starting from 785 articles, 30 studies on flipped
   classrooms in business and entrepreneurship were selected for the review
   following the guidelines of PRISMA. The study provides an overview of
   the benefits of flipped classrooms and the recommended in-class and
   out-of-class activities. We reviewed the challenges that learners and
   instructors may face in the flipped learning approach. Based on these
   insights, potential mitigation strategies were provided. The study
   contributes to the early-stage flipped classroom literature in business
   and entrepreneurship education by offering a comprehensive overview of
   flipped learning and future research directions.},

Abstract = {Background and purpose: To examine the educational outcomes comparing
   flipped classroom method versus a didactic method with active learning
   in two semesters of a modified team-based learning (TBL) self-care
   pharmacotherapy course and explore student-identified preferences for
   teaching modality.
   Educational activity and setting: Grade performance on readiness
   assurance processes, both individual (iRAP) and team (CRAP), and exam
   questions were compared in two semester-long course offerings.
   Additionally, students were surveyed pre- and post-course.
   Findings: The mean iRAP scores were 81.9\% for the didactic method and
   80.7\% for the flipped method (p = .092). The mean CRAP scores were
   93.6\% for both didactic and flipped methods (p = .979). Mean exam
   performance for content taught using didactic and flipped methods were
   83.3\% and 83.5\%, respectively (p = .730). Pre-course respondents
   indicated the following preferences: didactic (27.7\%), flipped (9\%),
   combination (58.2\%), no preference (5.1\%). Postcourse, 46.8\%
   preferred didactic, 5.7\% preferred flipped, and 47.5\% preferred a
   combination. Respondents perceived the didactic method helped develop
   deeper understanding, stimulated greater interest, and improved
   retention; however, they felt the flipped method improved critical
   thinking and application.
   Summary: There were no statistically significant differences in student
   outcomes comparing teaching methods while student preference for the
   flipped classroom decreased.},

Abstract = {This article studies the effect of the implementation of the flipped
   classroom on verbal interactions in oral production sessions for
   students of the first year of French License in Algeria. The inversion
   consists in carrying out a spatio-temporal rearrangement of learning
   which combines phases of learning in presence and at a distance via the
   use of video clips. With this in mind, we constructed a control group
   with a traditional course and an ``experimental{''} group with reverse
   learning, taking into account Bloom's taxonomic levels. The data
   collected consists of audio recordings transcribed from interactions
   during class sessions. Our approach is essentially comparative in so far
   as we have sought to identify the added value of such a device on
   interactional dynamics within the two groups. The results obtained
   support the idea that the introduction of the reverse device in
   teaching/learning oral production makes learners more active, more
   productive and more motivated during the activity.},

Abstract = {There has been a recent move toward active learning pedagogies in
   veterinary education, with increasing use of a blended approach that
   incorporates both online resources and live classroom sessions. In this
   study, an established veterinary pre-clinical course in introductory
   animal health was transitioned from a traditional didactic lecture
   delivery mode to a flipped classroom approach with core content
   delivered online. This study compared the experiences of two cohorts of
   students who studied the same course in the different formats in
   consecutive years. Online learning resources included short video
   segments and a variety of short problems and activities. Online
   materials were complemented with weekly small-group case-based learning
   classes facilitated by academic staff. A mixed methods evaluation
   strategy was applied using student grades, surveys, and focus groups to
   compare student academic performance, satisfaction, and engagement
   between the two cohorts. The flipped classroom cohort achieved
   significantly higher grades in the written answer section of the final
   examination. Student satisfaction with learning resources was also
   higher in this cohort. However, satisfaction with other aspects of the
   course was largely the same for both cohorts. This study revealed some
   of the challenges associated with achieving adequate student preparation
   for class using online resources. The outcomes of this study have
   implications for veterinary educators considering the design and
   development of new online learning resources.},

Abstract = {In accordance with the progressive knowledge-to-ability transformation
   laws, a hierarchical learning model composed of cognitive layer,
   application layer, and design layer was created and applied to college
   computer teaching. This model was used to facilitate the deep learning
   among students through the association establishment, step-by-step
   understanding, and comprehensive application of new and old knowledge.
   In the teaching design process, the ``5-problem{''} teaching, which
   centered on ``student-problem-activity-resource,{''} was conducted and
   applied to the ``Small Private Online Course (SPOC) + flipped
   classroom.{''} The teaching result was assessed using the proposed
   hierarchical classification method. Results demonstrate that the
   improved teaching model remarkably enhances the ability of noncomputer
   major students to solve the practical problems encountered in their
   specialties by virtue of computational thinking through the data
   analysis of evaluation results and students' survey feedback. The
   students obviously speak more highly of the improved teaching model than
   the traditional blended teaching in the aspects of teaching content
   organization, learning effect, integration degree with the specialty and
   satisfaction. The degree of their participation in the flipped classroom
   reached as high as 90\%.},

   teaching practices in the Faculty of Engineering and Agricultural
   Sciences of the National University of San Luis and its relationship
   with the demands of the work environment, we designed a didactic
   proposal for teaching communicative English for students of the
   engineering careers of the mentioned university. This proposal will be
   carried out with the blended modality, applying the teaching model
   called flipped classroom (Bergmann and Sams, 2012). Such model implies a
   different way in which the teaching and learning processes happen. Thus,
   it basically consists of reversing the traditional order of the events
   that occur inside and outside the class. The objective of this work is
   to socialize the development of the aforementioned project, its main
   results and the academic proposal that resulted from the findings.},

Abstract = {Background: Use of the flipped classroom model is recognized as a
   popular method of instruction. Effective preclass preparation methods
   can create more time for instructors to reinforce application,
   evaluation, and analysis of information using active learning
   strategies. Method: This quasi-experimental study used a convenience
   sample of 42 third-year baccalaureate nursing students. Students were
   randomized into two groups and received either a narrated video
   (vodcast) or guided readings for the preclass preparation. A quiz was
   administered to assess preparation prior to class, and students
   completed a survey following the classroom activities. Results: Students
   preferred media preparation to guided readings. This preference
   translated to higher quiz scores. Positive correlations were noted
   between quiz scores and students' understanding and increased
   confidence. Conclusion: Students' preference for the vodcast translated
   to the perception of an increase in confidence and understanding of the

   using the flipped classroom},
Journal = {TECHNOLOGY PEDAGOGY AND EDUCATION},
Abstract = {The lack of information and communication technology skills among
   teachers is highlighted as being one of the main barriers to increasing
   the use of technology in teaching and learning. This study shows how
   technology used in a flipped classroom can improve learning among
   pre-service teachers, as well as boosting perceptions of their own
   technology skills. The students covered the instructional content before
   class through videos complemented by formative assessment. The data
   resulted in a report that the teacher then used to adapt their lecture,
   as well as defining the questions to be asked using an in-class response
   system. The responses to these questions were then discussed with the
   students. The results show that it is possible to change pre-service
   teachers' perceptions of using technology in the classroom, both as a
   student and as a future teacher.},

Title = {A Problem-Solving Flipped Classroom Module: Developing Problem-solving
   Skills among Culinary Arts Students},
Journal = {JOURNAL OF TECHNICAL EDUCATION AND TRAINING},

Abstract = {Problem-solving skills are important at the workplace in Culinary Arts
   for initiating innovative and creative solutions. However, graduates
   from community colleges in Malaysia seem to have only average level of
   problem-solving skills, while instructors do not seem to emphasise
   developing problem-solving skills when conducting lessons. Hence,
   providing more opportunities in solving real-world problems for work is
   required. A Flipped Classroom approach begins with activities conducted
   with video lectures on key concepts and gatekeeper quizzes to be
   completed before class and in-class phase spent on applying concepts
   learned before class using problem-solving activities. In this study, a
   Problem-Solving Flipped Classroom (PSFC) module designed for students in
   the Culinary Arts programme in a Malaysian Community College based on
   Merrill's First Principles of Instruction and the Cognitive
   Apprenticeship framework was employed and implemented among 30
   first-semester students and one participating instructor in a selected
   Community College. The single group pretest and post test
   quasi-experimental design was used to investigate the effectiveness of
   the PSFC module for learning and problem solving. Using t-test analysis,
   the findings indicated that the students had significant learning gains
   and improvement in problem-solving skills after using the module. Hence,
   the PSFC module could be used in Culinary Arts at other Community
   Colleges and TVET institutions to improve problem-solving skills among
   Culinary Arts students. This is to ensure a significant amount of
   instruction at Community Colleges include problem-solving instruction
   using authentic tasks at a level suitable for students to acquire
   problem-solving skills required in the workforce.},

   department participated in this qualitative study. The study was
   conducted in the Statistics and Probability course and lasted for 11
   weeks. Findings were organized under four themes as positive opinions,
   negative opinions, suggestions and the use of flipped classrooms in
   mathematics teaching. The findings showed that flipped classrooms had
   positive effects on prospective teachers' active participation in the
   lesson, self-regulation and teamwork skills. On the other hand, not
   making any revision of the subjects during the course and technical
   problems were found as the negative sides of the flipped classroom. The
   findings showed that it was important to establish a mechanism for
   arranging the self-regulation of students. In this context, Kahoot
   activities could be a useful way to make sure all students watch lecture
   videos before the class. It was also found that prospective teachers had
   different opinions on the use of flipped classrooms in mathematics
   teaching. Some prospective teachers would tend to use flipped learning
   when they start their careers for students to come prepared for the
   course and be responsible for their learning process. However, it was
   found that some prospective teachers would not implement flipped
   learning in their lessons since mathematics education should be only be
   carried out traditionally.},

Abstract = {This study analyzes the effects of the use of adapted flipped classroom
   approach on the programming success, attitudes, and self-efficacy of the
   students in learning programming. The study was conducted in the
   2016-2017 fall semester with freshman students in Introduction to
   Programming and Algorithm course in the Software Engineering Department
   of a university in Turkey. The sample of the study consists of 46
   students taking this course for the first time. The quasi-experimental
   research method was used in the study. One group pretest-posttest design
   was employed, and quantitative data were obtained from the students. The
   scale of attitude toward computer programming, computer programming
   self-efficacy scale, computer programming success test, and practice
   control chart were used as data collection tools. The study results show
   that the use of this approach in programming learning has a positive
   effect on the students' programming success and programming
   self-efficacy while it does not affect their attitudes toward
   programming. Additionally, it is concluded that there is a highly
   positive relationship between the numbers of students' fulfilling the
   programming tasks and their programming success. Another conclusion of
   the study is that there is a positive relationship at a medium level
   between the numbers of students' fulfilling the programming tasks and
   programming self-efficacy and their attitudes toward programming.
   Considering the study results as a whole, it is seen that flipped
   classroom approach can be adapted to teach programming.},

Title = {Pre-class teacher feedback in the flipped classroom: cognitive or praise
   feedback is better than mitigating feedback},
Journal = {INNOVATIONS IN EDUCATION AND TEACHING INTERNATIONAL},
Abstract = {The present study examined whether different types of teacher feedback
   in a university flipped classroom pre-class activity could improve
   students' self-regulated learning skills, learning performance, and
   learning satisfaction. In a repeated measures design (N = 31) the
   teacher gave a different type of feedback (no feedback vs. cognitive
   feedback vs. praise feedback vs. mitigating feedback) to questions that
   students posted on the course discussion platform. At the end of each
   week the students completed a self-regulated learning questionnaire,
   learning satisfaction questionnaire, and learning performance test.
   Repeated measures ANOVAs revealed that all forms of teacher feedback
   enhanced students' learning performance and self-regulated learning
   skills, especially the cognitive feedback and praise feedback but not
   their learning satisfaction.},

Abstract = {Purpose - The purpose of this paper is to illustrate the implementation
   of the flipped classroom method in teaching the course and to
   investigate the student's perceived helpfulness, learning outcomes and
   satisfaction in respect of the pre-class learning videos.
   Design/methodology/approach - Pre-class learning videos were integrated
   into a course to encourage students to acquire knowledge before lectures
   and workshops. Having completed the flipped classroom, a delivery
   questionnaire containing all items was distributed to all of the
   participants. The data collected were analysed statistically, using a
   structured equation modelling technique.
   Findings - Findings indicate that the perceived quality of experience of
   using videos before lectures and workshops has a positive influence on
   the perceived helpfulness of the pre-class learning videos. Furthermore,
   the perceived helpfulness of the pre-class learning videos has a
   positive effect of the acquisition perceived learning outcomes. The
   perceived helpfulness of the pre-class learning videos also has a
   positive impact on the student satisfaction with the course. Finally,
   there is a positive and causal relationship between the perceived
   learning outcomes and student's satisfaction with the course.
   Originality/value - Analysis reveals that the learning process and
   student satisfaction are improved by using pre-class learning videos.},

Abstract = {The development of new teaching-learning methods in higher education
   require the contribution of scientific evidence that indicates whether
   these types of methodologies are effective. The aim of this study was to
   assess the effect of an intervention programme based on the combination
   of flipped classroom and peer instruction on the grades of university
   students in an academic subject. Fifty-two university students of the
   3rd course of PhysicalActivity and Sports Sciences Degree participated
   in this quasi-experimental study. The contents of the subject were
   taught through three lessons by a methodological combination of flipped
   classroom and peer instruction in the experimental group, while in the
   control group the same contents and number of lessons were taught
   following a traditional methodology. The students' grades were measured
   in a part of the subject by means a theoretical exam to assess the
   effectiveness of the two types of methodologies implemented. The results
   of the study showed a positive and significant association between
   receiving lessons with the methodological combination and getting the
   different exam questions right. Therefore, the combination of this
   methodologies seems to be more effective than the traditional
   methodology for improving the understanding in university students.},

Title = {Introducing early-phase medical students to clinical paediatrics using
   simulation and a flipped-classroom},
Journal = {JOURNAL OF PAEDIATRICS AND CHILD HEALTH},
Year = {2019},
Volume = {55},
Number = {9},

Month = {SEP},
Abstract = {Aim Both simulation and the flipped-classroom improve learning outcomes
   in medical education, with evidence emerging that they are effective in
   combination ('flipped-simulation'). Previous studies evaluating
   simulation in paediatrics have assessed efficacy for senior students.
   This study aimed to assess whether using flipped-simulation in
   early-phase medical student education would show similar benefits.
   Methods A flipped-simulation session was introduced into the earliest
   phase of the University of New South Wales Sydney's undergraduate
   medical program. A pre-test-post-test study design was used to assess
   short-term knowledge gains with an eight-item quiz administered before
   and after students attended the session. A retrospective cohort design
   was used to assess long-term knowledge retention, with student scores
   from a 10-item quiz administered at the second-phase paediatric course
   orientation, compared between a group that completed the
   flipped-simulation course and a group that attended an alternative
   play-based session. Additional survey data regarding student
   satisfaction were gathered. Results Students demonstrated short-term
   knowledge gains: mean test scores improved from the pre-test to
   post-test (3.4 +/- 1.5 vs. 6.0 +/- 1.3, P < 0.001). Students attending
   the flipped-simulation course retained knowledge more effectively in the
   longer term: mean test scores of students who completed the
   flipped-simulation session were significantly higher than those who
   attended the alternative play-based session (4.4 +/- 1.9 vs. 3.4 +/-
   1.8, P < 0.001). Survey data demonstrated high student confidence in
   practical skills. Conclusion Combining simulation and the
   flipped-classroom is effective for early-phase medical students, with
   improved knowledge over the short and long term, and high student
   satisfaction.},

Abstract = {Computer programming is a difficult subject for most novice programming
   students which leads to a high rate of dropout or failure. Flipped
   classrooms have been increasingly used to teach programming students to
   practice their programming skills in the class based on their knowledge
   acquired from outside the classroom. This study investigated students'
   learning achievement which was measured by their performance on a coding
   test and an exam. We compared students' programming test scores of the
   traditional classroom in semester 1 of the academic year 2016 with the
   flipped classroom in semester 1 in 2017. In addition, we studied
   students' perception of flipped classrooms in a structured programming
   course. The population of this study consisted of 69 second-year
   students of the Information and Communication Technology programme in
   the Faculty of Science, Prince of Songkla University, Thailand. The
   research instrument for investigating students' perception of flipped
   classrooms was a questionnaire. Students were positive in their
   perception of flipped classrooms and agreed that in-class activities
   improved their understanding of concepts. Moreover, students in the
   flipped classroom environment had a significantly higher test score
   compared to students in a traditional lecture class.},

Abstract = {This article presents the results of three flipped classroom experiences
   carried out with university students, with the aim of promoting
   students' commitment to learning and, at the same time, knowing their
   assessments of the proposal. The study, conducted in 2017, involved 124
   subjects enrolled in various professorships at the Universidad Nacional
   de Rio Cuarto. Each experience was developed using Facebook as a virtual
   platform. For data collection, a questionnaire of open and closed
   questions was used, administered at the end of each experience. Among
   the results, the participation dynamics, interest and autonomy were
   highlighted as indicators of the commitment perceived by the students
   towards the new teaching-learning modality. Likewise, the students
   remarked that the proposal was interesting, suggesting more inverted
   classes and extrapolating them to other subjects.},

Abstract = {This study assesses whether the use of the Flipped Classroom methodology
   supported by explanations by teachers through a Learning management
   system (Blackboard) produces an alteration in the attitudes towards
   statistics of future teachers of Primary education, with gender
   interaction. For this, a quasi-experimental design (pretest / post-test)
   was used, and as a statistical technique a mixed ANOVA with three
   repeated measures. The sample was 66 students from the Faculty of
   Education of the University of Almeria (UAL). To carry out the
   comparative analysis of attitudes towards statistics, the CAHE
   instrument created by Camacho et al. (2016) made up of a total of 16
   items, classified into three dimensions: negative emotional (fear, fear,
   tension towards statistics), positive emotional (liking, liking, fun
   towards statistics), and utility towards statistics. The results showed
   statistically significant differences between the students' attitudes
   between the pre-test and the post-test, but not the interaction with
   gender. The results highlight that the use of the Flipped Classroom
   methodology can help improve attitudes towards statistical research,
   being an essential weapon for any teacher who wants to innovate in their
   classes.},

Abstract = {The advancement and rising of information technology have promoted the
   flipped classroom in an effective way. It flips knowledge transfer and
   knowledge internalization from two levels of teaching structure and
   teaching process, reversing the traditional teaching knowledge transfer
   in class and knowledge deepening after class from time and space.
   Although the use of flipped classrooms in ideological and political
   theory courses is relatively uncommon in colleges and universities,
   realistic teaching and related study findings in some colleges and
   universities provide some reference value for the use of flipped
   classrooms in ideological and political theory courses. As a result, the
   short- and long-time memory network-based flipped classroom design
   algorithm for ideological and political courses in colleges and
   universities has a wide range of applications. A neural network
   prediction model based on a hybrid genetic algorithm is developed in
   this paper. The hybrid genetic algorithm is used in this model to
   determine the optimal dropout probability and the number of cells in the
   hidden layer of the neural network. The hybrid genetic algorithm will
   lengthen the memory neural network to predict the teaching quality of
   root mean square error between real value and predictive value as a
   fitness function, in the process of optimization, genetic algorithm
   convergence to the local optimal solution of the area.},

   medical molecular biology course},
Journal = {JOURNAL OF BIOLOGICAL EDUCATION},
Abstract = {This study aims to compare the influences of traditional lectures (TL)
   with a flipped classroom (FC). Two consecutive classes of students from
   a laboratory medicine speciality learned medical molecular biology
   through the flipped or nonflipped (TL) approach with online
   microlectures. We inspected examination scores, learning experiences and
   perceptions of the FC model and peer collaboration in the course by
   means of mixed-methods. The average examination score for the 2016 FC
   students was higher than that for the 2017 traditional students. The
   course evaluations submitted by the students showed positive learning
   experiences and perceptions of the FC model. The flipped approach also
   increased peer collaboration. This research reveals the positive
   influences of FC with online microlectures on learning. It is proposed
   that future research evaluates the influences of FC on the other courses
   in laboratory medicine higher education.},

Abstract = {The authors analyze the modern view of the goals and content of
   secondary and higher education at the present stage, consider the
   features of teaching foreign languages for students of non-linguistic
   specialties, the place of foreign languages in the formation of
   specialists with competencies required by state educational and
   professional standards. Currently prevailing methods in education,
   according to some authors, contribute to the weakening of creative,
   lateral thinking and do not meet the needs and challenges of modern
   society. The use of innovative, personally and professionally oriented
   methods in the system of secondary and higher education is necessary and
   possible, despite the rigid system framework in the form of class-lesson
   system or training in the stream at universities.
   The article presents the technology flipped classroom and shows its
   advantages in teaching foreign languages: taking into account the
   individual characteristics of students, building an individual learning
   trajectory, the ability to learn a foreign language in heterogeneous
   groups of students, the practical orientation of training, as well as
   the development of the system of tutoring, teamwork and cooperation
   among students.
   The use of this technology for teaching French at the University for
   students of some economic specialties is particularly interesting. The
   authors summarize the experience of colleagues who have successfully
   used the technology flipped classroom in teaching French at universities
   in Estonia and Latin America. There is an increase in academic
   performance, increased motivation to learn the French language, more
   involvement of students in the educational process.
   The technology flipped classroom has a number of requirements for the
   level of training of teachers and to equip universities. The authors
   objectively describe the difficulties of using the technology at the
   initial stage: the increase in time to prepare for classes, the need for
   the good skills of using multimedia resources and technologies, possible
   resistance from colleagues and administration.
   The authors analyze their own experience gained in the course of
   teaching French as a first and second foreign language at the
   University. The positive results of the experimental training are
   presented such as improving academic performance, increasing the number
   of students choosing French as a second foreign language, the growth of
   satisfaction on the part of students identified in the annual survey.},

Abstract = {This paper presents a methodology that encourages and fosters proactive
   student participation in individual and collaborative learning. The
   methodology combines Flipped Classroom, Formative Assessment and
   Continuous Assessment, Project-Based Learning, and Problem Solving using
   Simulators strategies, with an integrated teaching and learning system
   (ITLS), called SIENA. The tool serves to automate some of the processes
   inherent in the methodology and serves as a bridge across all of the
   educational process involved. The methodology has been tested in both
   undergraduate and postgraduate degrees in Computer Engineering studies,
   the former in a blended learning subject and the last in an online
   subject findings to date have proven positive. In addition, we have
   applied a unified theory of acceptance and use of technology model to
   ITLS and it has proven to be a useful tool in the learning process.},

Abstract = {Purpose - The confidence placed in the use of technology and other
   computing resources is an important support for the deep transformation
   toward processes of very high quality teaching-learning based on active
   learning. This paper aims to present and describe a higher education
   experience with Flipped Learning before and during the transformation of
   education due to the COVID-19 pandemic. In addition, the study analyzes
   the effectiveness perceived by university students of Flipped Learning
   for the development of competencies for the 21st century.
   Design/methodology/approach - For this study, a quantitative methodology
   is used in which 376 university students fill out a questionnaire after
   experiencing several sessions with an inverted classroom under both
   onsite and online instructions.
   Findings - On average, the results show a high agreement among students
   on the benefits or effectiveness that learning designs with Flipped
   Classroom have on the development of skills that will be useful for
   their personal and professional future. These competencies include
   character building, collaboration, communication, citizenship, critical
   thinking and creativity. At the same time, and depending on some control
   variables such as the modality of teaching (onsite or online), the
   course, the predisposition to innovate or previous experience with
   innovation, significant differences are also observed.
   Originality/value - Education and learning have the need to respond to
   the different educational and training needs for the future. In this
   sense, the Flipped Classroom methodology allows the development of
   skills for the 21st century. In turn, this approach also makes it
   possible to approach blended learning. Experiences such as the one
   described in this study will characterize the future of education.},

Abstract = {With the rapid development of the Internet, traditional teaching models
   can no longer meet the needs of talent training in colleges and
   universities, and reform is imperative. With the advent of the era of
   big data, the emergence of a large number of rich and diverse teaching
   resources, MOOC (Massive Online Open Course), microclasses, flipped
   classrooms, and other teaching models on the Internet has provided
   reform thinking and directions for teaching reform. This model divides
   the entire teaching design into two major modules: SPOC (Small Private
   Online Course) platform teaching activity design and flipped classroom
   teaching activity design, and applies this model to the actual teaching
   of open education, designing detailed teaching activity plans, in a real
   teaching situation. This study uses questionnaire surveys and interview
   surveys to investigate the basic personal situation of course learners,
   learning expectations, course participation, learning experience, and
   learning effects. It is planned to use the questionnaire star platform
   to issue and return questionnaires and use EXCEL and SPSS software to
   analyze the data and perform analysis and processing, combined with
   in-depth interviews with learners and professors for comprehensive
   analysis, so as to obtain the most true views of students and teachers
   on this model. In this process, we collect a variety of data from the
   SPOC platform and the flipped classroom platform, including feedback
   from students studying on the SPOC platform before class, observation of
   students' learning attitudes in flipped classrooms to display of
   students' results after class, and academic performance, summarize
   experience based on the analysis results, and optimize the teaching
   design plan. In classification algorithms, support vector machines (SVM)
   are widely used due to their advantages such as less overfitting and
   inconspicuous dimensionality of feature vectors. The traditional SVM
   algorithm is not suitable for processing large-scale data sets due to
   factors such as high time complexity and long training time. In order to
   solve these shortcomings, parallelizing the SVM algorithm to process
   large-scale data sets is an effective solution. On the basis of
   comparison, a SPOC-based flipped classroom teaching design model was
   constructed, and empirical application was carried out in the Open
   University, in order to promote the sustainable development of open
   education.},

Abstract = {Few teaching concepts have received as much attention in recent years as
   the Flipped Classroom (FC). This is clearly linked to media attention on
   the concept, which is currently being intensified by the Corona
   pandemic. In this research, the media rise of the concept is explained
   and the discrepancy between popularity and empirically validated
   research results is clarified. While the literature basis for the FC has
   grown enormously over the last decade, reviews and initial meta-analyses
   have shown, through their filter criteria, that not many of studies can
   meet scientific standards. The comparison of individual studies is
   particularly difficult, because there is no uniformly accepted framework
   and no uniform definition of the concept. For this reason, one of the
   goals of this research was to give an overview of the variety of FC
   definitions, discuss its most controversial characteristics, and to
   provide the key elements for a definition of the FC. A comparison of
   selected studies and reviews shows an assessment of the effectiveness of
   the teaching concept. The findings shed light on potential problems and
   challenges, and provide directions for future research.},

Abstract = {In this study, combined method using pre and post oral proficiency
   tests, observation, and focus group interviews were used to examine the
   effectiveness of using flipped classroom model on English speaking
   performance. The study population consists of 27 undergraduate students
   who were attending the course of Advanced Communication Skills, in the
   academic year of 2018. A purposeful sampling technique, specifically
   quasi-experimental procedure was employed in this study. The analysis of
   quantitative and qualitative data showed that the application of FCM was
   an effective approach in the EFL speaking classroom. The results of
   paired-sample t-test indicated that there was a significant difference
   between pre and post oral proficiency tests t (26) = -14.83, p<0.001.
   Moreover, it was found that students' involvement and willingness to
   participate in the English conversational tasks and their level of
   commitment and English speaking performance have increased gradually. In
   light of the findings, the study recommended encouraging teachers to
   employ modem technologies in their teaching strategies, particularly
   FCM.},
